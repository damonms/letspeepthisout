 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty all right everyone let's get it it's Ian K back again with another high quality foodie feature for you here on peep this out reviews this time returning to good old bk because it looks like they're kicking off their all new feel good about the food initiative which promotes foods free of colors flavors and preservatives from artificial sources and the first item on the menu to kickstart it is obviously going to be their flagship the whopper or as they put it the whopper and nothing but the whopper let's take a look at it guys with that very familiar sesame seed bun and underneath it we've got plenty of chopped lettuce we've got mayo sliced tomato and as we go a little further onions pickles and ketchup and although you can't see it on top of the flame grilled beef there's an extra couple of shakes of additional seasoning to add even more flavor to the overall laundry list of ingredients that the whopper's got and underneath that we've actually got nothing on the very bottom of the bun but guys it's the classic whopper but the main focus aside from everything you've heard up to this point is the fact that the mayo and the pickles are actually taking part in that initiative and i'll explain it a little further as we get further into this one but guys it's the 100% real whopper here at bk let's peep out this flavor so yeah no need to do a double take with this one guys like i said at the very top of this one this may be known as the whopper and nothing but the whopper in the marketing but what it's actually called is the 100% real whopper and as you guys can see it's the classic whopper that you know and love only it's got a lot more goodness to go with and that's because all the main ingredients are free of any of those colors flavors and preservatives from artificial sources and that now includes the newly added pickles and mayo to the list moving forward that's right you heard me correctly the pickles in the mayo in the past couldn't be said to be free of flavors colors of preservatives from artificial sources but now they can because now it is 100% natural with everything else on it and again really quick as you can see it's that classic whopper very very tasty stuff and of course we're going to get into it right now but of course before i do and like always if you

for a while you're probably gonna remember that i reviewed something called the new whopper a couple of years ago and that's essentially exactly what this is right now just with that upgraded ingredients list as you heard me say at the top of the review so while i'm not necessarily going to be giving a numbered rating to the whopper right now because actually this is pretty much the same thing you can take a look at my original review popping up on your screen right now this is more of me wanting to give this a shot to see if there's going to be a little bit of a flavor difference and so far i'm not getting one which is not a bad thing because it's still very very tasty let me go for one more quick bite i'm gonna give you some close-ups but guys it's the whopper it's good but it's a little bit better for you now let's keep going well i'm definitely a fan of the flame grilled beef over here at bk and that flavor is absolutely timeless guys just like i remember as a kid and with the fresh ingredients on the top of this one it really does stand out now for me i'm a big fan of pickles and being that the pickles are included in this initiative right now as being really really better for you let me just say they are very very tasty they have nice snap nice flavor nice acidity and overall it is still very very fresh tasting but just knowing that it's better for you on top of it is that much more of a bonus hey as far as i'm concerned anything that can deliver the exact same flavor that you're used to and in this case the flavor from the whopper but without the preservatives the colors and the extra flavors coming from things that you probably don't even want to have in your body anyway it's probably going to be a pretty good thing in fact i know it's going to be a good thing because guys that's really how it should be and while it's great to have other sustainable sources of protein in this case the beef is pretty awesome but naturally with plant-based stuff that you're seeing on the market right now if they can do the same thing with that pretty much across the board i think that's just gonna be that much more of a bonus because guys it's all about going all natural it's all about having choice it's all about putting things into your body that are gonna make sense and personally for me i like the idea of seeing no artificial colors no artificial flavorings no artificial preservatives added extra to what we already know to be the flavor from bk in general so for me personally i really like that let's go for another bite so aside from the pickles taking part in this initiative we've got the mayo as well and obviously i'm not really a super fan of mayo so that's not really a big thing for me but it's nice to know that now we've got 100% across the board a very natural whopper with all the good stuff on the inside not bad whatsoever so yeah pretty tasty stuff i mean it's the classic whopper made the bk way but now it's made actually better for you and that's really the bonus as far as i'm concerned and the main initiative push for why you're seeing this right now so just to round this one out like i mentioned at the top of this video the whopper nothing but the whopper is the main campaign to get this started but i have no doubt we're probably going to see some other stuff on the menu take part in this as well who knows maybe the chicken sandwiches are some other items but guys it's all good and that's the goal so let me grab one more bite of this 100% real whopper and then we'll round this one out real fast guys pretty good all right so one more last look at this one before we finish this video out and obviously guys classic bk goodness here of course the flame grilled beef that you know and love with all the fresh fixings on the top and now everything can be included in that comment guys everything is fresh free of preservatives colors and flavorings from artificial sources and you have a lot to look forward to if you're a big fan of the whopper anyway really tasty overall no colors flavors or preservatives from artificial sources all right so since i already gave this one a rating a couple of years ago when i reviewed the unquote new whopper the only major difference at that time and this is pretty much the same thing with the fact that the patties are no longer perfectly circular shaped they're a little bit more home style more backyard barbecue style looking and they added that new seasoning sprinkle which definitely elevates it just a little bit but overall it really is the same whopper so take a look at that review like i mentioned earlier you'll find my overall detailed breakdown and rating in that review of course but when it comes to me just recommending that you give this one a shot guys absolutely i would if you're a fan of the whopper you're gonna do that anyway but it's nice to know that it's 100% real and i like the aspect of calling that because it really does signify exactly what it is 100% real 100% real whopper pretty solid all right so now the obvious question now that you know that the ingredients are a lot more natural in the whopper going forward are you going to be giving this one a shot drop some comments down below and also let me know is the whopper your favorite fast food burger very curious to hear your thoughts on this one and
