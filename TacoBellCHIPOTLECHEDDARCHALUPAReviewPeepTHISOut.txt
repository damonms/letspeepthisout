 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty what's going on everyone and welcome back to  another high quality foodie feature for you   here on the channel we're this time over a taco  bell on a cold wet rainy day here in southern   cali to check out what looks to be a heated  little upgrade for a fan favorite menu item   so here it is guys feast your eyes on the chipotle  cheddar chalupa and what initially looks like a   very familiar item here on the taco bell menu but  it's got something just a little extra with it   alright so starting off with the outside what  we've got here is a soft flaky flatbread like   chalupa shell filled up with the good stuff and  as we take a look on the inside you're going to   find a pretty decent portion all throughout of  seasoned beef lettuce chipotle sauce tomatoes   and shredded cheddar cheese and again it looks  like all the familiar tropes over here at taco   bell but with the addition of that chipotle  sauce adding just a little bit of heat i'm   thinking i think this is going to be pretty  decent i mean at the very least it's going to   taste like taco bell so how bad could that be  all right so let's not waste any more time on   this one this is the chipotle cheddar chalupa  here at taco bell let's peep out this flavor   yes sir some much needed rain is completely  pounding my car here right now guys so this   is definitely adding to the overall experience  because this chalupa is nice and warm in my hand   so let me show you again really quickly before i  bite into this one nice and toasty nice and flaky   on the outside it's definitely soft very familiar  of course and naturally with all the good stuff   right there in the middle as you can see a very  solid amount of that chipotle sauce can be seen on   the very bottom of this one guys let's not waste  any more time i think this is going to be kind of   familiar it's the all-new quote-unquote chipotle  cheddar chalupa here at taco bell let's do it familiar tasty though all right right off the  break aside from the familiar flavors this has   definitely got a very nice amount of sizzle guys  i mean it's definitely pretty nice you can feel it   pretty nicely and it goes pretty amazing with all  the goodness that you're seeing on the inside of   here all the familiar flavors of taco bell the  seasoned beef you already know what to expect   from this one and of course that dovetails right  into the light crunch that i'm getting from the   lettuce and the tomatoes that are on this as  well but the cheddar cheese believe it or not   it's a little non-existent in flavor because  of that chipotle sauce but still pretty tasty   yeah absolutely familiar flavor and i can kind  of see why they don't have sour cream mixed in   with this because they really want you to taste  the chipotle sauce although i do have to admit   adding a little bit of that sour cream kind of  tang and that little bite that you get from that   would go pretty nicely with the heat that i'm  guessing from here but they want the experience   to be the chipotle i get it it's in the title  but at the same time i think a little sour cream   would have been pretty nice on this all right so  let's go a little deeper into this one hang on well the chalupa is popular for a reason guys  because that light butteriness that i'm getting   in the overall feeling of the chalupa shell itself  is adding so much to the overall flavors of taco   bell in general along with that chipotle sauce and  as you can see here with the further cross-section   shot a very solid amount of that seasoned beef  as always and plenty of all the other good stuff   there but i gotta say again a little sour cream  would have been pretty awesome on this but at   the same time still enjoying it but on the real  there's a little bit of a missed opportunity with   this one i'm thinking because guys honestly when  i first saw this was coming out i figured is this   the toasted cheddar chalupa but with chipotle  sauce that would have been a lovely situation   having the cheese on the outside so this is really  just the standard stuff but with the chipotle   sauce thrown in to make it quote-unquote new  but at the same time i think the toasted cheddar   chalupa would have been a much better pairing with  this on top of that maybe a little bit of the sour   cream at $3.59 or so of what i paid for this one i  was kind of expecting just a little bit more from   it but at the same time again familiar taco bell  flavor with that chipotle sauce still pretty tasty   all right so let me go for one more bite on  this one because if you've seen one chalupa   you've seen them all they're pretty much the same  with the exception of maybe a sauce or something a   little bit different in this case it's just the  chipotle sauce added to it but again familiar   familiar familiar you're pretty much hearing that  theme all throughout the review because it is   it's still taco bell it's still tasty one  more bite we'll wrap this review up hang on   well the main highlights for this one are easily  going to be that chalupa shell which easily kicks   the flavor off guys and that unique texture  that it's got is really adding to the overall   experience combining that with the seasoned beef  and that chipotle sauce action what you're gonna   get is the garnishment on top there with the  lettuce the tomatoes and a little bit of shredded   cheddar cheese although it's not very pronounced  in the flavor i'm very surprised that that's in   the name of this one maybe a cheese sauce would  have been better but again sour cream of course   this needs just a little bit more to really  stand out but as it stands it's a very solid   entry for the taco bell menu and especially for a  promo item right now if you love chalupas this is   guaranteed to satisfy you either way order ahead  and pick yours up at our contactless drive-thru   aaaah taco bell the six or seven main flavors you  have on your menu recycled in so many different   ways with this one in particular this is pretty  much something i could have customized to make but   hey it is technically something new as we round  out the year still pretty solid though it's tasty   so with that said i'm gonna have to give the  chipotle cheddar chalupa here a taco bell just an OK   7 out of 10 again there's really nothing  else to really say about this one guys it's the   exact same chalupa that you know and love although  i do wish it had a little bit of toasted cheddar   on the outside i think that would have made a  huge difference just visually and overall flavor   because like i said that shredded cheddar cheese  does not stand out at all it's a chipotle show a   seasoned beef show and of course the chalupa shell  show on top of it the main three highlights still   pretty tasty even better on a rainy day right  now let me just tell you all right so a couple   of quick questions for you first and foremost is  the chalupa your main favorite item here on the   taco bell menu and if it isn't what is and why  drop those comments down below and definitely   let me know
