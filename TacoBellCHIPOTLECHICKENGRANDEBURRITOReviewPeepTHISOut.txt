 hey everyone I'm back at it this time at taco bell for a little grande burrito action so stay tuned cuz it's up next welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty so here we got with the chipotle chicken grande burrito here at taco bell and initial impressions I think somebody didn't get the memo on how to make this correctly because this is looking really small it almost feels like an appetizer to the main event but as you guys can see here what we've got a is tortilla filled with shredded chicken seasoned rice and some chipotle sauce for a buck and it's supposed to be a lot bigger than it looks here guys but man kind of disappointing already lemme just lift this up just to give you perspective here this is really really thin this really doesn't look like it's worth a dollar to be honest it's really tiny but as you can see it looks like it's filled pretty decently but man a little disappointing so far let's see if the flavor's gonna deliver on this one I really hope it does at this point it's the chipotle chicken grande burrito here at taco bell for a buck let's peep out this flavor yeah man grande is in the title for this particular one but it's not necessarily in the product that I got here right now guys just look at this in my hand this is exactly half of it and this looks really really small I'm pretty disappointed and I think the main reason I'm so disappointed is because of the way they make it look in the picture I know they're supposed to up it for advertising but guys this doesn't look like it's packed at all but grande it is what it is alright so before I get started and like always if you guys are fans of high quality delicious looking food reviews make sure to hit that subscribe button down below and don't forget to tap the bell icon so you can be notified as soon as brand new content drops every week guys it's the chipotle chicken grande burrito here at taco bell let's do it I mean the flavor's alright little bit of heat the shredded chicken is nice and moist it's actually not bad flavor-wise and I was really hoping it was gonna be at least that but it doesn't feel like it is packed enough and like I said for what they're advertising very disappointing so far on this one guys and that's strictly because the quantity is not there I mean I really though this was gonna be a lot bigger than it was now considering they actually have another version of these available I believe it's the loaded taco one I did a variation of that one back in the day when that was actually out that actually had avocado ranch sauce take a look at that review popping up on your screen right now if you're curious about that one I almost feel like I should've gotten that one as well because this is not gonna satisfy especially for the dollar price point but guys it's just OK for what this is so far let's got for another bite I don't wanna go too deep on this one half here because I wanna give more of a look at it because obviously you can kill this in about 4 bites considering the size so enough about this size of this for the time being the overall flavor does deliver the chipotle sauce has got a nice sizzle to it the creaminess is definitely there the shredded chicken is nice and moist there's a decent amount of the shredded chicken considering the size and I know I just broke cardinal rule right now yes I'm talking about the size again but guys the chicken is very tasty on this one the seasoned rice I don't know about the seasoned part but I can definitely feel like I'm eating rice and overall the fluffiness of that tortilla is actually pretty tasty as well so OK for what this is but again for a dollar ehh maybe I'll change my mind this one here I guess it's worth a buck considering the flavor just the size again I know I keep coming back to it because it it was it is I'm just so disappointed I wanted this to be bigger alright I gotta keep going on about the size with this one guys very disappointing taco bell what is going on today let's go for another bite I'll give you another close up of the other half considering that's pretty much gonna be the better shot and then we'll finish this one up after the rating hang on so here's one last shot of this chicken roller for 'ta guys and as you can see this actually looks better than the first half up close actually we've got a little bit more of that seasoned rice to speak of here that shredded chicken and of course that chipotle sauce all wrapped up into this warm tortilla so nice flavor the very familiar good stuff from taco bell but again for a dollar your mileage may vary the new one dollar grande burritos on the cravings value menu so with that said and based on everything you've seen and heard in this review today I'm gonna have to give the chipotle chicken grande burrito here at taco bell just an above average 6 out of 10 and it's only because of the size of this product guys I have to admit like I said very disappointing overall I can't really stress it enough for a dollar I get what they're selling with this one but they're also selling the grande name and I expect it to be just a little bigger than what I got the flavors definitely deliver it's definitely taco bell that you know and love all the tasty good stuff that offer of course is on display for 'ya but guys again it's not grande admit it so do me a quick favor while you're admitting if this is grande or not at least to you drop some comments down below have you had this one already was it a little bit bigger for you overall was it worth the dollar drop those comments down below and definitely lemme know and with that this is Ian K closing out another episode of peep this out bringing you brand new content every single week here
