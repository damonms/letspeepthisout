 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty Burger King lights up their breakfast menu with a trio of all-new breakfast sandwiches and if you're a fan of french toast you have every reason to be excited that's right the new french toast sandwiches have landed here at BK available in either sausage ham and the bacon variant that you guys see here initial first impressions though I have to admit it's a little on the small side but it's still looking pretty tasty nonetheless as you can see we've got the French toast supplying the bun action on this one and on the inside it's gonna have the rest of the breakfast goodies let's take a look here we've got some bacon some melted American cheese we've got some egg looking pretty decent as well see what's on the bottom of this one here and it looks like more of the French toast there so a simple build on this one but all of your breakfast goodies in the palm of your hand and just for fun we're gonna do a little syrup on this one guys I mean it's french toast how could you not right let's see if this one delivers in the flavor it's the bacon egg and cheese french toast sandwich here at BK let's peep out this flavor so are you a fan of high quality delicious looking food reviews well if so definitely hit that subscribe button down below and don't forget to tap that Bell icon so you could be notified as soon as new content drops every week now let's dive into this one well I'm definitely getting hints of french toast in the aroma department aside from the very strong hickory smoke flavor from that bacon which is pretty awesome but again it's a little on the thin side I thought this was gonna be more in line with that breakfast sourdough king that I reviewed a while back which you guys can actually take a look at my playlist if you want to see that one but guys again still looking pretty tasty it's the bacon egg and cheese french toast sandwich here at BK let's do it mmm sweetness coming out of this one already that's actually really good Wow yeah I'm diggin that it's almost like you really don't even need the syrup anyway but we're gonna get into that in just a second but I really like that and naturally because this has been warmed up just a bit it's a little on the soggy side so it's not really crispy even though it's got some of the marks on the top and the bottom as you can see but the bacon is nice and crispy the cheese is melty and of course the egg is decent as well always a fan of the eggs here at BK and it's a decent portion they give you as well let's keep going mmm you know now I'm thinking the syrup that I have for this one as we get further into this review may be a little overkill with this one because it really is a nice balance of what I've got here already guys as you can see I think two or three strips of bacon is perfect for this and we definitely have that here and again the eggs are very fluffy the cheese is melty and the sweetness that I'm getting from that french toast again a little on the thin side but it's really holding its own this is actually a very tasty breakfast sandwich and hey it's only about 380 calories for this too so for a treat every once in a while this is actually pretty good and like I said that sweetness is really on point and that really is a nice sweet and savory flavor that I'm getting with that combination of the bacon along with it pretty good guys pretty good mmm alright so let's see if this syrup is truly gonna be overkill let's get our drizzle on I'm gonna try and do this as carefully as possible and get some right in the middle there we go and like I said earlier you got to do syrup with french toast right yeah this definitely smells pretty sweet let's do it mmm that actually kicks it up very very nicely get a side of syrup if you go for this one guys oh man that is delicious I was really worried that syrup was gonna kick this one just a little over the top and thankfully it doesn't really take it up too too sweet although the syrup itself does have a nice sweetness on its own the combination is nice my only gripe though is I really wish the French toast was just a little bit thicker they really have a winner here with this one they just needs to be a little bit larger in that department and it would just be primo but guys get this syrup with this I'm telling you right now you are gonna absolutely thank me for it seems like it's getting thinner and thinner as I'm getting further into this one but as you can see guys all the main ingredients on display for you there with a good chunk of the bacon take him out with that last bite that syrup really was pretty nice guys the sweetness along with the savoriness and the smokiness of that bacon together was awesome so really really tasty on this one and if your up for breakfast early regardless definitely give this a go it's highly worth your time it's tasty so let's not waste any more time on this one scoring wise because if this one was being based strictly by adding syrup to it it would be a rock-solid 9 out of 10 the overall sweetness from the syrup itself on top of the light sweetness from the french toast that you're getting in the sandwich is really really delicious guys the combination works extremely well as it should because syrup and french toast just go hand in hand so thankfully it's not crazy over the top and it adds just the right amount if you asked me to really kick it up to a really comfortable level but on its own it's still just a very very tasty breakfast sandwich aside from it being just a little on the thin side so I'm not gonna beat that one to death any further with it because I think you get the point by now so with that said I'm gonna have to give the bacon egg and cheese french toast sandwich here at BK a pretty decent 8 out of 10 at $3.49 I think it's just a little elevated in the price department but I do have to admit the taste is definitely there it's a very simple ingredients list but it's everything you'd like from a breakfast on a Sunday morning especially in the palm of your hand pretty tasty try the new french toast sandwich only at Burger King but of course that begs the question based upon my review right now did you think it looked pretty tasty drop some comments down below are you a breakfast person in general and if you are are you gonna be
