receipt and your all set man very cool brother appreciate ya thank you man thanks again all right so like most of you guys i'm sure you're a fan of the chicken sandwich over here at chick-fil-a i mean it's a classic for a reason right so if these chick-n-strips are half as good as that minus the bun of course i think i'm going to be pretty satisfied Ian yeah how you doing i'm doing fine and yourself very cool my friend thanks so much have a beautiful day stay frosty you too alright guys let's peep this out all right so here we go with the chick-n-strips here at chick-fil-a and already i am digging the crispiness of this situation guys this is looking really really nice feast your eyes on the breading on the outside of these looking nice and crispy what we've got here is a three-piece order of white meat chicken breast that's marinated in special seasonings before it's hand breaded and then pressure cooked in 100% peanut oil so it's looking really really nice and crispy let me lift one of these up here to show you very very hot decent thickness on the amount of white meat here and of course that crispiness is definitely looking awesome and as the box says underneath it here to dip or not to dip well you know what we're gonna have to go in on it guys we're gonna do some chick-fil-a sauce and we're gonna do some ranch so let's not waste any more time on this one it's the chick-n-strips here at chick-fil-a let's peep out this flavor so yeah like i was saying i always get the chicken sandwiches when i come to chick-fil-a i never really think to get the chicken strips because the iconic chicken sandwich is the main reason i'm coming over here and i always said if i'm ever gonna do this officially i'm gonna put it on my channel and review it for you guys and guys and i have to admit again this is actually looking really really good let me get that focused in there so you can see nice and crispy nice and golden it really looks like one of their chicken patties just chopped up in thirds and there you go maybe a little extra breading that i'm used to here but it looks really really good okay so before i jump into these right now and like always if you guys

drops every week guys the chick-n-strips here at chick-fil-a and again let me give you another close-up here nice and crispy that white meat is really shining through you can see it it's not overly breaded but it looks like it's got a little bit of extra to it here let's give it a shot the chick-n-strips at chick-fil-a yeah definitely meaty and very vibrant in flavor that is chick-fil-a naturally when i have it here this actually feels like it's a little bit extra breaded compared to what i thought it was gonna be like it looked like it was a little bit extra anyway but for some reason as i've been into that one it was a lot of crispiness a lot of crunchiness a lot of falling apart at the same time but guys the quality is really really nice and as you can see by the breading here it's light but it feels heavier in those first bites there but take a look at that let me see if i can focus that in that white meat chicken is a beautiful situation as you can see it's very thick it's juicy these are fairly warm now not as hot but as you can see a very crispy situation nonetheless so i'm having an easy time holding this right now because it's beginning to cool off okay and because this is just chicken strips this is not really going to take too long let's just jump right into chick-fil-a sauce first thing here guys this is definitely a lovely situation a little bit of like barbecue honey mustard this tastes like to me for some reason but let me give this a shot with it and we'll go for a couple of dips here one in this one in the ranch take a look at that nice and thick lovely situation let's give this a shot chick-fil-a sauce with the chick-n-strips here with chick-fil-a yeah that sweetness of the barbecue sauce and the honey mustard flavor that i'm getting with this on top of it it's a lovely situation whenever i get the chicken sandwiches here at chick-fil-a i do a combination of chick-fil-a sauce and ranch and speaking of ranch let's just get right into that right now most of you guys know one of my all-time favorite dipping sauces of choice and with chicken ranch is a no-brainer as far as i'm concerned so let's give this a shot the same piece i'm making use of it here let's go for it here some ranch action garlic herb branch or i think just herb ranch they call this one here but this is looking really nice and thick let's give it a shot oh yeah yeah definitely digging the nice tang and the creaminess of ranch when it comes to chick-n-strips and this is no different over here at chick-fil-a a lovely situation and you know what because you're probably thinking it and i'm definitely thinking it right now let's go for a combination of chick-fil-a sauce and ranch together with one of these strips here i'm sure that's going to be a beautiful situation so i've got that chick-fil-a sauce first let's give this a shot we'll get it lathered up right over here at the end and then very carefully because i'm doing this in the car this is definitely a little difficult a lot more difficult than i thought it was going to be to coordinate and we'll do some ranch together here so messy situation but a lovely situation at the same time chick-fil-a sauce and ranch with the chick-n-strips let's do it   yup just give me a bun and i'm having the chick-fil-a sandwich same flavor lovely situation you just can't fade that flavor that chick-fil-a has with their chicken here and considering the size of these pieces these are actually not too bad i guess they're pretty much evenly distributed in terms of the size one does appear to be a little bit longer than the others but generally the thickness is about the same the crispiness is obviously on point and that initial one that i started out with actually had more coating on the outside so as i'm going further in these are a little bit lighter and i'm tasting that chicken just a little bit more but naturally the flavor is awesome it's chick-fil-a it's what you already know from them just in chick-n-strips form without the bun in the pickle all right so let me go for one more bite of this one before we wrap the review up after the rating but guys there is one thing that i wish this actually had and i'm going to tell you what that is coming up here in just a second but one more bite and then we'll close this one out so here's another shot of that crispy goodness guys and as you can see what they do they do very well over here at chick-fil-a very nice coating on this one and of course with that white meat being as juicy as it is and as flavorful as it is just a beautiful combination definitely a recommendation because of what they are easily but there is one particular thing that i wish this actually had and it's coming up right now but first things first let's give it a rating on that scale of 1 to 10 I'm gonna have to give the chick-n-strips here at chick-fil-a a pretty decent 7 out of 10 now the only reason i'm saying that and here's the reason why i think it needs something else it needs to be a little bit less expensive $4.79 for 3 of those is easily not worth it the value is not there so for the price point of getting the sandwich i would easily want to get that i think it'd be more filling but naturally 3 of these chick-n-strips for almost five bucks definitely no bueno guys i would easily recommend the sandwich still and as tasty as they are i'm glad that i actually tried them officially am i gonna get these again you know what it's not really high on the priority list considering the price point of the sandwich being a little bit less expensive and being a little bit more heartier but as it stands that was still tasty to try and i'm glad i did it on camera officially for you but let's just say it's not going to be my go-to the sandwich is always gonna be all right now the obvious question at least to me anyway based upon my experience right now is are these chick-n-strips the go-to item for you when you come to chick-fil-a i mean do you actually come to chick-fil-a specifically for them or is the sandwich still tops in your book drop those comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is
