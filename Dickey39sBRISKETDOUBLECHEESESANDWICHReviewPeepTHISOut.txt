 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty hey everyone its Ian K for peep this our reviews back at it once again over at Dickey's Barbecue Pit to go in on what looks to be some pretty awesome comfort food goodness so let's go in on some legit Texas barbecue here at Dickey's Barbecue Pit with their brisket double cheese sandwich and already I am digging the presentation of this one starting off with a nice glossiness of this bun it looks like we've got some nice meat juices lighting this one up pretty nicely here let's pop the top underneath looks like we've got a helping of their famous mac and cheese definitely keeping it stuck together there for sure and attached to that and also underneath it is their smoked brisket kind of thick cut as well nice and chunky very lovely situation there we've got a slice of cheddar cheese in the very bottom to kind of keep that all together which is actually a very good thing not super melted but looking really really nice but very thick guys and actually what I'm gonna be doing with this is going in on some barbecue sauce about half way in so this is looking like it's gonna be pretty tasty and I got to admit it's gonna complement this sandwich I'm thinkin pretty nicely since it's coming with it anyway they want me to give it a shot and I'm gonna do it just for you so here we go it's the brisket double cheese sandwich here at Dickey's Barbecue Pit some legit goodness let's peep out this flavor yeah this thing pretty much had me as soon as I opened up the wrap on this one guys judging by how wet the top of that bun was I have a lot of high hopes for what's gonna be on the inside of this and again just looking at what we've got here look at that situation right there are lots of thick-cut smoked brisket action right there and of course the mac and cheese goodness to go with it's definitely got some height to it a little on the small side in terms of the diameter but the height is really really good on this so let's give this one a shot but real quick in like always if you guys are fans of high quality delicious looking food reviews make sure to hit that subscribe button down below and don't forget to tap that Bell icon so you could be notified as soon as brand-new content drops every week guys the brisket double cheese sandwich here I think he's barbecue pit let's do it oh that is thick the mac and cheese is thick hmm man that is banging well obviously as you saw right off the break the thickness of that mac and cheese is coming through amazing right now and then you get the nice smoked flavor of the brisket very tender but guys this is very very dense take a look on the inside there naturally with the cheese on the bottom that is pretty much the place holder to keep all the meat in place and it's actually a very good thing but man this is very gluttonous very delicious let's keep going with it I'm diggin it already though it's good mmm super gluttonous super wet super flavorful and honestly when I first saw this I was thinking okay this does look really really awesome but I was worried about the amount of mac & cheese that was gonna be on the inside of this naturally it's all across the top of it and naturally a very decent amount of meat on the inside so while it's not a very very big sandwich overall because the diameter of it is a little on the small side it's got some height even though I've got it kind of crushed down over here but man the flavorfulness of that meat is amazing the brisket is banging on this it really is and I think I probably could have benefited from a brisket sandwich diaper on this one because there's a lot coming out the back of this here so I'm gonna try and do this carefully but we want to go in on some of that barbecue sauce naturally there is a reason why they give it to you here so let me try and give this a shot very carefully hopefully that's coming through there we go we'll try it on just that bite right over there but I am already diggin the smell of that barbecue sauce already guys it feels kind of sweet kind of smoky already in the car it's pretty strong let's do it oh my god oh my god oh yes sweet smoky kind of Mesquite and flavor and I got to say that adds immediate flavor to the already flavorfulness of the brisket itself and then of course the denseness of that mac and cheese the cheddar goodness this is just a very gluttonous sandwich very homestyle very comfort food and it really satisfies all the boxes on what a really gluttonous type of barbecue sandwich would have with just mac and cheese and brisket that's really all you really need with this even without that barbecue sauce it would still be amazing but if you want it's a little bit of an extra flavor boost to it there that's really a nice add-on but guys this is just deliciously crazy let me show you one more time here lots of mac and cheese don't let the top of it fool you it is very thick and it is all up in there and then naturally with the thickness of the brisket we carefully bring this around to very wet sandwich a very lovely situation this is a high watermark for a type of sandwich like this over at Dickey's because it combines what they do very well into a very lovely package so a delicious situation we're gonna go for one more bite with this one I'll give you another close-up because you've got plenty of them up to this point you can never not see enough of this sandwich I'm telling you right now and then we'll finish this one out after the rating hang up alright I know we just did a 360 but we're gonna go for another one guys because why not lots of delicious brisket on this one and of course the mac and cheese the cheddar on the very bottom is blending with everything so I can't really taste it too much because of how strong the mac and cheese is in general but as you can see guys a very wet sandwich a very delicious sandwich and it is absolutely legit barbecue over here at Dickey's with this one really really good yesir some delicious comfort food goodness on the inside of that sandwich for sure so overall I'm gonna have to give the brisket double cheese sandwich here at Dickey's Barbecue Pit a rock-solid 9 out of 10 the only thing really keeping this one away from the top spot technically even though it really is a 10 out of 10 in flavor is the size of it naturally I'm gonna have just a little bit larger in terms of just the diameter to match the thickness considering the price point I don't think it's too much to ask get almost $8 for this naturally I think it would have been benefited by maybe just a little bit of a larger size but overall guys it's got some height and the flavor absolutely matches so is it worth your time absolutely a 9 out of 10 is easily worth your time and that one easily satisfies very delicious ok now the obvious question did this one look pretty delicious to you right now do me a quick favor drop some comments down below
