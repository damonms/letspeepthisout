 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty well it looks like Taco Bell's latest promo aims to be a little bit more familiar this time out and that's not necessarily a bad thing considering the value looks pretty high along with it being tweaked just a little bit and that tweaking I'm talking about is definitely in the protein options this time out guys feast your eyes on the grande nachos box and it's definitely a healthy looking portion of goodness here from Taco Bell starting off with the obvious we've got plenty of the nacho chips underneath topped off with a three cheese blend we've got a cheese sauce refried beans shredded chicken a double portion of that apparently we've got some pico de gallo we've got some guacamole and we've got some sour cream and I gotta say for five bucks not a bad deal with a drink and the drink of choice Mountain Dew Baja blasts zero sugar and I'm definitely diggin this medium cup it comes and although it does look a little on the thin side but tall really really cool looking they're really excited to get into this I think I know exactly how this is gonna taste it's pretty much the same as taco bell usually is with the exception of the shredded chicken being the protein of choice for this version let's give it a go it's the Grande nachos box here at Taco Bell with that mountain dew baja blast zero sugar let's peep

notified as soon as new content drops every week now let's dive into this one well there goes that classic sense of deja vu at Taco Bell once again this looks just like the steak nachos box that I reviewed last year and if you're curious about how that review was hit the link in the upper right hand corner of your display and you can check that one out exactly the same toppings minus the steak this time out with the shredded chicken so let's give this a go I think I know exactly how it's gonna go it's the Grande nachos box at Taco Bell with shredded chicken deja vu confirmed it's the same thing but tasty definitely diggin the refried beans along with the guacamole and that sour cream it's a nice combination and even the Pico is not too bad either guys I think my tolerance for tomatoes is going up just a little bit the shredded chicken is always pretty awesome I love the shredded chicken the mini quesadillas that they have here for like a buck it's the same exact meat there's a an amount of it here and not as much as I would like that's the only thing it's supposed to be like a double portion of meat that they say it's never really exactly like that for me this definitely looks a little anemic in that department but the flavors are on point mmm very tasty hey I don't know if it's just me but for some reason the shredded chicken here at Taco Bell kind of reminds me of tuna I'm getting like a tuna vibe for some reason it doesn't taste fishy like tuna but it's something about the consistency of it there's something about it that just reminds me of tuna I don't know why but I am digging this guys it actually is very familiar like I said the Taco Bell guacamole it's a combination of something that makes it guacamole I don't know it's definitely creamier it's probably got some other stuff in it naturally but the sour cream goes pretty nice it's everything you already love from Taco Bell for five bucks with a drink you really can't hate on it it's pretty tasty mmm and speaking of the drink this is gonna be my first time giving the mountain dew baja blast zero sugar a shot let's give this one a go that's actually really good zero sugar but it's got a hit very very sweet aftertaste that is really nice it's actually not as sweet as the regular Baja blast but I like this guy's yeah it's definitely lighter but it does have a nice sweet aftertaste to it nice combination to go with this as well really really tasty my only gripe with this though is if you take a look underneath it there's not really anything layered throughout this is pretty much just a bunch of chips with everything thrown on top it really would be nice if it had a little bit more of the cheese or maybe on the bottom or maybe towards the middle just to kind of mix it a bit because once you get through all the toppings again you're left with a lot of the regular chips here with nothing else to go with but fortunately this quantity that I have right now is pretty decent so as long as you're mixing it around that may actually help you in that department but it would be nice to have a little bit of a layer of cheese of something on the bottom just to kind of give you something to look forward to at least a scoop up at the end right let me grab one more this is only minutes old and these chips are already getting kind of soggy which I don't understand that whatsoever but it is good it's very messy and guys it's Taco Bell you know what the ingredients are you know what the flavors are you know what to look forward to and like I said not a bad deal for five bucks with a drink tasty let me give you a closing shot of everything this one has to offer on one chip guys it's probably the most shredded chicken I have one ship compared to what spread out throughout here and I don't know about a double portion but it is decent at least I do have to admit I do like the portion size of everything here and again I do also wish that they actually had more of it on the very bottom just to make up for the fact of all the other naked ships that really need it what I would recommend you guys do like I need to tell you guys how to eat nachos just mix up everything on the bottom just a little bit with everything on the top so you can really get a nice coating but as it stands very decent and again for five bucks with a drink not a bad deal really fun late-night food if anything well that was pretty much what I expected it to be all the classic flavors of Taco Bell on top of their chips naturally there with your choice of either shredded chicken or beef and you can actually upgrade to the regular steak that I reviewed from last year as well for like a dollar more if you want to go that route I can give a lot to look forward to it's exactly the same type of thing but I have to admit the highlight for this one aside from the nachos was definitely this I really dug this drink guys the mountain dew baja blast zero sugar just the right amount of sweetness with zero calories I'm definitely gonna be getting this again it's really tasty mmm really really good so overall I'm gonna have to give the Grande nachos box here at Taco Bell just a decent 7.5 out of 10 and I can't really go much higher than that for obvious reasons guys this is all the same familiar taco bell flavors it's just the latest five dollar promo with a pretty decent beverage to go with naturally you have other choices but I would recommend giving that one a shot if you don't get the regular one easy recommendation and like I said great late night food especially if you're in the snacky mood guys cuz the quantity is decent just mix everything around a bit mmm you know now that I think about it since we're at the end of this review right now I guess this video is considered a public service announcement considering I've already done the steak nachos from last year this is pretty much the same thing just with a different protein so if you're gonna give this one a shot what's your personal preference shredded chicken ground beef or steak and are you gonna be given that mountain dew baja blast zero sugar a shot drop those comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K closing out another episode of peep this out bringing you brand-new content every single week here on my channel so while you stay tuned for the next review coming real soon in the meantime stay frosty hey there's nothing wrong with deja vu as long as you're a fan of what this one offers anyway right alright everyone until next time I'll talk to you soon
