this out it's flavor lit by fire over here at carl's jr as we go in and some 100% black angus beef as featured in their steakhouse angus thickburger and as you guys can see this is actually not bad looking here guys starting off with that really really nice soft looking bun on the top there let's pop it and take a look underneath it looks like we've got some name brand a1 steak sauce plenty of it there we've got some strips of bacon looks like a slice of swiss cheese and that's all on top of a third pound patty there guys 100% black angus beef goodness underneath that we've got some raw red onions some tomato and a little bit of mayo on the bottom there and actually some seasoning it looks like on top of the tomatoes there a little bit of an extra shake shake so definitely looking pretty nice and it smells really really fresh and it's very very hot right now but again really digging the amount of that a1 steak sauce here guys let's see if the flavor is going to deliver on this one it sure looks pretty good it's the all new steakhouse angus thickburger here at carl's jr let's peep out this flavor yeah that a1 is definitely strong and there's absolutely some extra seasoning on this as well guys so i'm very very excited to give this one a go but real quick before i do and like always if you guys are fans of high quality delicious looking food reviews make sure to hit that

that first bite this is looking really really good even with the tomato on the bottom believe it or not everything is really colorful on this one looking solid here we go it's the steakhouse angus thickburger brand new here at carl's jr whoa right off the break this one is pretty flavor packed guys obviously the name brand a1 steak sauce is sticking out ridiculously awesome in the very beginning of this one on top of the extra seasoning there's definitely extra seasoning that's been shaken onto the beef here and i gotta say it's a lovely situation after that a little bit of the cheese nothing too crazy it's creamy and then the smokiness of the bacon so far let's keep going this is actually really really tasty and again i think the steakhouse name really fits this burger considering not just the sauce but just the overall feeling of what it's got going on here with right now let's keep doing it all right so a show of hands who likes smoky bacon on the top of their burger probably pretty much everybody right i mean if you're watching this right now chances are you're pretty interested in what this one has to offer and what this one does offer is some pretty awesome flavor in that a1 steak sauce department on top of the black angus beef you can really taste that 100% beef goodness right there guys it is really really solid and just overall everything else so far is really swinging with it nice and flavorful absolutely and hey the good thing about the quality of the a1 steak sauce on this is i'm not really tasting the tomato very much at all which is really awesome so a little bit of the crunch of the onion is there and absolutely the overall quality of those veggies on top of everything that i'm dealing with right now and i'm only saying dealing with because guys i'm really enduring the heat at the moment i gotta be honest it's very very crispy in the car at the moment here but guys the quality is pretty solid and hey it really helps if this one is ultra flavorful and the addition of that bacon on top of it is a major plus you gotta have bacon on a cheeseburger especially carl's jr it's very rare that they don't have bacon on their promo burgers right let's keep going in yeah really really good and as i'm getting further into this right now i'm noticing that the beef itself is not ultra juicy because all the moisture from all the other condiments on this are really picking up the slack here a little bit of the mayo at the very end is kind of coming up there too and even though the mayo is not really my thing the a1 steak sauce definitely is so that combination of the two together is a very lovely situation but i gotta say in the back of my mind while i'm eating this right now while i am digging the red onion i'm definitely digging the crunch the snap and everything that they add the overall flavor is good you can really taste the onions on this i'm really missing the fact that they're not fried now granted the bk steakhouse king which i reviewed a while back which i mentioned at the top of the review during the drive-thru sequence that was pretty tasty when i checked it out about three years ago so i like the fact that this is a variant using the official a1 steak sauce they're really advertising it heavy with this but i gotta say i'm really missing the crispy fried onions that this one i think should have now granted they're going for more of an upper scale feel with this one i have a feeling having the red onion visible there color wise it's beautiful but crispy onions i think would have gone a long way on top of the a1 steak sauce that this is pretty much drenched with which i'm really digging guys like i said it's really good so one more quick bite of this one we'll finish it up after the rating but it's a very delicious burger and of course it's the classic black angus beef over here at carl's jr that they do very well with some name brand condiments on the top so one more bite and we'll finish this one out all right so let's do a little 360 action here without the burger diaper which i'm very glad that it has by the way because this one is really kind of leaking out the back but as you can see a very thick third pound patty over here of black angus beef a lovely situation and just overall a very nice steakhouse themed burger with some name brand condiments on the top that a1 steak sauce really is a nice touch it's good for advertising and obviously the flavor is awesome lovely situation especially with the bacon on this one all right guys this one's gonna be pretty easy to score on that scale of 1 to 10 i'm going to have to give the steakhouse angus thickburger here at carl's jr a pretty rock solid 9 out of 10 the only way to improve this one and i think you know what's coming is take out those red onions and make them crispy coat them in some really delicious batter because i'm telling you the extra seasoning that shakeable seasoning that you saw on the inside of that on top of the a1 steak sauce that combination would have been just amazing but as it stands it really is a delicious burger as it is and the main highlight of that one on top of the black angus beef is easily going to be the a1 steak sauce so guys you have a lot to look forward to with this one if you decide to give it a go and like i said it's perfectly suited for the season even as summer's winding down pretty delicious stuff all right so now the obvious question are you going to be giving this one a shot do me a quick favor drop some comments down below let me know what
