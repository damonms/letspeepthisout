 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty hey everyone welcome back to another high quality  foodie feature for you here on the channel   cheaters cam style after hours to complete  the trifecta here at good old mickey d's   by going in on the final selection off  of their all-new chicken sandwich menu   and by the looks of it i think we're about to  get a little fancy with this one so without   further ado here we go with the all new deluxe  crispy chicken sandwich and as usual we've got   that familiar potato roll action guys looking nice  and shiny let's pop it and take a look underneath   and as you can see we've got a fairly decent  portion of mayo on this one here along with some   shredded lettuce but guys take a look at one of  the roma tomatoes there as we pan down and take   a look at the chicken we've got a total of three  sliced roma tomatoes here on top of that southern   style fried chicken action i gotta say this is  actually not looking too bad it's definitely   looking nice and crispy and with nothing else to  be had on the bottom guys this is still looking   really really nice if not just a little bit fancy  and i'm only saying that because the roma tomatoes   definitely add a little bit more elegance when  it comes to food and i have to admit this is   definitely making the sandwich look pretty nice  so i thought i'd kind of dress up for the occasion   being that hopefully i may have saved the best  for last because this really does look really good   so let me hopefully confirm the goodness  in this one for you right now guys this   is the all new deluxe crispy chicken  sandwich here at mcdonald's let's do it all right first off as most of you probably  know mayo is not really my thing but to be   honest guys neither are tomatoes and i'm  actually liking the roma tomatoes on this   particular one the juiciness of the chicken  is combining with everything beautifully   and the combination works along with the softness  of that potato roll pretty banging already and   being that i got all the ingredients in that first  shot guys right with that first bite let me take a   look on the inside with you just real quick here  before i take the second bite so you can see it   a lovely situation on that chicken patty guys  take a look at that there fairly sizable and   this one is easily one of the best that i've  had so far a definite lovely situation there   lots of mayo i'm not really minding it as much  because of everything else in here but guys the   flavorfulness of that chicken is banging this  is really pretty good let's go for another bite mmm juicy you know there's something about these  roma tomatoes that are really elevating this   one up just a bit guys i'm not really getting  that nasty tomato flavor that i really don't   like it's not really like the same type of  tomato flavor that i'm getting with this   but everything else with that chicken is the  center point right now because that fillet   is really beautifully done just the right  amount of coating not too much in terms of   breading on this one so you can really taste  the white meat and guys the quality of the   white meat is pretty good before i go in again  let me just keep showing it to you not bad guys   not bad whatsoever here and that potato roll is  really setting it off and the crispiness of the   coating is a lovely situation i'm just glad this  chicken filet is actually filling out the roll   and this really looks like it feels like it's  worth it i should say for five bucks it's not bad   and you know what the more i'm thinking about it  the more i'm beginning to realize these are not   really going after popeyes necessarily this is  much closer to chick-fil-a actually because of   the shape of the chicken itself it looks very  similar and honestly because of the consistency   of the chicken that i've been getting lately which  has been kind of up and down with my last couple   of reviews take a look at them popping up on  your screen right now if you haven't checked   those out already a nice combo of goodness for  you guys to watch this is actually a very very   nice solid piece of chicken here right now  so this feels like one of the better days of   chick-fil-a when it comes to the size of the  chicken here so definitely a lovely situation   all right so let's go for one more bite of this  one because being that this is technically part   three in the series of the chicken sandwiches  that I've reviewed here at mcdonald's i pretty   much know what to expect after the first one  naturally minus the topping changes naturally   as well but guys a very lovely situation with  this and again i'm very surprised that the roma   tomatoes believe it or not are taking this one  to a level i didn't think it was gonna go being   that i don't really like tomato but guys a lovely  situation one more bite and we'll finish this one up well as you can probably tell right now i'm  definitely digging this particular one out of the   three so far guys and considering my quote unquote  love for tomatoes that's very surprising but again   the main showpiece of the chicken itself is  really selling this one here guys as you can see   i'm assuming it's about 80% meat 20% coating but  when you bite into it it's a nice solid piece   of white meat that's fairly juicy and the  coating is not too overly salted this time   that last one that i had the spicy version was a  little more salty this is absolutely a step in the   right direction definitely made very well well  i still believe the consistency may be a small   issue here and there depending upon some of the  locations that you may go to but generally you   should have a pretty decent experience because  so far it's been getting a little bit better   as i've gone being that this is the topper  right now the quote-unquote fancy version   the deluxe is definitely up there guys and the  quality overall really speaks for itself just a   really delicious chicken sandwich over here at  mickey d's so with that said i'm gonna have to   give the all-new deluxe crispy chicken sandwich  here at mcdonald's a pretty rock solid   8.5 out of 10 i guess i really did save the  best for last because that literally is the best   version out of the three i'm probably going to be  getting that one again and like i said the quality   speaks for itself those roma tomatoes again  there's something about them that really elevated   the overall flavor profile of the chicken itself  with that outer coating again with it not being   too salty this time out it really worked extremely  well and again the softness of that potato roll a   lovely situation but again i'm gonna come back  to the nitpick if it's a real potato roll and a   little bit more flour dusting on the top just  to make it just a little bit more authentic   you're already going fancy with the roma tomatoes  i think you should upscale the bun to match that   just saying okay so being that we've come to the  end of the trifecta of these intro sandwiches here   at mcdonald's i have no doubt we'll probably  see some other versions down the road out of   the three reviews that you've probably watched  already with this what is your personal favorite   drop some comments down below are you personally  looking forward to giving any particular one   a shot drop those comments down below again and  definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K  closing out another high quality foodie feature  for you here on peep this out reviews cheaters
