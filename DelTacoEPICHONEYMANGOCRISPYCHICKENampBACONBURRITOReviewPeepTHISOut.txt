 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty hey everyone welcome back to another high quality  foodie feature for you here on the channel   cheaters cam style after hours once again over  at del taco to sample another selection off of   their all-new honey mango menu and considering the  title to this one you know exactly what's about   to go down guys feast your eyes on their all-new  epic honey mango crispy chicken and bacon burrito   a mouthful of a title but guys take a look at this  thing this thing is looking absolutely packed with   the goodness here so let's start off with the  laundry list of ingredients that includes an   oversized warm flour tortilla packed to the gills  with crispy chicken strips crispy bacon crinkle   cut fries cheddar cheese sour cream and honey  mango sauce and i to say guys this is looking   pretty awesome and considering how packed this one  looks i think that's an understatement guys this   thing is looking really really nice and honestly  i am really digging the heft even with this half   that i have cut in my hands right now i can't wait  to get into this so let's peep out the flavor on   this one it's the all new epic honey mango crispy  chicken and bacon burrito here at del taco and   man this is a mouthful let me see if i can get  my mouth around this one right now here we go that is thick oh man but good right off the break  the denseness of those crispy chicken strips along   with the honey mango sauce light this one up big  time and then you get the nice extra denseness   coming from the crinkle cut fries i got to admit  guys it's a very hearty bite and then a little   bit of the smokiness of the bacon coming through  not really tasting any sour cream just yet but   guys it is a showcase of girth and take a look at  this again this is absolutely packed with the good   stuff on the inside you can see the sour cream  is kind of beginning to congeal just a little bit   it's definitely warm and i'm really digging the  overall flavor of this guys let's keep going in oh yeah man i think del taco knows what  they're doing with this one because the sour   cream lights up the honey mango even more so  guys it gives a little bit more of a sour edge   naturally but a little bit more creaminess on  top of it and then when you add that in with   the crinkle cut fries adding the extra girth to  this one and the chicken and the smokiness of   the bacon and the grated cheddar cheese you  kind of see where i'm going with this one   there's a lot going on but it is epic for a  reason and the name absolutely works with this one   absolutely digging this already  let's keep going in i'm digging it you know i gotta say on the real i'm so glad  that i actually checked out the crispy chicken   taco version of this first before jumping into  this which if you haven't seen that review it's   popping up on your screen here right now spoiler  alert that was a beautiful situation just to   sample the honey mango sauce on its own to see  exactly how the richness was gonna be if it was   gonna be overly sweet and i gotta say guys i'm so  glad that i did that because now with this it's   more of the accent to everything else going on  in here now granted this is a very busy burrito   the epic burritos tend to be over here at  del taco but believe it or not that sauce   is still standing out beautifully in addition  to all the flavors of everything else and guys   i'm just digging the fact that this is just  so thick right now it's very hearty to jump into   but let me continue to do just that by  going in and a couple of more bites on   this one but guys a super fun thing to check  out especially late night as it usually is   here in the cheaters cam edition of peep this out  reviews absolutely digging it let's keep going in you know with every bite of this i have to keep  giving you the mmm sounds because the mouth feel   is so awesome on this it's so hearty to dive into  and just biting down is very satisfying because   you're getting everything in here especially  now that i'm in the really middle portion of   it really everything is beginning to stand out  even further so guys an easy recommendation if   you have del taco in the area and if you're a fan  of sweet i'm telling you this is actually nicely   done i don't have an overabundance of the honey  mango sauce on this one it's perfect and it goes   amazing with everything on the inside so let's  go for one more bite of this one and we'll wrap   this one up after the rating but guys another  super fun review to check out super late night   here especially from dell taco this is very well  done let's go for it well on the real i gotta say   i'm not really a super fan of french fries on the  inside of burritos and while it's just okay for me   in that department everything else here is really  singing with it guys i mean it is a carb overload   as you can see along with those french fries and  the outer coating of the chicken but the chicken   is fairly juicy it's nice and crispy and it's  absolutely one of the signatures over here at del   taco with this promo add in the sour cream and the  honey mango goodness that combination is beautiful   along with the meltiness of that grated  cheddar cheese guys that's a lovely situation   and of course to finish it out we've got that nice  warm tortilla so a lovely situation guys indeed   all right so let's just jump right to it score  wise with everything you've seen and heard me talk   about on this review right now i'm gonna have to  give the all-new epic honey mango crispy chicken   and bacon burrito a mouthful of a title for easily  a mouthful of a burrito a pretty rock solid   9 out of 10 like i said earlier fries are not really  my thing on the inside of burritos like this   and while it does add the overall girth that i'm  biting into everything else thankfully aside from   that really stood out the honey mango sauce was  beautiful just the right amount and the smokiness   of the bacon and the sourness of that sour cream  together everything guys a beautiful situation   and of course let's not forget about the crispy  chicken three large pieces on the inside of that   and overall it delivered it absolutely delivered  big time all right so i've got one simple question   for you are you a fan of fries on the inside  of a burrito is that like one of the things   that you like on the inside of your burritos when  you get them drop those comments down below and   definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K  closing out another high quality foodie feature   for you here on peep this out reviews cheaters cam  style after hours bringing you brand new content   every single week here on my channel so while
