 what's going on everyone and welcome back to  another high quality foodie feature for you   here on the channel where this time i'm over  at mcdonald's to check out the return of a   true holiday fan favorite menu item that's right  and as you already know it's the return of the   holiday pie so stay tuned because it's up next  to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty all right it's the moment i've been waiting  all year for besides the return of the mcrib   guys feast your eyes on the holiday pie here at  mcdonald's another awesome situation of baked   goodness this is just looking pretty fantastic  here what we've got here is a sugar cookie crust   filled with vanilla custard topped off with some  really nice festive sprinkles as you can see there   and then bake that beautifully and i'm going to  actually just break this towards you right now   just to get it going well not so much of an even  break but there you go a very lovely situation in   terms of the custard on the inside of this guys  this is just looking really nice it's very warm   in my hands right now this is literally minutes  old so since i've got the smaller piece ready to   go here let's just do that real quick definitely a  seasonal favorite a fan favorite holiday menu item   over here let's give it a go guys it's the return  of the holiday pie here at mcdonald's let's do it buttery sugar cookie goodness right away vanilla  cream oh man i am going to be getting these all   throughout the season this is really good well  consider this another one of these holiday   quickies that i'm doing guys and with the return  of this on the menu over here like i said it's a   very popular item i believe i checked this one out  about four years ago initially and it was done at   night i believe as a cheater's cam review and  i definitely wanted to come on by and give this a   go i've actually had it every season since and  there's a reason for it guys because the sugar   cookie goodness is ultra buttery especially if you  can get it super fresh out of the oven like this   and with that vanilla cream on the inside how  could you fade that how could you go wrong with it   very very lovely overall and i gotta say the  flavor is just crazy not too sweet but the vanilla   is very pronounced and it's actually very very  nice that it's baked too which is really awesome   a little bit of the granules of sugar on the very  top of this as you can see with the sprinkles   really really nice guys this is  really tasty let's go for another bite i'm making this last piece count for the review  too wow this is so tasty right now and just so you   guys know in the app you can get a free cookie or  pie with a minimum of a dollar purchase so grab a   large diet coke or large soda or something and  you get one of these for free right now that's   pretty awesome again just going to keep showing  it to you i really love the outer crust on this   the overall quality like i said it's a fast food  pie but it's so decadent so rich so flavorful and   the sugar level is not bad whatsoever on this  one more bite we'll close this review out guys   but i'm so glad this is back and on its own for 99  cents you can fade that here we go one last bite yes sir a real guilty pleasure aside from the  pumpkin and cream pie over here that's also my   favorite besides this one and i'm telling you  guys this is the time of the season for all the   good stuff over here nothing against the apple  pies over here at mcdonald's it's all about the   seasonal goodness so if you have something  like this and you have the pumpkin as well   if they still have those left a nice one-two  punch combo you've got a lovely situation   just beautiful butteriness and overall a very very  solid vanilla flavor as well i'm so glad it's back   all right so i didn't check out my first review  before coming to do this one but i ventured i   guess it was probably like in the 7.5 and 8 range if i'm not mistaken and   i'm not going to go much higher than an 8 for  this because like i said pumpkin is pretty much   up there as well in terms of flavor for me and i  think i kind of prefer that just a little bit more   but with the flavor of this one being so on point  with the vanilla custard being as creamy as it is   it's very close behind guys so overall i'm gonna  have to give the returning holiday pie here at   mcdonald's for the holiday 2021 season a very  solid 8 out of 10 solid goodness and i gotta   say again a beautiful situation especially if you  can get it fresh out of the oven i would highly   recommend it very very solid all right so i've  got one simple question for you because if you've   made it this far into the review i'd venture to  guess you were into the holiday pie just like   i am over here at mcdonald's how important is this  particular one in terms of all the pies they have   throughout the year is this like your ultimate  favorite drop those comments down below and   definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K  closing out another high quality foodie feature   for you here on peep this out reviews bringing  you brand new content every single week here on   my channel so while you stay tuned for that next  review coming real soon in the meantime stay   frosty oh how sweet it is well maybe it's not  ultra sweet but you
