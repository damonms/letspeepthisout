 hey everyone I'm back at it this time over a jack-in-the-box because it looks like they've got some new stuff poppin as in popcorn chicken so stay tuned because it's up next welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty so let's get it on and poppin here a jack-in-the-box with their all-new spicy popcorn chicken combo and initial first impressions a little on the light side for the price guys $5.99 in my neck of the woods here in Southern Cali what we've got here is a side of fries we've got the drink to go with and for the main event itself on the inside of this box which does look pretty cool actually is that spicy popcorn chicken but it's very very small as you can see here let's take a look underneath and see what we're working with obviously as expected it's that fried goodness looks like we have got some white meat chicken that is actually breaded up and fried to a crispy golden-brown and then it's actually laced up with some buffalo sauce for the heat that's where the heats coming from here for the spicy variant but guys decent for what this is as you can see they do have a plentiful amount on the inside of here but again it's very very small for the container itself that's my only real gripe so far so I'm really hoping the flavors gonna deliver with this one for dipping of course the buttermilk ranch is what it comes with standard it's one of my favorites anyway but let's see if this one's gonna deliver overall it's the spicy popcorn chicken combo here at jack-in-the-box let's peep out this flavor yeah this def that looks a little on the small side and you can really see it with the size of the container in my hand right now guys so for 6 bucks I'm really hoping the flavor is gonna pop on this one pun intended let's take a look at this one up close real quick again for you as you can see crispy golden fried with a little tinge of orange there for Buffalo here we go it's the spicy popcorn chicken here at jack-in-the-box standard nugget it's okay a little bit of sizzle nothing crazy it's got a pretty nice residual burn that's actually still hanging with me right now so that's not bad and as you can see again nice and crispy the white meat is pretty solid as well pretty impressed with that fairly juicy believe it or not too so this is one of the larger pieces of the popcorn chicken here but so far just a standard nugget nothing crazy but it's tasty the coating has almost like a creaminess to it which I kind of like and in that heat that continues on with it as well and again the white meat at least in this initial piece there's a lot of little ones that I have here is pretty nice hmm okay let's go for a dip in some of their popular ranch here this is my all-time favorite I can't imagine this being bad really I mean a standard nugget you kind of know what to expect a little bit of heat and it's just Jack's version of it which is kind of nice and of course with a nice creaminess of that ranch action right there I have a feeling this is gonna be pretty good let's grab one of these again and give this a shot this one looks a little overly fried actually here guys take a look at that let's give it a shot with the ranch the spicy popcorn chicken I'm expecting it to be a little cooler here we go and it is actually a nice the creaminess of the batter believe it or not it has like a creaminess to it I can't describe it more than that along with that creamy ranch that's a very full-featured flavor profile definitely digging that hmm not bad that's definitely saving this one flavor wise but value wise I don't really know oh my god let me pull this up here for you real fast this is pretty big popcorn chicken that's more like half of a chicken strip right there guys I don't know about this being popcorn but I'm digging it right now because let's just go for it again I'm gonna take you close up with this one keep that focus in but man this is what I'm talking about here I kind of like this Buffalo on its own I think this might be better with regular chicken strips as opposed to just the popcorn bits here I see what they're going for for it let's give it a shot mmm that's a hearty bite wow that is a lovely situation mmm look at that a lot of orange in this one here let me pull out of the focus here so you can see it focus is crazy today but as you can see the seasoned goodness there a little bit of that pepper flow in there as well too it looks like on the outside but I'm really diggin the nice thick juiciness of his white meat guys I have to admit this is pretty nice I've got about two or three pieces like this in there and the rest of them are like these little tiny popcorn pieces what you'd expect to find but I'm really liking the ranch I think this is definitely the way to go obviously it's the perfect dipping sauce in my opinion for chicken strips but guys pretty tasty mm-hmm well after those two or pieces this is all I've got left in this container guys so your mileage may vary in terms of what you think of this in terms of value for me I think it's a little on the higher side in terms of the price point I wouldn't go much above $3.99 for something like this but naturally what you're getting is a pretty tasty piece of popcorn chicken action here with some really nice crispy crust that has a creaminess to it and of course if you go for the spicy that's definitely the way to go in my opinion it really goes nice with that ranch you know considering how they were upselling a bigger version of this for $7.99 for double the amount of the chicken I'm almost thinking I should have gone that route had I known what the size was gonna be like with the initial portion that I got because like I said 6 bucks you're expecting just a little bit more for the money and the quality of the chicken is actually pretty tasty I just wish like I said there was a little more variation in terms of some of the size there after those two are so pieces that I had that I showed you it's two really really very very tiny pieces overall so again the flavor is decent the heat is solid but that initial asking price for the basic combo is the real sticking point for me with this one so with that said I'm gonna have to give the spicy popcorn chicken combo here at jack-in-the-box just an OK 5.5 out of 10 it does deliver on flavor don't get me wrong it is pretty tasty but your mileage may vary depending upon where you pick this one up like I said the ranch goes amazingly well with it as well I mean how bad could it really be with ranch and fried chicken pieces guys that's like a classic anyway I only wish there was just a little bit more of it to go around at least for the initial asking price of that basic combo but what do you guys personally think drop some comments down below are you a fan of popcorn chicken in general or maybe just a regular chicken strips which do you think satisfies you the most drop those comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K closing out another episode of peep this out bringing you brand new content every single week here on my channel so while you stay tuned for that next review coming real soon in the
