 what's going on everyone and welcome back to  another high quality foodie feature for you here   on the channel where this time i've returned to  domino's because after checking out some pretty   awesome stuffed cheesy bread action last week i  thought i'd go in on something that looked equally   as tasty if not sweeter and you already know what  it is feast your eyes on there cinnamon bread   twists and i gotta say the presentation is very  inviting on this one guys what you're looking at   is an eight piece order of freshly baked buttery  dough and i gotta say nice and golden on each of   those pieces there drizzled with cinnamon and  sugar and obviously a very decent amount of it   across the board here looking pretty lovely and  for dipping obviously we're going in on some sweet   icing and while i did expect there to be some form  of dipping sauce here i have to admit with the   amount of drizzle that this one has on it guys i  don't even really think it needs it but even still   i'm definitely digging the presentation so  there you go it's the cinnamon bread twists   here at domino's let's peep out this flavor all  right looks like i got to be careful with this   one because this is actually leaking through  the bottom of the container there is a lot of   cinnamon a lot of sugar on this guys but again  the presentation is looking very killer on this   so i've got this perched in front of me here  right now got my microphone dead center as well   this is very very hot in the car right now on  top of it wow nice and gooey on this one here   take a look at that guys these are puffed up  pretty nicely plenty of cinnamon and sugar   all that goodness on the top of it here all around  actually let's not waste any more time guys it's   the all-new cinnamon twist new for me first time  trying it let's give it a shot here at domino's fresh baked bread you can't fade it strong  cinnamon strong sugar that's nice well i got to   say the fact that it's over 100 degrees outside my  car here right now you can only imagine what it's   like on the inside with the fan blowing but even  still guys it's keeping these suckers nice and   toasty nice and warm and as you can see the fresh  baked goodness very puffy on the inside plenty of   that cinnamon glaze the sugar on top of it as well  a very lovely situation guys the flavor is exactly   as you'd expect it to be almost kind of like  cinnabon believe it or not because i'm getting   that flavor it's really the essence of it and i  gotta say i am digging this already and real quick   let me send a huge shout out to all the other food  reviewers in the community right now because if   you do food reviews in the car you obviously  know having a stack of napkins is a necessity   especially with situations like this where the box  is soaked on the bottom whatever you're reviewing   you want to make sure you have something prepared  and guys i'm glad that i am prepared right now   but even still let me give you one more shot  of this because i want to give you as much   glory shots as i can while it is burning up like  crazy right now on my car let's keep going in i am so digging that it's so basic but the  flavor is awesome and again there is no   shortage of the cinnamon and sugar combination  they have on here right now the glaze is real on   this here let me just kind of scoop some on the  bottom just so you guys can kind of see it here   there is a lot to go around but obviously the  duality of the dough and of course the darkness   that you're seeing of that glaze again it's  kind of reminding me of cinnabon because it's   really scratching the itch for that right now but  there is just so much of the goodness here i'm   really digging it let's go for a couple more bites  we'll get into some icing this is pretty banging oh yeah easily worth the $5.99 for the eight piece  on this easy really good you know and even as i'm   looking down at this right now there was just  so much of the glaze on here like i mentioned   during the initial close-up of this one even  if this didn't come with the icing that we're   about to get into right now i would still be  okay with it because there is so much of the   glaze on here guys and again it is definitely  plentiful right there really really nice just   the right amount of sweetness it's elevated but  it goes amazing with the fresh baked bread the   buttery goodness is pretty banging one more  bite then we'll get into some icing hang on definitely a banging sweet treat already all right  guys it's all about that sweet icing goodness here   let's give this a shot we'll crack this open this  feels like it is filled pretty much the top here   let me open this up and see if it actually is  and well almost i'll give you guys the look here   first so you can see it it is pretty much towards  the top but there's plenty of it over here guys   oh wow that smell is pretty nice as well too here  let me grab a little guy here only because we can   give you a better view of what this is going  to look like here there you go take a look at   that icy goodness all in effect nice and gooey  let's give this a shot real fast with the icing   as soon as i hit my tongue right  away banging sweetness on this wow   whole new level of flavor oh my god really good   and because this nug is not going to satisfy let's  pick up the big gun right over here at the end   let me lift this up here and we'll get a lot of  that icing first let me give you guys some shots   of this here this is a puffed out sucker take  a look at that right there guys delicious stuff   barely gets into it here we go oh gooey gooey  goodness right there guys gooey goodness here   we go this is going to be the bite right now the  cinnamon twists with the icing together here we go soft pillowy goodness oh my god amazing  pairing i take back everything i said earlier   you need the icing to go with this you really  do wow i am just leaning back in the cut right   now guys considering the heat outside it's  hot in my car right now as i'm filming this   and i'm having something ultra sweet on top of  that you think i would bring a drink right i   mean that's really what i should have done but i  didn't as usual and you guys are going to give me   for it in the comment section i'm sure but  as you can see a lovely situation on this just   delicious stuff all around and i am so glad to be  giving this a shot right now for you very tasty oh yeah so let me just go for one more dip  on this one as we round it out guys a very   lovely situation for those of you who are fans  of cinnamon in general cinnabon in general you   have a domino's close by this is an amazing  situation i would easily recommend this to   you $5.99 a banging value it's ultra fresh ultra  sweet and i gotta say ultra satisfying especially   with the icing delicious stuff so jumping right  to it i'm gonna have to give the cinnamon bread   twists here at domino's an awesome 9 out of  10 the only thing that i can see that really   takes this one back just a little bit is maybe  the size of the individual pieces some were a   little bit larger which i preferred some were  a little on the smaller side but even still   what you're getting is fresh baked bread drizzled  nicely with the cinnamon and sugar and guys like   i said in the beginning i thought you weren't  gonna need the icing because the flavor of the   cinnamon and the sugar was pretty amazing anyway  but once you pair it up with that sweet icing   instant overload of flavor truly delicious stuff  and like i said worth that $5.99 easy all right   so as for the questions for those of you with  dominos in the area how often have you gotten   these cinnamon bread twists in the past and if  you've had them in the past if not more recently   what did you personally think of them is 9 out  of 10 pretty much agreeable for you drop those   comments down below and definitely let me know and  with that this is Ian K closing out another high   quality foodie feature for you here on peep this  out reviews bringing you brand new content every   single week here on my channel so while you stay tuned for  that next review coming real soon in the meantime   stay frosty i definitely dig the box the sim and  bread twist come in dominoe' but honestly between   you and me i'd probably consider using a different  type of liner instead of maybe paper this needs   something a little bit thicker just saying  alright guys until next time i'll talk to you soon   hey thanks for checking out another one of  my reviews but just in case you didn't see   the one before this one you can find it right  up over here along what i think youtube's going   to recommend for
