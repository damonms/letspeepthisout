 [Music] welcome to peep this out reviews with  Ian K stay frosty what's going on everyone   and welcome to the channel where today  I'm over at Papa John's to take a look   at their latest promo which as they put  it looks to flip pizza night on its head   and you know what with a saying like that I think  I can get behind it considering how tasty this   looks right now guys Feast your eyes on what I've  got here here we go with the deluxe cheese crispy   parm pizza and this is definitely looking pretty  crispy with plenty of cheese to boot as well let's   break this one on down for you real fast all  right so what you're looking at here is their   signature thin crust and in this case it's going  to be baked with a blend of shredded parmesan and   Romano cheese is right on the very bottom of  the crust itself so in addition to the cheesy   flavor you're going to get some added crunch  I'm thinking as well on the very top of course   we have The Usual Suspects we've got melted cheese  some light marinara and a swirl of alfredo sauce   for even more flavor guys so definitely a killer  combination there I'm thinking and because this   is Papa John's it comes with a nice side of their  special garlic dipping sauce one of my all-time   favorites if not the all-time favorite to go  into here this is pretty great and finishing this   one out we have a nice bit of garlic wash in the  outside portion of the Upper Crust so I definitely   can't wait to get into that as well so let's  not waste any more time on this one guys this   is the all new Deluxe cheese crispy parm pizza  here at Papa John's let's peep out this flavor   yes there are thin crust and toastiness guys this  is definitely lighting up my car beautifully aside   from keeping me nice and warm on a rainy day this  is looking and smelling pretty amazing so as I   always say pizza is always a challenge to film in  the car because of the size of the Box let me pull   up one of these slices and we'll get it going  and oh yeah some thin crust goodness guys this   is looking pretty great feast your eyes on the  bottom we've got a nice blend of that parmesan   and Romano cheese action toasted up beautifully  they spared no expense in making sure this was   covered nicely and this is very very awesome of  course we've got the cheese that Alfredo action   in there as well and the light butteriness that  I'm feeling on the very back of that thin crust   this is looking pretty great guys let's give  this a shot I'm a huge fan of cheese as you   guys know so I know this is going to be pretty  tasty I'm thinking anyway right let's hope so   this is the all new Deluxe cheese crispy parm  pizza here at Papa John's let's peep this out oh oh yeah vibrant on the bottom with that  parmesan and Romano it's crunchy oh wow that's tasty   first off the parmesan and that Romano cheese in  the bottom is a major highlight guys it's very   robust and I'm gonna keep showing this to you as  much as I can lots of toasted goodness right here   Crispy Crunchy and I gotta say the combination  of the cheese on here as well very very nice   the light marinara I'm not really getting any of  the Alfredo sauce just yet so let's keep going in   we're definitely going to get into that garlic  dipping sauce in just a minute there hang on   mmm oh there it is oh yeah well this is already  set up beautifully with all the cheese in the very   top but as soon as you buy it down you're going  to get some nice pungentness from that romano and   the parmesan action guys that is a loveliness  indeed and I have to say the combination of me   holding this crust in the very back is very nice  the thin crust really is but this really is very   tasty guys nice and crunchy nice and crispy  and a lot of flavor on this one here let's go   for another bite and we're definitely going to be  getting into some garlic sauce absolutely hang on mmm that's fun to eat too and FYI just so you guys  know if you decide to get this as is which is just   a regular Deluxe cheese you're definitely going to  be getting the Alfredo sauce and the garlic wash   on the outside but if you opt for one topping  there is no alfredo sauce and there's no garlic   wash on the outside based upon what I was told  so stick with the regular cheese because you're   going to be missing out on the Alfredo sauce and  that really is a nice highlight to go with this so   very very tasty and speaking of something nice to  go with it you already know what it is guys here   we go that Papa John's special garlic dipping  sauce action this stuff is crazy I think they   say to shake it up a little bit here I'm just  gonna go for it and open this up I don't know   if that really did anything but as you can  see it is very creamy I cannot wait to dip   into this which I'm going to do right now for  you here we go another shot more of the money   shots for you so crispy so crunchy and guys the  vibrancy of that parmesan and the Romano cheese   is strong on this so I can't see how this is  gonna be bad with the garlic because you know   it's going to be banging here so let's go into  it guys I'm so excited right now can you tell oh oh Man all day long all day and you know  what let's go for a little bit of that garlic   action in the very back because there's  a little bit of that garlic wash on this   and um yeah we got some more garlic  action to go with here let's keep going in you hear that crunch banging you know I'm so glad I opted to keep this as  is with the deluxe cheese version because I   originally wanted to order this with sausage so  once I was told you're going to be missing out   on the alfredo sauce from the garlic wash in the  back I decided you know what let's just keep it   the way that it is and definitely keep enjoying  it as it is as well here on the channel right now   so I'm gonna go for another cup on this one guys  this is crazy delicious and again I am totally   digging the crispiness on the bottom it almost  feels like a huge open face papadia because they   make them the same way and then they fold them  over and then cut them when those papadias are   done this way so naturally with something like  this it's pretty much like I said a huge open   face papadia but it's a pizza with some really  tasty cheese the romano and Parmesan action on   the bottom is just banging let's go for a couple  more on this mmm wow the combination of that   cheese and the Alfredo sauce along with the cheese  on the very bottom as well the two types guys the   romano and the parmesan Go amazing together so a  banging situation on this let's go for one more   bite we'll wrap the review with the raining  coming up next but a lovely combination and a   nice little hybrid upgrade considering this again  feels like a huge papadia just unfolded but it's   still pretty tasty let's go for one more bite and  we'll wrap this one up hang on love that crunch   yes sir a very lovely crispy situation on this one  guys that's only accentuated very nicely with the   parmesan and the Romano cheeses on the very bottom  and again while it does smack of a very large   papadia even still the combination is very very  nice the fact that it's open face like a regular   pizza again the cheeses are a nice combination the  garlic wash in the back as well as the Alfredo I'm   telling you stick with the cheese deluxe you're  gonna dig that combo it is really nice so with   that said I'm gonna have to give the deluxe cheese  crispy parm pizza here at Papa John's a rock solid   9 out of 10 guys the combination of all those  cheeses together the toastiness of it on top   of it goes amazingly well pairing that up with  the special garlic dipping sauce is a beautiful   situation but guys I have to say again all those  cheeses in the very bottom with that crunch add so   much to this pizza and again while it does feel  like a papadia just open faced it is delicious   nonetheless and the combination of the tartness  the tanginess and the overall crunch really goes   a long way it's definitely something to check out  especially if you're a cheese lover and if you've   made it this far into the review you most likely  are I'd highly recommend giving this one a go   all right so do me a quick favor drop those  comments down below let me know what you thought   of this particular one and were you getting those  papadia vibes along with me right now because like   I said the parmesan crusted action they've had in  the past along with the pepperoni crusted it's the   same basic concept it's just a much larger pizza  naturally with all that goodness baked right in but   what'd you personally think of this one drop those  comments down below and definitely let me know   and with that this is Ian K closing out  another high quality foodie feature for   you here on peep this out reviews bringing you  brand new content every single
