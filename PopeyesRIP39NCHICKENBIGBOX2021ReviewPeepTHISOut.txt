 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty hey everyone welcome back to another high quality  foodie feature for you here on the channel where   this time i'm over at popeye's because it looks  like what's old is new again and to start off the   new year popeyes is bringing back their rip'n  chicken only this time it's part of a big box   promo so let's get into it and as you guys are  gonna see here it is a pretty decent amount of   food for six dollars essentially it's their main  five dollar promo with an extra side and in this   case the rip'n chicken itself as you can see  they're looking pretty crispy basically rippable   pieces of chicken connected in the very side as  you can see there it almost looks like a big hand   but pieces that you can pull off nice and crispy  nice and golden i've got two sides here i decided   to go with some red beans and rice and definitely  some fries to go with as well and naturally we're   going to finish this off with one of their world  famous biscuits and for dipping i decided to go   with some mardi gras mustard because that's one  of my all-time favorite sauces here but guys still   looking pretty fantastic for what you're getting  here for the money and like i said at the top   of this review what's old is new again so it's  nice to see this actually back on the menu and   it's been a very long time considering they  usually come back and revisit some of their   promos as time goes by it's been a minute since  the rip'n chicken has been back and honestly   i think it was the beer can rip'n chicken  is what it was called there i'll make sure   to put a link to that on the screen i know  i reviewed that back in the day and actually   it's crispy fried goodness how bad is it  gonna be from popeyes but the new version   naturally with the extra side here a lovely  situation let me show it to you take a look at   that it almost looks like a hand and they always  have this little straggler here off to the side   the way this is formed together but as you can  see we've got some rippable pieces of chicken   looks like about six or seven pieces here one two  three four five six seven or so so and actually   not too bad for what it is and again the promo  with the two sides depending upon what you get   still a pretty decent value all right so enough  talking let me pull one of these off here just   to give you a look basically they are just like  this they're just ripping pieces of chicken as   you can see crispy fried golden goodness all  the louisiana seasonings of popeyes together   really a nice situation i'm sure  it's going to be let's give it a shot crunchy a little bit of heat  a little bit of sizzle but   the same standard popeyes the outer  crispy coating an amazing situation   let me just pull a bigger chunk of this off so  you guys can take a look at that white meat there   all throughout very lovely situation you can kind  of see some of the marinated spicing that they do   underneath the coating that's what's giving  you a little bit of that sizzle but crispy   very very nicely fried golden brown all the  standard goodness here as you can see not hating   on it it's what i expected it to be not bad and  speaking of not bad but i think it's going to go   really really well with it it's one of my all-time  favorites is their mardi gras mustard sauce here   this is pretty bomb if this is actually one of  your favorites drop some comments down below let   me know what you think of this one a little bit  of that horseradish action a nice creaminess to   go with a very lovely situation and only because i  don't want to take too big of a chunk all up front   here let's make this last just a little bit here  we go got it all ready to go as you guys can see   nice creamy goodness we'll keep that in focus  for you lovely situation let's give it a shot   hmm it's kind of fun revisiting this after a while  pretty good and considering with the size of this   even though there's like six or seven pieces  you can pull apart you can pretty much break   those in half and have a little bit of extra  here so initially i was kind of thinking this   really didn't seem like it was going to be pretty  large for what you're getting more of the sides   and a little bit of the chicken but so far the  balance is not bad pretty good and real quick just   to bring up one of their cajun fries the usual  goodness here i've done this a bunch of different   times throughout the years over the reviews i've  done here at popeyes a little bit of the crispy   goodness let's give this a shot always good very  good but for me it's always going to be about   the red beans and rice action here so let me get  this actually kind of mixed up just a little bit   really love the flavor of this all the nice light  spiciness its got and of course that combination   of the beans and the rice together almost feels  like it's got a little bit of bacon action mixed   into the mix as well the flavoring is smoked  um which is pretty good with this pretty solid   same old same old good though i mean not  bad but even still your mileage may vary   you have your choice of size to go with  this there it's nice to see a big box value   um after so long here even though it's typically  more than the five dollar range that it usually is   but even still see if i can try and pull a little  bit off here for you as you can see more of that   white meat action very very lovely situation and  again just a very very fun shape this is very   reminiscent of the orange blossom chicken i think  it was back then where it almost was like a bloom   like a flower bloom that opened up so this is a  similar type of concept that's actually a newer   version of this type of chicken but the fact that  they're actually dropping the beer can name from   this for some reason and just bringing it back  with the standard rip'n chicken name and the   big box thrown into the mix is really the only  difference with it it's the same stuff all around still really good though and real quick before  we close this one out here let me go for a   quick little dip of the biscuit with some of  that sauce there let me try and lift that up   just a bit as you guys can see always  a lovely situation no matter what the   promo sauce is for these promos over here  at popeyes you really want to dip it into   the biscuit to give it a go but let's  give this a shot with the mardi gras   hmm horseradish little spice the butteriness  crispiness of this one too lovely situation on   the inside nice and buttery always the bomb here  at popeyes always all right now let's go for one   more bite of this one before we close this one out  here a little bit more of the crispy action for   you very cool value for six bucks and naturally  what you're seeing here is a very lovely situation   of crispy goodness from popeyes that you know  and love with the standard sauces and of course   the return of a pretty popular name at least for  the item anyway rip'n chicken pretty awesome well i very rarely if ever re-reviewed the items  i've done here on my channel and considering   this one has dropped the beer can name i was  very curious to see if there's going to be   something different about it and the only thing  that really is is the fact they're getting an   extra side thrown into the mix now granted it's  a dollar more than it usually is so naturally   if it's five dollars normally six dollars for  the extra side is not a bad value with a drink   about $7.49 or so over here at my local popeyes but  even still you're getting a decent amount of food   even though the chicken itself i wish was just a  little bit larger you can actually make that last   by ripping it off in maybe smaller pieces but even  still it's exactly what it says it is the return   of a favorite rip'n chicken and honestly still  super fun to check out so with that said i'm gonna   have to give the returning rip'n chicken here  at popeyes a pretty solid 8 out of 10 like   i said the value is really what's selling this one  and considering it's a dollar more expensive than   it usually is for the promos here at popeyes  you are getting an extra side and the big box   name does satisfy for what that is because it  is it's two sides you get a biscuit and a decent   amount of chicken although i do wish it was just a  little bit larger even though you can make it last   still guys very decent for the money and like i  said the familiar popeyes flavor you know and love   it's just back on the menu right now  for the new year what's old is new again   okay so if you're a fan of popeyes are you super  glad this one's back on the menu right now i'd   venture to guess if you're this far into the  review watching this you probably are but if   you're a fan of this particular chicken over  here the rip'n chicken are you surprised   they waited this long to bring it back drop some  comments down below and definitely let me know   and with that this is Ian K closing out another  high quality foodie feature for you here on   peep this out reviews bringing you brand new  content every single week here on my channel   so while you stay tuned for that next review coming real soon in the meantime stay frosty a wicked good   deal with this one popeyes a
