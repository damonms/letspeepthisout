 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty good morning everyone and welcome back to another  high quality foodie feature for you here on the   channel where this time i'm over at bk early in  the AM because the french toast sandwiches are   back on the menu for 2021 only this time they're  getting a little bit of an upgrade and of course   i'll most definitely explain guys feast your eyes  on the returning french toast sandwiches here to   BK and obviously what we've got here is a very  lovely situation of breakfast goodness in the   palm of my hand gotta admit this is already  looking and smelling pretty tasty already   and how could it not considering one of the main  stars of the show feast your eyes on the french   toast bread itself guys not too bad in the size  department although i do wish it was a little bit   larger let's pop it and take a look underneath  and as you guys are gonna see this is actually   very buttery and what that actually is is a new  buttery maple sauce and there's no shortage of   it it smells pretty fantastic along with it for  this variant is two slices of black forest ham   we have a slice of american cheese and underneath  that you're going to find a nice folded egg i'm   definitely digging the eggs over here at BK  very tasty looking underneath that it looks   like it's just the bottom of the french toast  bread itself but there is more of that buttery   maple sauce guys and i got to admit it really  is very strong i can't wait to get into it   but before we do let me give you a shot of this  buttery maple sauce because i have some on the   side here in a small little container and as  you can see it looks pretty thick guys i'm   very excited about this one already there because  like i said the aroma is really lighting up my car   so there you go it's the french toast sandwich  the black forest ham variant here at BK   let's peep out this flavor yesir no shortage of  that buttery maple goodness in my hands it almost   feels like this should be on a plate considering  it's a sandwich there is a lot of that goodness in   here and again the maple is strong i'm definitely  digging the way that french toast looks as well   very very lovely on this one guys here we go it's  the french toast sandwich the black forest ham   variant here at BK repeating it one last time  because we're going in right now let's do it mmm that's a major upgrade wow yeah that buttery  maple action is definitely lighting this one up   guys considering it is on the top and the  bottom you'd expect it to be and obviously   you can see it's very moist at the same time  but guys the flavor is very vibrant it really   feels like it's a step up from say putting  traditional maple syrup on here which they   typically have with breakfast sandwiches anyway  i think i did that the last time around when   i checked out the bacon variant take a look at  that review popping up on your screen right now   this does not need that whatsoever it's very  vibrant in your face and considering the variant   of this one the black forest ham is pretty good  with the eggs let's go for another bite guys tasty yeah this is a pretty nice balance of butter  maple and a little bit of sweetness guys but   the vibrancy of the maple really stands out and  then you have a little bit of that butter back   end that comes up there but i gotta say guys it  goes very nicely with the french toast as well   again i wish it was just a little bit crispier  but at the same time you're getting that french   toast flavor it does feel like that's what you're  eating and of course with the eggs and depending   upon your choice of protein the black forest  ham is definitely doing its job because that   flavor is there as well and you know what since i  got it here let me show you one more time because   i do kind of want to try this on its own and as  you guys can see very very thick it's not just a   little syrupy type of situation here this is very  thick it almost feels like it's gravy the way that   it looks here but let me just try this just on  its own oh yeah that is crazy good guys this is   really really tasty the sweetness like i said is  not crazy over the top but the maple flavor is   so strong and then you're getting a buttery  back end so like i said the quality of that   is a very very lovely situation indeed and when  you have a little bit on the top and the bottom   of what i've got here this is actually a lovely  situation in general you're gonna find this is   pretty tasty guys with that and like i said you  really do not need the regular maple syrup that   they would serve with breakfast in general and  like i said before even though i did that the last   time around i believe i did this is actually so  much better because it's everything all in one the   only downside is you need a lot of napkins because  it's a little on the buttery side my fingers right   now are pretty much lit up but still very tasty  guys let's go for another couple bites on this   and again coming back to the protein of choice  for this review in this case the black forest   ham i don't really get it as often because like  i said i've already done the bacon egg and cheese   variant from back in the day so obviously with  this i wanted to go for a little bit different   and since breakfast sausage is not really my go-to  outside of bacon i really wanted to go for the ham   variant and i got to say it works pretty well but  again i just wish it was a little bit crispier on   the french toast itself there it's a little on  the soggy side and a little on the small side   but at the same time the quality of what you're  getting with this one is pretty good in the flavor   department that overall upgrade with the buttery  maple sauce is what's really the big highlight   with this one on top of the fact that this is  just back on the menu you don't see a lot of   french toast sandwiches from fast food places and  BK does a pretty good one guys this actually is   pretty tasty all right so let's go for one more  bite on this one and we'll close the review out   after the rating coming up here but guys since  i'm not really a morning person i'm glad i got   up super early to give this a shot because like i  said that buttery maple sauce is selling this one   to me big time the quality is pretty awesome one  more bite we'll finish it out well there's really   not too much left to say about this one guys you  get a nice little situation for breakfast here   especially if you like french toast and the fact  that it has this buttery maple action to go with   you're really gonna dig that it really is a very  nice quality made type of sauce for this and it   really does highlight the upgrade for what they've  got here so i'm glad this one's back on the menu   i just wish the french toast was just a little bit  crispier and that's really going to kind of dock   this one slightly but overall the quality of it  flavor-wise is really really tasty not bad at all   so with that said i'm gonna have to give the  returning french toast sandwich with the new   buttery maple sauce upgrade here at bk a pretty  decent 8.2 out of 10 guys this could have been   so much closer to a 9 plus had the price been just  a little bit less and the crispiness of the french   toast being there but as it stands that sauce is  really really the main highlight with this on top   of the fact that you're tasting french toast in a  breakfast sandwich it was really really tasty your   protein of choice may vary in this case the black  forest was pretty good again bacon is my favorite   but i wanted to do this one just a little bit  differently and of course you've got sausage to   go in on but guys like i said that buttery maple  sauce that is a huge huge upgrade with this one   and well worth giving it a shot even if you liked  it the last time i think you're gonna like it even   more with it yeah i'm willing to bet that you guys  are gonna dig these french toast sandwiches with   this new buttery maple sauce guys it really is  pretty tasty but do me a quick favor drop some   comments down below let me know if you're gonna  give this one a shot and if you've had it before   how excited are you to try it with this new  upgrade drop those comments down below and   definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K  closing out another high quality foodie feature   for you here on peep this out reviews bringing  you brand new content

now we've got the return of the french   toast sandwich to BK and considering i'm not a  morning person by nature i'm so glad that this   upgrade is making it worth getting up at 7am to  give this a go guys because it was pretty tasty   alright everyone until next time i'll talk to you  soon hey thanks for checking out another one of   my reviews but just in case you didn't see the one  before
