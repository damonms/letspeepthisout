 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty hey everyone welcome back to another high quality  foodie feature for you here in the channel where   this time i'm over at little caesars because  after checking out the thin crust pepperoni   pizza back in the day along with the original  extra most bestest even further back than that   i think it's time we combine the two and complete  the trifecta so as you already know and without   further ado let's get into the extra most bestest  thin crust pepperoni pizza and as always guys   we're looking at one of the best values and fast  food pizza by far this is looking pretty fantastic   so let's break this one down starting off with  the fact that we've got a large little caesars   pizza here guys topped off with a nice blend  of muenster and mozzarella cheese from edge to   edge actually an extra portion of it and the  other star of the show that it's sitting on is   actually some vine ripe and tomato sauce their  standard pizza sauce actually but guys the main   star of the show on top of all of that is about  50 slices of pepperoni about 80% more than their   classic pizza and it's also edge to edge and  looking pretty nice and not to be outshined by   all that pepperoni the other major star of the  show is obviously the thin crust and as you can   see they're taking it to the extreme guys it  looks almost cracker-like but extremely thin   and it's definitely looking nice and toasty and  of course it complements all the other goodness in   this pizza all for about $6.49 so not bad all right  so let's see if this one's gonna deliver it's   the extra most bestest thin crust pepperoni pizza  here at little caesars let's peep out this flavor   yeah definitely thin along with looking very  crispy looking and guys the aroma in my car   is pretty fantastic at the moment here so let me  put this down and we'll definitely get into this   but guys again pretty awesome for $6.49 let me  pull up one of these slices over here and give   you a look at it very excited to give this one  a shot right now i'm in the mood for this and   this is actually looking really really good  nice and toasty on the bottom as you can see   a little greasy as i noticed as I was picking  a slice up here right now but guys it is pepperoni   pizza after all let's give this a shot it's the  extra most bestest thin crust pepperoni pizza   here at little caesars let's bang it out mmm you  know maybe i was getting a little ahead of myself   by saying that this was going to be a banging  situation right now aside from saying let's peep   this out because i did that earlier but guys it is  a banging situation i'm glad i kind of jumped the   gun slightly because the flavor is amazing as  you'd expect it to be from little caesars it's   got all the right flavors of pepperoni a solid  amount of cheese the toastiness of that crust   on the bottom and overall the presentation  again very inviting let's keep going in oh yeah come on i like the fact that the piece  that i picked up is kind of curled in the back   here guys because it makes it a little bit easier  to hold and as you can see very cracker-like   with the type of thin crust here like i mentioned  earlier they're taking this to the extreme because   it's thin crust but guys it's virtually a little  bit more than a few sheets of paper high actually   but i'm really digging the quality it's nice and  toasty and of course the flavor of that muenster   and mozzarella is complementing it nicely with that  pepperoni you know i don't know what's more fun   about this right now the fact that i'm having  little caesars for the first time since doing   the return of their pretzel crust pizza along with  the pizza sauce which you guys are probably seeing   popping up on your screen here right now i gotta  say i'm kind of glad to return to this one and   obviously combine it with all that pepperoni  action on top of it but aside from all that   i gotta say it's ultra fun picking this up from  their pizza portal in store and as you're seeing   here on screen i think that's part of the phone  overall guys because once you pop in that code   and pull this out of the system that they have  over there it is just a very lovely situation   very contactless in terms of how it works and  overall it's fast and efficient and before you   start commenting down below hashtag unsponsored  i just love showing the process in my videos guys   and i have to admit it is super fun to do on  top of the flavor of this let's keep going in i'm so in the mood for this right now tasty  i guess it really is all about the flavor and   obviously with me here in my reviews the way i do  things of course the presentation also scores big   time now looking at what i got here right now  i do have to say my cut of this pizza right now   is a little bit on the haphazard side i think  it was made a little too quick actually there   because some pieces are a little bit larger than  others some are not really shaped correctly in   terms of just the size meaning some kind of look  like little squares and some are more rectangular   and overall guys i have to say there's one in  particular let me pick this one up for you here   right now that's one of the corner pieces there  take a look at that that is kind of funny right   there so if you're really kind of hankering to  go for like a traditional style cut on this one   more triangle you have a little bite size nug  right over here i might as well just do it right   still pretty tasty with a lot of cheese though  even in that little piece that's pretty awesome   so yeah that actually is really really good  guys let me pick up another piece of this   really quick because i'm really digging the fact  that the ones in the very back have this little   curved edge over here this could be something  they may want to consider doing in the future   it's almost reminiscent of their deep dish but  just showing you how much less of it that you   actually have here really digging that overall  but guys nice quality and i have to say again   a lovely situation on this guys a beautiful thing  overall and i got to say the toastiness again   i really love the fact that that little grease  action from the pepperoni is kind of soaking   into it and of course it goes nicely with all the  oils of the cheese on this one very very awesome   the extra most bestest thin crust just $6.49  pizza pizza so yeah i think you get the point   in terms of where i'm going with this one right  now guys it still is one of the best values and   fast food pizza that's out there and obviously  with almost 50 slices of pepperoni on top of that   and a lot of cheese from edge to edge they're  really kind of giving you that deliciousness   from edge to edge as they say and that really  does satisfy especially for $6.49 pretty awesome   so with all that said i'm gonna have to give  the extra most bestest thin crust pepperoni   pizza here little caesars a rock solid 9 out  of 10 and the only reason i'm docking at a point   is because the cut of my pizza is definitely  all over the place here right now but of course   i definitely like the edges that i have on  one of them or at least two or three or four   or five of them actually on one side of the  pizza but still guys it virtually is a 10 it's   little caesars you know the flavor i definitely  recommend it to you as always pretty tasty stuff   all right so if you've made it this far into the  review i already know you're probably going to   be giving this one a shot if you haven't already  so i'm simply just going to ask you which do you   prefer the thin crust pizza like i reviewed  right now or their standard deep deep dish   drop those comments down below and definitely  let me know and with that this is Ian K   closing out another high quality foodie feature  for you here on peep this out reviews bringing   you brand new content every single week here on  my channel so while you stay tuned for that next review   coming real soon in the meantime stay frosty  i'm not gonna fault you too much for raising   the price slightly on this one since the last  time you brought it out little caesars i believe   initially when you launched it it was six dollars  so at $6.49 i think it's a pretty decent pill to   swallow considering it's extra most bestest a lot  of pepperoni and a lot of cheese banging alright   guys until next time i'll talk to you soon hey  thanks for checking out another one of my reviews   but just in case you didn't see the one before  this one you can find it right up over here along   with what i think youtube's going to recommend  for you to check out as well as always i think   you'll find something to like in both of them and  i'll definitely catch you in the next one see ya
