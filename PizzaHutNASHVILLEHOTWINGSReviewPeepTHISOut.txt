 hey everyone I'm back out at this time over a Pizza Hut to take a look at the latest hotness they've got going on the menu and that literally could be the case guys because it's Nashville hot wings so stay tuned because they're up next welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty so on the inside of this Death Star like wing Street dome here at Pizza Hut is their all-new Nashville hot wings and initial first impressions I am NOT impressed guys there is really not a lot of sauce in here even on the very bottom it looks a little on the light side but what we've got here is eight pieces of their boneless wings essentially the glorified Nuggets topped off with their Nashville hot sauce featuring what they're calling a blend of tangy savory sweet flavors basically cayenne pepper sauce here is really kind of what it is but as you can see not a lot to speak of there is a little bit of the aroma in the air but so far not impressed with the amount I was expecting these to be a little bit more heavily sauced here guys but it is what it is let's see if the flavor is gonna deliver on these they definitely look nice and crispy nice and fried but I'm really hoping the heat is gonna be there it's the Nashville hot wings brand-new here at Pizza Hut let's peep out this flavor yeah guys I got to be honest presentation wise I am NOT impressed with this so far and honestly for almost 10 dollars after tax this is really gonna have to deliver in the flavor Department I'm really hoping it's gonna so before I confirm that for you and like always if you guys are fans of high

we go let me try and sauce up just a little bit of these wings here a little further I'm really not digging the fact that there is hardly any sauce on them guess it is mostly on the bottom there let's give it a shot the Nashville hot wings brand new here at Pizza Hut oh that is hot that is very hot whoa that is definitely killing the back of my throat right now this is gonna be a tough review to get through man that Cayenne is blowing me away instantly guys take a look at that there it is very very coated in the bottom I have like a little puddle of that cayenne sauce or the Nashville hot sauce on the bottom right now my mouth is watering ridiculous glutton for punishment let's go for another bite wow that is insanely strong oh and that is no joke that is no joke at all man this is gonna be hard to get through but as you can see I took a bite of another one so you can get a nice close-up shot of that white meat there guys the Nashville hot sauce is no joke here at Pizza Hut this is very very strong definitely diggin the coating on the outside I'm really glad that I got these wings this way because I think you're getting more meat for the money considering an eight-piece for $8.69 compared to $8.99 for a six piece of the bone in this I think is a better value but as you can see it is no joke the flavor is delivering and overall I am satisfied in that department already but let's just keep going with it and of course like always I don't have anything to drink here at all I've got no water I've got no dipping sauce would you believe this doesn't even come with a dipping sauce you have to pay 75 cents extra for it that's a no bueno situation this is kind of an expensive little quote-unquote side item at almost $10 but guys the heat delivers on it then they go for another bite real quick of this one and then we'll just keep going as far as I can with it but so far the flavor is delivering that is the most important thing hmmm I like that I like that a lot but of course I'd like it better if I had some water and something cool that it dip into now I'm thinking I should have invested and at least some ranch to go with this because there's Nashville hot it's seriously hot it is really really strong but nice guys really really good stuff like I said earlier you've got an 8 piece for $8.69 at least here on the west coast compared to about nine dollars for a six piece it's very expensive for what you get here I got to be honest it's not the best value but they heat delivers and that's really the selling point that's gonna probably raise the points just a little bit let's go for one more bite because I'm beginning to lose my voice right now no joke and then we'll close this one out after the rating but guys I'm glad I tried this right now my taste buds are at least my throat isn't hang on let's go for one more alright let me give you another shot of this one here this is how they should come guys all sauced up ridiculous here not kind of naked on the very back like this but the sauce like I said no joke that Cayenne is kicking big time I'm not really getting anything sweet and tangy but it's a lot of heat and definitely a lot of overall flavor the Cayenne like I said is super strong and the overall nashville name for being hot is on point so as i'm losing my voice right now this is the last close up for this review so let's wrap this one out because i am dying right now yeah definitely awesome but not something believe it or not that I would get again strictly because it's super expensive for what you get but I really love that sauce it's awesome but the price needs to definitely come down on it so overall I'm gonna have to give the Nashville hot wings and in this case the Nashville hot nuggs here at pizza are pretty rock solid 7 out of 10 as good as the flavor is I can't justify paying almost $10 for eight wings guys like I said the value is not really there but the flavor is so your mileage may vary if you think that's a deal I would definitely give it a shot if you're looking for some serious heat you've come to the right place because that delivers so as my mouth is continuing to water ridiculously here right now do me a quick favor drop some comments down below are you a fan of Nashville hot in general and who do you think has the most authentic version of Nashville hot out of all
