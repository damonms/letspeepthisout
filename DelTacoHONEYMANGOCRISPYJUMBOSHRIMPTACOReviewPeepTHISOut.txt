 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty hey everyone welcome back to another high quality  foodie feature for you here on the channel   cheaters cam style after hours over at del taco  because with fish season in full swing it looks   like they've brought back their jumbo shrimp  and guys guess what not only is it crispy we've   got a honey mango variant to go in on so without  further ado and i got to be careful with this one   feast your eyes on the honey mango crispy jumbo  shrimp taco let me try and keep that focus for   you there feast your eyes on that looking pretty  nice jumbo shrimp action for you guys what you're   looking at here is supposed to be a warm flour  tortilla filled with jumbo crispy shrimp and in   this case we've got three of them we've got  some crunchy cabbage some honey mango sauce   and some homemade pico de gallo they  actually do this in store pretty cool   and guys i got to admit the presentation looks  really really inviting so because we're outside   right now this is not going to be a very long  video let's get into it guys let's give this one   a shot once again it's the honey mango crispy  jumbo shrimp taco here at del taco here we go oh yeah plenty of cabbage succulent shrimp  and there goes the honey mango lovely   you know the honey mango sauce is so strong on  this i don't really mind the tomato the pico de   gallo a little bit of cilantro in there because  it's overpowering all of that and i got to admit   i am digging this it's a total showcase for the  sauce and an easy recommendation to give a go   but the succulentness of the shrimp is primo  guys definitely crispy definitely plump   about three shrimp on the inside almost  one of them is gone right away let's go   for another bite we'll give you  a close-up not bad guys not bad oh yeah the honey mango is ridiculous this is  literally like a three or four biter so let   me swing this around the back for you so you guys  can take a look at that shrimp again a nice lovely   situation they are definitely jumbo and i gotta  admit the thickness is on point very light coating   on it as well guys i'm really digging that but  overall it's really standing out beautifully with   the honey mango sauce a lovely situation indeed  let's go for another bite this is pretty nice oh yeah come on all day long or all night long in  this case and because it looks like i've already   bitten into half of the second one take a look  at that you can see it right there guys a decent   amount of shrimp on the inside the breading is  not too bad but i gotta admit again that honey   mango is soaking up all that goodness beautifully  and of course that crunchy cabbage to go with this   and also the tortilla a very lovely situation  guys in terms of flavor and again i keep coming   back to it the honey mango is definitely on  point if you guys haven't seen my del taco   reviews i've done recently on the epic honey mango  goodness take a look at that speaking of which   the epic burrito they have there with chicken and  bacon you've got the crispy chicken taco as well   a beautiful showcase of sweet with a  little bit of sizzle just a little bit   but i gotta admit guys it's more of a  sweetness and that like robust citrusy flavor   on top of what the protein is and in this case  you've got some chicken of the sea in this case   of course it's going to be shrimp so a lovely  situation we'll go for one more bite to close this   one out but guys the rating is going to be pretty  high you should expect it because the quality   of the honey mango is pretty banging over here  let's give it a go and then we'll finish it up so yeah guys with fish season and full swing  right now you've got plenty of choices fast   food wise when it comes to fast food fish and in  this case it's a really lovely situation because   these are really really good guys the shrimp tacos  here an annual event over at del taco are always   the jam definitely a lovely situation and again  that coating i'm really glad that there's a lot   more shrimp meat than coating that kind of tells  you the quality and also the size of the shrimp   in general a lovely situation indeed an easy  recommendation especially with the honey mango   sauce and of course the pico de gallo if that's  your jam nicely made it's made here on site which   is really a lovely thing as well and of course  the crunchy cabbage to go with as i'm losing a   little bit of goodness right there let's finish  this one up guys not bad okay well doing cheaters   cam is always a fun format here on my channel  outside is another story here i thought it was   going to be kind of a quickie thing to do and  i wasn't really going to freeze as much as i am   but guys i'm literally turning blue right now my  fingernails are turning blue so with that said i'm   going to have to give the honey mango crispy jumbo  shrimp taco over here at del taco a rock solid 8   out of 10 nice quality overall the price being  just a little elevated $2.99 is more of a premium   because it's seafood but at the same time you're  getting some fresh ingredients and the size is   pretty nice as well naturally you can do a little  combo action with this one as well too to kind of   bring the price a little bit more in line they  do have a 2 for $5 so that's always a lovely   thing and an easy recommendation of course you can  get this without the honey mango but you really   want to go for the honey mango because that's the  main promo right now and it really does showcase   a lot of the extra flavor that you're going to get  on whatever you get in this case the shrimp taco   it delivers it really does all right so now  the all-important question aside from asking if   you're actually going to be giving this one a shot  because if you've made it this far into the review   you're probably going to is fish season like one  of your all-time favorite seasons when it comes to   fast food do you like all the fish choices out  there and if you're a fan of fish does this look   like something you're gonna give a shot anyway  drop those comments down below and definitely   let me know and with that this is Ian K closing  out another high quality foodie feature for you   here on peep this out reviews outside cheaters cam  style bringing you brand new content every single   week here on my channel so while you stay tuned for  that next review coming real soon in the meantime   stay frosty all right now i wish i got  two but i guess i can always go back
