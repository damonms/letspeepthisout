 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty hey everyone I'm back at this time over a Taco Bell once again to take a look at their latest frozen fruity drink and this one looks definitely up my alley since I'm a huge fan of strawberry that's right it's the wild strawberry candy freeze and this one is absolutely looking really really nice guys take a look at that frosty goodness right there and your eyes do not deceive you those are actually candy seeds on the very top and they're actually all throughout mostly on the bottom though as you can see there but a very nice whipped frozen drink here they definitely do it right over here at Taco Bell the Baja freezes the watermelon freezes from back in the day but naturally with these seeds I am really digging the overall presentation of what this is of course it's very heavily red it looks really really awesome let's see how amazing this is gonna be right now I'm sure this is gonna be crazy sweet let's do it mmm-hmmm oh yeah it's that fake strawberry candy flavor I didn't get any seeds just yet you know what let me see if I can scoop one of these seeds up really quick I'm actually I'm not having a lot of good luck here with this oh there we go all right take a look right over there hopefully that's gonna stay focused you can kind of see it on the straw anyway let's give that a shot yup a very hyper piece of sugar almost tastes like blueberry believe it or not ooh it's tart it's very very tart but I like that guys nice and frosty on this we're definitely staying frosty with this one here I love the actual feel of this one and naturally getting this on happy hour right now between 2 and 5 this was just a buck right now too so a regular size a decent amount I think this is all the sugar that you need for a day actually but it's lovely flavor mmm oh yeah that classic sweet fake strawberry flavor on occasion everything in moderation I say and this is definitely a lovely lovely situation right now mmm it's sweet but not overly sweet I mean it's definitely heightened you can tell but I'm really diggin the overall presentation like I said the idea of having the seeds in with this is a pretty cool thing and naturally I don't know about you these type of seeds are not really in strawberries I see where they're going with it but now that I think about it on the real this kind of does remind me of the overall look of the watermelon style maybe just a little bit more deeper red but the whole idea of wild strawberry is a lovely situation still so like I said I'm a fan of strawberries I really enjoy them pretty much often hmm I'm considering this is technically the season for them it's nice to have something like this as well so a nice combination with this again you can't fade it for a buck lemme focus that in there really really nice guys nice and frosty super refreshing even though it's kind of a rainy day here in Southern Cali right now this is not bad at all I'm like I said for a dollar you can't hate on it mmm so yeah a nice frosty icy whipped situation with this one guys and just so you know if you're not really big on the whole seeds and the candy crunch with this one you can actually just have them leave it out and just keep the freeze as is but I think you'd want to add a little bit of crunch because it does add the texture a little bit of extra sour sweetness to it it's a nice combination I think so with that said I'm gonna have to give the wild strawberry candy freeze here at Taco Bell a pretty rock-solid 8 out of 10 this is actually a pretty tasty situation guys and like I said it's that fake strawberry flavor with a little bit of extra kick from that sour goodness coming from those fake seeds that are in here as well and again presentation-wise a lovely situation again one more time for ya I love the idea of how frosty this is it's very icy and again the presentation is really really slick so you can't go wrong with it and like I said for a buck on happy hour solid alright I've got a couple of questions for you first would you actually give this one a shot naturally because if you're a fan of strawberry I think you might want to drop those comments down below and secondly would you actually want to try this off happy hour here in Southern Cali a regular version of this is about $2.89 so would you actually spend close to 3 bucks for something like this drop those comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K closing out another episode of peep this out bringing you brand new content every single week here on my channel so while you stay tuned for that next review coming real soon in the meantime stay frosty hey Taco Bell can we get a tangerine version of this drink in the near future maybe with some tan colored seeds I think that'd be pretty cool considering you're on a candy seed kick lately alright guys until next time I'll talk to you soon but hey real quick before you go and just in case you haven't already take a look at the last review that I put out right up over here along with what I think YouTube's gonna recommend for you to check out as well as always I think you'll find something to like in both of them and I'll definitely catch ya in the next one see ya
