 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty it's not easy being cheesy it's Ian K back again with another high quality foodie feature for ya here on peep this out reviews and guys it's time for the grand finale the 3rd flavor in the cheetos mac n cheese line take a look at flamin hot I am already diggin this already guys this is already looking pretty fantastic now granted its the same marketing as before its just how they dress it up and I am really diggin that guys and as you can see on the inside look how striking red that looks you'd expect it to be of course it's gotta match the cheetos flamin hot right looking really really slick and again awesome preparation in terms of how this is put together again just to kind of go through the line like I did with the other 2 and if you haven't seen my other 2 reviews they should be popping up on your screen here right now you can take a look at them so as always with this portioned controlled containers you simply open them up you take out the packet on the inside naturally you've got all the spirally noodle goodness filling the water line up where it tells you to you stir it up drop it into the microwave for about 3 minutes or so and then you come on out and drop all that powered goodness the flamin hot powdered goodness in this case into it and then you stir it up and you are good to go and just like the others there's a little bit more water in this version compared to Kraft we'll say so actually that's what's giving you the cheesy sauce the way that it is it really thickens up and there's a lot more of it and as you can see with this version being flamin hot it's a lovely situation right there guys a lovely situation indeed so let's not waste anymore time on this I really want to get into this I'm excited to give this one a go I thought I'd hopefully save the best for last and man I am really diggin how that looks guys look at that that looks really really cool here we go the cheetos mac n cheese flamin hot flavor and calorie count 210 calories for 1 container not bad like I said portion control lets do it well oh here we go alright believe it or not that cheesy jalapeno was a little bit more pronounced up front this one's subdued but it's the same type of heat but now it's beginning to kind of kick slightly there so not bad love the a look on this one here but I have to admit the cheesy jalapeno that's kind of staying with me longer from what I remember from that one from yesterday but I am really diggin the quality of what this is and of course they need to have flamin hot as part of the product line right I mean c'mon it's cheetos right there c'mon so tasty so far let's keep going it is good not granted it's mac n cheese it's flamin hot I'm not getting a lot of cheesy flavor it tastes like a lot of really tasty noodles if I can put it that way but with the heat of flamin hot so I'm not really a very bold pronounced cheese flavor with this it's creamy but that flamin hot sauce it's actually pretty tasty guys but again the hotness that I'm getting from this one is not quite up there believe it or not with that cheesy jalapeno the more I get into this it's a little bit more subdued then it hangs back in the cut for a little bit but it's creamy it's good I'm glad I'm having it not bad and again the striking complexion of this one looks really really awesome so lemme show this to you again because I am really loving the look of that right there it almost looks like heavy ginger if you guys ever had like you know Yoshinoya it's got that red pop to it which is really really nice and as you can see it really stands out and naturally with these little portioned controlled cups the amount of the powder that they give you with this is really not in short order there's a lot of it which is good so it mixes with a decent amount of the water in this and then naturally what you get is some goodness portable cup to go as you guys can see right here pretty tasty yes tasty indeed to overall on that scale of 1 to 10 I thought this was gonna be actually one of the best ones but believe it or not I actually think it's the last out of the group and that's not necessarily a bad thing because these are still pretty tasty so overall I'm gonna have to give that flamin hot flavor version of the cheetos mac n cheese and an OK 7.5 out of 10 it's OK for what it is I'm not getting a lot of cheese flavor but it's creamy flamin hot if you're familiar with that flavor which most of you guys should be from cheetos anyway it's just OK so for me the bold and cheesy is probably gonna be the top the cheesy jalapeno being number 2 and then obviously with this one being number 3 so take a look at what I thought in terms of more detail if you wanna see those other reviews naturally but I'm glad to have given this one a shot had to complete the trifecta if you like flamin hot you're gonna like this one a lot if you're expecting a lot of cheesy flavor it's a little bit on the light side in that regard but it's still pretty tasty OK quick question for ya real fast now that I've done all 3 of the cheetos mac n cheese selections which is actually
