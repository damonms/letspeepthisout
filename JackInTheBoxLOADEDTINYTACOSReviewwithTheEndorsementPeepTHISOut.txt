 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty the wait is over try my new tiny tacos alright guys I'm back at it this time with my wingman the endorsement is in the house here right now endorsement welcome to Southern Cali once again thank you I heard a little peep told me that you actually reviewed these already finally the little tiny tacos here at jack-in-the-box what you personally think if I'm not to give too much away because I'm gonna direct people to your review but yeah direct them to the review down below I will say I was pleasantly surprised nice gonna leave it we will leave it at that now with that said I've actually reviewed these as well and I was very curious to try the loaded version of these so that's something I think you were interested too right yeah so it's the same box that comes in here naturally they're really really cool the first time I reviewed these I did the late night version of it as a cheaters cam review you'll find that review popping up on your screen right now I'm glad I have the actual box this is really really slick I have to admit looking really nice again 15 little tiny tacos a chicken based filling on the inside deep fried not beef not beef anyone who thinks it's anything except chicken I'm telling you we already know the truth it's the truth it's been verified but the difference with the loaded version it's got taco sauce it's got shredded lettuce and a cheese sauce to go with so essentially very similar to the regular taco which I hear you're not a fan of I only tried it once yeah four years a long time ago alright well hopefully this is gonna be pretty tasty so based upon the endorsements review that you'll find down below take a look at what you thought of the mini version of them but we're getting into actually the loaded version I thought it'd be a little fun thing here in Pasadena as we speak right now the weather is nice and chilly it's the end of the day very long day for both of us right now very interesting filming location Ian don't you love it we're in the parking lot of a Jack I think we should do this before we get Jacked so here we go you know what I'm gonna pull one of these up just to kind of show right here on the screen and as you can see nice and crispy nice and toasted on the inside the chicken base that's in there as well why don't you grab one as well to just to kind of re-acclimate yourself oh you got some cheesy goodness right there go for it go for it really really nice it's got some lettuce action in here as well alright you got a little bit of that cheese to here let me go for a little bit and the taco sauce too here we go loaded tiny tacos jack-in-the-box west coast I mean come on cheese sauce what this is amazing already Wow hmm the taco sauce yeah and that cheese yeah definitely get the vibe of like nachos yeah yeah it's almost like a chimichanga a little bit you know it's deep fried but I have to admit the loaded version with that cheesy goodness here I'm gonna grab one of these because I really want to show this one to you guys directly look at this lots of shredded goodness in the house there guys looking really really nice that actually is very very lovely in terms of just the amount of cheese sauce on here these are really fantastic I'm not even gonna go with a fork you're just gonna go straight out kind if like that Seinfeld episode where George ate his I think it was George ate a Snickers with a fork that I won't do but this actually is positioned perfect let's go for it again check it out mmm delicious here we go yes all right as good as that was and that actually was really good that cheese sauce the taco sauce the shredded lettuce it really is a nice complement to its already a pretty tasty tiny taco to begin with you guys saw the initial close-up you know what's coming the creamy avocado lime sauce this stuff is lethally delicious already I know it's gonna be delicious let me put this down we're gonna crack this one open or get ourselves ready here outfitted for battle and if you guys have seen my review again up on the corner of your screen really strong lime you can already taste it already in the air I should say pretty amazingly there let me have you grab one and I'm gonna grab another one again these are the loaded dealies and I got to go quick with this so we got stuff hanging right here here we go creamy avocado lime let's do this oh no brainer no-brainer no-brainer on this one yeah this strong lime again I'm getting that hint of lime Tostitos vibe with like a sour creamy like of avocado but man a taco sauce the cheese this is the way to have this it really is man what do you think of this this is just insane I like it sets it off creamy has that avocado feel that perfect amount of lime not too much perfect perfect combo yeah especially with the loaded version and I think like I said in my initial review this sauce they need to put on like breaded type of chicken right some type of sandwich it really is really really tasty easy recommendation you already know the tiny tacos amazing loaded version I'm glad I gave it a shot that was a bunch of you out that was telling me coming back to Jack and let's do this over here do it up right do the loaded how to do it with my boy the endorsement right now in the house visiting from the East Coast thanks so much for coming on out to
