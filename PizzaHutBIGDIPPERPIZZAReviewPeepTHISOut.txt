 hey everyone I'm back at it this time headed into Pizza Hut on a rainy day for a little dip dip action on their Big Dipper pizza so stay tuned because it's up next welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty well the box is huge and for good reason it's nearly two feet long with this Big Dipper pizza here at Pizza Hut and guys I got to admit this actually looks really really awesome what we've got here is 24 dippable Pizza breadsticks and your choice of sauces to go with here guys this is actually looking really really great I decided to go with the half-and-half you can do all cheese all pepperoni or you can do the half that you see here so we've got 12 sticks of the pepperoni and we've got 12 sticks of the cheese so looking really fantastic nice and toasty for dipping we've got some ranch we've got some honey barbecue and we've got two marinaras here but man this definitely looks like a really awesome party pack and I got to admit I am really digging the presentation on this one hear let's see if we can do a little flyby once again looking nice and toasty and on a rainy day this is definitely awesome right now so crispy it definitely looks like there's a decent amount of pepperoni for sure but a very nice situation here guys it's the Big Dipper pizza here at Pizza Hut let's peep out this flavor man I am a glutton for punishment right now guys not only is it a rainy day as of this recording right now at this very moment I'm actually reviewing something in my car that's literally about two feet long on top of it so it's kind of crazy to try and do this right now there's really no nice way to do this but I'm gonna give it my best shot so before I get started in like always if you guys are fans of high quality delicious looking food

box close to anyway right here in front of you this is kind of crazy let me start off with one of these here I'm gonna start off with the cheese first this is actually a very lovely situation as you can see nice and crispy nice and toasted no sauce on this whatsoever it's basically a glorified breadstick with some mozzarella cheese on it here but let me just go for a quick bite and then we'll do some dip action hang on hmm it's exactly what it says it is it's like a breadstick really and there's nothing wrong with that because the dough is pretty nice the cheese is pretty nice it's nice and crunchy on the very top and the fact that there's no sauce on it is actually a good thing because that's the purpose of all these dips that we have here so let me go for the plastic marinara real quick here just to give a little bit of that real pizza vibe as you guys can see they're looking nice and toasted up with that sauce let's give this a shot by itself real quick straight cheese pizza as you'd expect pretty good and let's go down the line real quick a little honey barbecue not really found a barbecue sauce on pizza but then again this is like glorified breadstick action here guys let's give this a shot nice and thick on this one let's taste it yeah it's just okay very very sweet the honey is coming through very nice though I like that and as for the ranch that's one of my all-time favorites of course you guys all know what ranch looks like right there very lovely situation let's give it a shot mm-hmm ranch definitely then the marinara and the honey barbecue believe it or not not really found a barbecue like I said but that ranch is good so yeah I'm in the middle of a crazy rainstorm right now having some Big Dipper pizza with you guys here in the car lovely situation indeed let's go into the pepperoni version of it as you guys can see each one has got about two or three pepperonis it's like three on each slice there nice situation nice and crunchy nice and toasted plenty of cheese as well let's try it by itself just like the other cheese when as always with some of the pepperoni flair going with it they're not bad definitely not bad crispy edges on the pepperoni as well let's match it up a little marinara action here lovely situation of course so we've got the marinara goodness and the pepperoni stuff to go with here we go that's good you know my only gripe I didn't mention this earlier the marinara is kind of on the cold side this is only minutes old but this marinara should be warm but it's all right into the honey barbecue goodness here there we go not really a fan of this this is probably gonna be the only time I'm gonna try it but as you can see nice and thick let's see how it is with the pepperoni flavor no no mm-hmm way too sweet a lot of heavy sweetness on that pretty much drowns out the flavor of the pepperoni and everything else but I am getting a little bit of it coming up on the back end which is not bad the crust itself though I do like that a lot a little bit more of the pan style it's got a little butteriness to it a nice situation let me finish it off with what I think is gonna be my favorite already only because I guess I'm kind of biased towards ranch but with pepperoni here how bad get this really be let's give it a shot mmm that is the combo it's always the combo as far as I'm concerned mmm man that's really good mm-hmm yeah definitely awesome and just overall I think a better way to go with this would be the half-and-half so if you're really big fans of pepperoni but you still want a little bit of cheese this is pretty much designed for like parties that type of thing so people have their choice on what to do I like the choice of dipping sauces with the exception of that honey barbecue not really a fan of that as I keep saying throughout this review but guys I love the presentation of this I love how everything feels like it keeps going and going when you open the box and you're kind of scrolling through and you're seeing everything in here this is a pretty lovely situation and at about 50 to 55 cents per piece when you think about it 13 bucks for this not too bad for what it is guys I got to admit nice little add-on to a regular pizza that you would get here so yeah I would easily recommend this but honestly I would probably replace the honey barbecue if you can with maybe another ranch or something else that you'd want to dip into this with but like I said it's nice to have a choice with this I'm really kind of surprised honey barbecue is what they settled on I don't really think it fits with this type of thing but the marinara of course it is what it is the ranch being what it is as well but the honey barbecue not sure why to be honest so with all that said I'm gonna have to give the Big Dipper Pizza aka the Big Dipper breadstick platter as far as I'm concerned a pretty decent 9 out of 10 this will absolutely satisfy a whole group of people guys and the fact that you're getting a decent amount on top of it at nearly two feet long is a lovely situation just in terms of presentation it wins cost wise not too bad at about 54 55 cents a piece and I'm definitely diggin overall presentation like I said very cool but that honey barbecue no bueno at least for me anyway but of course that's just my opinion what do you guys think do me a quick favor drop some comments down below let me know what you guys thought of this Big Dipper Pizza aka the breadstick platter is this something that you think you'd probably want to rock with and hey for those of you who've been around for a while do you guys remember the big foot pizza does this kind of remind you of that got those comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K
