 hey everyone welcome back to another high quality  foodie feature for you here on the channel   so check this out i'm actually over at buffalo  wild wings right now because like most every   other fast food or fast casual restaurant they've  got a brand new chicken sandwich on the menu   and you can actually get this one with wild  sauce so stay tuned because it's up next   welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty so here we go with the classic chicken sandwich  combo here at b-dubs and i gotta say for $5.99   this is looking pretty solid guys definitely  on point in the presentation department   so starting it off we've got a very healthy  portion of their natural cut french fries guys   lightly salted and i gotta say they are absolutely  plentiful plenty of skin on them as well   definitely very nice but we're here for the  star of the show that classic chicken sandwich   and already guys the presentation of it alone  is looking very reminiscent of popeyes believe   it or not i'm really digging the fact that this  has got a challah bun let's pop it and take a look   underneath and while there's nothing underneath  the top of the bun itself feast your eyes on   the beer battered hand breaded chicken breast a  very crispy situation for sure and it looks very   sizable as well not only that it looks like it's  seasoned and fried to a crispy golden brown almost   perfectly very lovely situation guys very nice  underneath it looks like we've got a few thick   cut pickles as well as the usual mayo but guys  again the star of the show with that chicken is   looking pretty awesome even underneath it as well  and because the option was there i decided to get   a little bit of their wild sauce supposedly a  combination of buffalo with some intense heat   so very excited to give this one a shot guys and  as you can see the presentation again is on point   with this chicken sandwich a nice value for $5.99  so far so there you go it's the classic chicken   sandwich here at buffalo wild wings let's peep out  this flavor yeah i'm totally getting some popeyes   and kfc vibes with this one guys it's looking  really fantastic on this challah bun and i have   to say again the presentation is just primo it's a  very thick piece of chicken for sure and of course   you've got the pickles a little bit of the mayo to  go with but again i'm very impressed that they're   actually using challah bread with this for those  of you guys who don't know challah is basically a   type of bread that uses a lot of eggs to make it  so it has a very golden like appearance and it's   a little bit more of a doughy type of bread and i  personally really like that so that is a very cool   little add-on with this but again the presentation  is primo when you combine that golden color of   the bun along with that thick piece of the chicken  right there and of course with those thick pickles   you've got a very tasty looking chicken sandwich  eating experience on top of this one very excited   all right so let's see if i can contain my  excitement by finally going in on this and   guys i got to admit this is probably like my  50 or 60th type of chicken sandwich review   i've done over the years considering all of them  that have come out so far let's give this one   a shot it's the classic chicken sandwich  over here buffalo wild wings let's do it whoa whoa shut the front door with this  one guys this is a ridiculous situation   already take a look at the thickness of that  chicken breast on the inside the light coating   that's got on the outside believe it or not  there's more chicken than coating and i am really   digging that this is a really awesome situation  right now and i have to admit the flavor is very   nice it's seasoned very nicely nice crispy fried  goodness right now and the juiciness is not bad   either this is really something special right  now i'm really digging this already you know i   was really hoping with that $5.99 price point this  was still gonna deliver some awesome flavor for a   lower cost because ultimately that's what you want  you want big flavor without breaking the bank to   get it and i got to say guys i'm already impressed  with the quality of the chicken on this right now   so much so that i'm going to pause for a quick  second because i want to get into some of these   natural cut fries real fast so let me pull one  of these up they give you a decent amount and as   you guys can see there hopefully that's going to  focus in probably not maybe there you go very very   nice in terms of the size too these are really  kind of thick cut they're long which is nice   the saltiness is on point and the natural  cut makes such a difference with the skin   that really does right there guys take a look at  that very nice very authentic it doesn't feel like   a cheap fry at all very nice quality on these  definitely nice quality actually really good   okay now that i've got that out of my system  let's get a little bit more of this into my   system because again the quality is crazy  delicious on this right now we're gonna go   for one more bite and then we're definitely  getting into some wild sauce because i'm   very curious to see what the heat level is  going to be hang on let's go for another one so tasty and flavorful i think what i like the  most about this is it's got a flash fry type of   texture to it there meaning it's not overly  breaded not overly fried not overly greasy   so you're getting a nice juiciness with the white  meat and a light fried coating on the outside   and it gives you ability to kind of respect  the fact that the bun itself has a little bit   more give itself there in terms of the textural  side it's a little tougher in terms of the bread   it's got a little bit more of a rougher top but  it's soft on the inside so when you combine the   softness with the roughness on the outside as  well and don't get me wrong the bun is not hard   by any means but it has such a give and take  type of situation with it there on top of it   being kind of like an eggy type of bread like i  said it's kind of doughy but i'm really digging   that just to kind of show you again it's got a  little bit more firmness to the overall texture   of it there so it feels a little bit leathery  just a little bit if i can say it like that   but when you combine the softness on the inside  with the actual nice juiciness and of course the   textural goodness from that chicken patty and  of course the crunch and snap and acidity of   the pickles you've got a lovely situation here  along with that little light mayo which i'm   not really tasting but guys even still a very  lovely situation all across the board so far   all right so as mentioned earlier you can get this  with wild sauce which is apparently a combination   of buffalo goodness and a little bit of heat  according to what they're saying here it's a   free drizzle you can actually add to this so  essentially this makes this a spicy variant   but naturally i wanted to give it a go just as  a little taste on its own so let's give this   a shot here and i've got that all in there  hopefully that stayed in focus it's probably   focusing on me but as you can see there we  go a lot of nice goodness right there let's   give it a shot with the wild sauce my first  time trying this over here let's give it a go mmm buffalo right away oh whoa it's got some  sizzle that's not bad oh yeah but guess what   daddy's prepared today like  i promised you i've got water oh wow that is seriously hot but you know what  because i love you guys and i'm a glutton for   punishment let's go for a little bit more of that  action this is a lovely situation just a little   bit more there wow very hot on this i'm glad  i got it on the side to kind of add on my own   because now i feel my voice is beginning  to go one more bite hang on mmm that's beautiful yeah this is taking my voice  out with a quickness right now so guys let   me give you another final shot here with a  little bit of that wild sauce action to boot   a very lovely situation on this one over here  and again the thickness of that chicken breast   is amazing and i gotta say when you pair up that  wild sauce with the thick cut pickles on this   one you're getting a nice combination of acidity  snap and crunch with a little bit of extra heat   so loveliness all around definitely don't sleep  on this one it is absolutely worth your time over   here at buffalo wild wings especially for $5.99  pretty solid so real it's $5.99 for a limited time   buffalo wild wings you know with the current  heated situation outside of my car right now   as well as in even though i've got the fans going  here right now that wild sauce is doing a number   on me big time i'm beginning to sweat like mad but  in the best most possible way because the flavors   that i was experiencing right now definitely  primo especially for $5.99 only lovely situation   so before i completely melt i'm gonna have to  give this all new classic chicken sandwich here at   buffalo wild wings a rock solid 10 out of 10 guys  this is a top tier chicken sandwich by far with a   price point to match i gotta say loveliness all  around like i've been saying all throughout this   review awesome flavors mixed in with some amazing  textures on the actual sandwich itself especially   because of that challah bread on top of it guys but  again the juiciness of that chicken the flash fry   like outer coating that it's got combines to  give you a beautiful chicken sandwich eating   experience right now and again when you combine  it with that wild sauce i would recommend getting   it on the side because it is absolutely heated but  even still delicious stuff guys totally delicious   stuff and for six bucks how could you not give  this a shot right i mean it's pretty awesome   all right so i got to say out of all the chicken  sandwich combos that i've reviewed recently   and believe me i've done a ton of them this is  definitely some of the best value right there it's   very close to popeyes in terms of what the actual  price point is for the sandwich alone at $3.99   for $5.99 you're getting a side of fries to go with  i haven't seen any other chain out there really   kind of push something like that that is actually  a very lovely situation and really is the perfect   price point i think with a side if you ask me  anything over $5.99 is asking just a bit much so   this is priced perfectly for what you get and the  quality is pretty good all right so i got to ask   you if you've got b-dubs in the area are you going  to be giving this one a shot and if you've already   tried it already what did you personally think of  it i'm very curious to hear your thoughts on this   one compared to all the other chicken sandwiches  that you've tried out there right now drop those   comments down below and definitely let me know  and with that this is Ian K closing out another   high quality foodie feature for you here on peep  this out reviews bringing you brand new content   every single week here on my channel so while you stay  tuned for that next review coming real soon in the   meantime stay frosty yeah i'm probably gonna have  to swing on back to b-dubs in the not-too-distant   future to check out some of their other chicken  sandwiches because with this one being the high   water benchmark based upon my experience right  now i can only imagine whatever else they've got   on the menu being just as good if not better  which is kind of hard to think it's possible   all right guys until next time i'll talk to you  soon hey thanks for checking out another one of   my reviews but just in case you didn't see the one  before this one you can find it right up over here   along what i think youtube's going to recommend  for you to check out as well as always i think   you'll
