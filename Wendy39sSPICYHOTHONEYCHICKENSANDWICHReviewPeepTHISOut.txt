 hey everyone welcome or welcome back to the  channel it's Ian K where today i'm over at   wendy's to take a look at their latest limited  time only promo that looks to be bringing the heat   so let's see if it does just that by going  in on their all-new spicy hot honey chicken   sandwich stay tuned because it's up next welcome  to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty well i guess apparently not only is this new  chicken sandwich here wendys is supposed to   be kind of heated apparently it's very sticky as  well just by unwrapping this i instantly got some   of the sauce on my fingers and it is very very  sticky so guys without further ado here we go   the spicy hot honey chicken sandwich  over here at wendy's and i gotta say guys   not bad in terms of the presentation the chicken  filet is looking pretty good and overall i'm   digging those crispy pickles on top all right  so let's break this one down from top to bottom   starting off with that premium bun and underneath  it it looks like we've got a few of those crunchy   pickles guys i'm really digging the way the  fried appearance is on those and as we pan down   lots more of them to go with the applewood smoked  bacon and the pepper jack cheese that's on this   guys this is actually looking pretty nice and  naturally that's all sitting on top of their   spicy white meat chicken breast filet fried  up to a crispy golden brown i'm definitely   digging that presentation as always underneath  it looks like we've got more of that hot honey   sauce but guys it's all about the chicken  it's all about the quality of that sauce   and i'm really digging the overall appearance of  those crunchy pickles they do look pretty cool   yes sir i'm sure a fan of fried pickles guys  these actually look really really nice and i   guess it's got to be a fast food first and wendy's  is jumping out the gate with it i've never seen   these on any other fast food sandwich out there  but the crispiness of them is looking on point   guys just to kind of show you a little piece of  one right there let me just try this real fast oh yeah salted too wow that is very flavorful  already i think it bodes pretty well for the   sandwich right now all right so let's  get into giving this one a go guys it's   the all new spicy variant of the hot honey  chicken over here at wendy's let's do it mmm-hmm all right right off the break the chicken  is a little on the dry side guys initially   everything else is really upfront in flavor  there is some sweetness to that hot honey sauce   and i got to say guys the steam is beginning to  pick up right now that's a nice sizzle hang on oh yeah and i think that's dovetailing in with  the spiciness of the chicken itself but guys   the flavor of the bacon and those crunchy pickles  are the highlight with this one i'm not tasting   any pepper jack on here at all even though  it's kind of there for show i guess and to   hold everything together but guys the highlight  is easily those crunchy dill pickles on the top   and the chicken itself very very nice overall  so far but a little on the dry side so that's   where the hot honey sauce is kind of picking up  with the moisture at least in that department   but with the applewood smoked bacon the  smokiness that i'm getting from it and the   saltiness of those dill pickle chips guys which i  actually have a few that are actually here in the   in the package here in the wrap let's see if i  can try and focus that in there it's probably   not gonna there you go guys these are actually  really fun to look at and fun to eat as well i love the crunchiness to them and  their elevated saltiness on top of it   salt equals flavor and this is definitely doing  a pretty good job of adding a lot of nice flavor   overall to a very cool sandwich over here  although heated at wendy's let's keep going in absolutely well not only you're gonna get the  sizzle with this one here no matter what version   of this chicken sandwich you get with that hot  honey sauce it's definitely adding elevated   sweetness on top of it and i have to say what that  kind of reminds me of is when it combines with the   bacon it's almost like a candied bacon situation  so you're kind of getting some brown sugar like   flavor that's what it's kind of tasting to me and  that combines pretty beautifully with the crunchy   dill pickles on this one guys and naturally with  the size of the chicken not being too bad i just   wish it was a little juicier but still a very  flavorful chicken sandwich nonetheless well it   looks like i think we've got the makings of  a standoff between wendy's and carl's jr and   hardees with their hot honey chicken sandwiches  as well guys it's a very different type of sauce   but it's elevated in sweetness naturally and the  heat is absolutely there take a look at some of   the reviews i've done over carl's jr with that  playlist popping up on your screen here right now   this is a nice alternative and of course it's  got that wendy's quality of the chicken so   very lovely in that department all right  so let's go for another couple on this one   guys i gotta tell you i'm so glad that i  actually have some water here just in case and i know some of you guys are gonna say  you know water really doesn't do anything   to you you really want to have milk or something  like that i'm not down with drinking any type of   milk with a chicken sandwich so naturally a  little bit of extra moisture from the water   in my mind it's telling me it's doing something  good but even still i'm getting a lot of nice   sizzle in the back of my throat nonetheless  so spicy chicken on top of the spiciness   of that hot honey guys i have to say  it's pretty good let's keep going in and again what's really making it for me are  these crunchy dill pickle chips these are really   nice i'd love to try this on a burger guys but  they are very very flavorful the saltiness is   definitely up there but they taste so nice because  i love pickles anyway and these are really good   definitely a major add-on with this one it  really elevates the overall game because of the   added saltiness anyway but it balances smoothly  with the flavor of the bacon and of course the   chicken pepper jack cheese not really seeing  it i know you guys can probably see it right   there underneath the bacon it is placeholding  everything together it is what it is but guys   a very tasty delicious chicken sandwich over  here at wendy's and i would expect nothing less   from one of the kings in the game when it comes  to the cluck cluck you already know what it is and   i'm not talking about jack in the box all right  let's go for one more bite on this one before   we wrap the review up with the rating coming up  next but guys again i'm so glad to have checked   this one out and considering you can also get  this in grilled and their classic filet as well   how could you not want to go full on and do spicy  and experience everything as i think it's meant to   be especially with that hot honey sauce pretty  good one more bite we'll close it out hang on well it's not the juiciest chicken patty i've had  over here at wendy's but it's not bad either and   when you combine it with all these awesome promo  ingredients i have to say guys i really hope those   crunchy dill pickles stay around or they're used  on something else this is a very nice add-on and   it goes amazing with the crispy chicken again  another amazing quality effort from wendy's in   the bacon department always on top of a very solid  promo sandwich very good alright so with that said   i'm going to have to give the new spicy variant  of the hot honey chicken sandwich over here at   wendy's a rock solid 9 out of 10 it was almost  perfect if the chicken itself was a little bit   juicier but all the flavors are very distinct  on that guys you can really taste pretty much   everything all in one bite with the exception of  the pepper jack cheese which i think again is just   there for show as well as to hold things together  but as it stands i would easily rock this one   again and at $5.99 it's not a bad value definitely  a top-tier chicken sandwich as always here at   wendy's and this one is no exception okay so i've  got one specific question outside of the usual are   you going to be giving this one a shot because  again like i always say if you've made it this   front to the review i'd venture to guess you're  probably going to do me a quick favor drop some   comments down below if you've tried any of the  carl's jr or hardees variants of those hot honey   chicken sandwiches how do you think they compare  overall to the new one over here at wendy's   drop those comments down below and definitely let  me know and with that this is Ian K closing out   another high quality foodie feature for you here  on peep this out reviews bringing you brand new   content every single week here on my channel  so while you stay tuned for that next review coming   real soon in the meantime stay frosty you know  i gotta say if this sandwich didn't have those   crunchy dill pickles it would still rate pretty  high up there guys because like i said the quality   is pretty banging on it but with the addition of  those crunchy dill pickles it's instantly through   the roof solid stuff and again i would love to  see those on a burger wendy's what do you say   all right everyone until next time i'll talk to  you soon hey thanks for checking out another one   of my reviews but just in case you didn't see the  one before this one you can find it right up over   here along what i think youtube's gonna recommend  for you to check out as well
