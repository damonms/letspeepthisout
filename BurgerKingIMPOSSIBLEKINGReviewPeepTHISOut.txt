 what's going on everyone it's Ian K and welcome  or welcome back to the channel where today i'm   over a good old bk because it looks like their  latest king burger is about to do the impossible   that's right and you already know  it's the all-new impossible king so   stay tuned because it's up next welcome to  peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty well this is looking and smelling pretty  familiar guys and of course i'm going   to explain so feast your eyes on it let's get  started it's the impossible king here at bk very   tasty looking cheeseburger guys and i have to  say i am very excited to get into this right   now it's looking really really nice let's pop  the top of the sesame seeded bun and get started   and as you're going to see as we pan down here  basically it's just ketchup mustard onions and   pickle on top of an impossible plant-based  patty looking very familiar to the regular   single quarter pound king but with that swap  out of the impossible meat guys and i gotta say   very very nice i wonder why they haven't done  this sooner but i'm glad we're doing it now   and as i was saying earlier not only does this  look familiar and of course smell familiar   of course it's a doppelganger for the original  single quarter pound king and the funny thing is   i actually did the double variant of that  way back in the day and this is looking   just like that i have to admit the combination  of that impossible patty kind of subs in for the   meat pretty nicely with this one and again it  looks pretty cool it looked pretty chargrilled   and as you can see there pretty nice indeed so  let's not waste any more time guys let's confirm   the goodness hopefully with this one it's the all  new impossible king here at bk let's peep this out wow right off the break the pickles are jumping  out of me with this one guys along with the   creaminess of the cheese and the snap of the  onions and then you get into the mouthfeel   of the impossible patty itself and  guys it really is very similar to meat   considering on its own it doesn't really  taste like burger to me naturally but when   you mix it with the normal ingredients  that you would get on a cheeseburger   it begins to play with your head just  a little bit and this is a very good   thing because the quality is pretty tasty it's  classic bk let's keep going in guys pretty nice yeah this really does feel like the single quarter  pound king guys and like i said all the classic   flavors of bk on the outside of that impossible  patty is doing wonders to play with my head   here right now this is really pretty tasty the  creaminess of the cheese and i love the acidity   snap in the crunch of the pickles and of course  the onions to go with and naturally the mustard   in the ketchup just a very large cheeseburger  naturally with that familiar burger king flair but   plant-based pretty nice and again i'm kind of  wondering why they waited this long to give   this one a shot and naturally i'm glad that it's  here and technically even with the current single   quarter pound king available you can pretty much  swap out the patty extra and then just pretty much   have the exact same thing but now you're getting  an official marketing push to promote this one   considering it's basically on like a two for  one right now that's actually a pretty good deal   as well because on its own maybe just a little  pricey you're better off getting the two for one   but very tasty on this one guys very tasty indeed  let's go for another couple on it real quick i got a nice hit of that flame grilled goodness  of the patty with that one guys and i have to say   again it really is pretty nice and considering  it doesn't quite look like a burger i mean it   kind of does especially when you look at it from  the profile shot right over there on the inside   just a little bit different but when you  combine it with all the other goodness   on the inside of this one naturally with the  pickles the cheese the onions the ketchup   everything else this one has it really does a  lot to really kind of say guys this is the single   quarter pound king if you actually blindfold  somebody and give them a shot of this one and   the regular one i don't think you'd be able to  tell the difference with this one guys because   like i said the flavors are very very similar  and that's thanks to all the toppings on this one   which again are part of the single quarter  pound king in general so pretty tasty on   this one let's go for one more bite we'll wrap  the review up with the rating coming up next   but a very fun outing checking out the  doppelganger to the single quarter pound king   featuring impossible meat pretty tasty  one more bite we'll close it out hang on yes sir you gotta love a nice big cheeseburger  guys and considering this one is actually   doppelganging very nicely for that with that  impossible patty i have to say i am so glad to   be giving this one a shot right now because it's  hearty it's got the flavor that i know from bk   and it's plant-based on top of it so another great  alternative to have on the menu officially without   having to do it on your own outside of that pretty  cool so with that said i'm going to have to give   the single quarter pound king doppleganger aka  the impossible king a pretty solid   9 out of 10 guys like i said this really simulates that burger  pretty nicely with the addition of the impossible   meat patty all the combinations of the flavors  are the same with the addition of the plant-based   patty really kind of subbing in for that meat  which really works very very well so like i said   it's nice to have the option without having to  do it on your own you can just ask for it now the   impossible king very solid and the fact that it's  on a two-for-one promo you can't beat that pretty   nice all right so chances are if you're a fan of  impossible meat you've most likely already tried   it in their impossible whopper which i reviewed  way back in the day when it first came out take   a look at that review jumping up on your screen  right now if you want to get refreshed on that one   with that said now that this is officially  available on the menu as the impossible king aka   the doppelganger for the single quarter pound king  how excited are you to give that version of it a   shot drop those comments down below and definitely  let me know and with that this is Ian K closing   out another high quality foodie feature for you  here on peep this out reviews bringing you brand   new content every single week here on my channel  so while you stay tuned for that next review coming real soon   in the meantime stay frosty all right now that i  think about it i should have gotten a double all   right everyone until next time i'll talk to you  soon hey thanks for checking out another one of   my reviews but just in case you didn't see the one
