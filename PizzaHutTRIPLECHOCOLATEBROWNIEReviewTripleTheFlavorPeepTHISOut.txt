 what's going on everyone all right i'm back  on over at pizza hut this time to check out   yet another dessert off of their menu that  honestly looks like it's going to be three   times the fun but the question is is it going to  be three times the flavor well stay tuned because   the triple chocolate brownie is up next welcome  to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty all right so welcome or welcome back to the  channel it's Ian K and guys literally in my hot   little hand right now it's literally burning as  we speak i've got it for you here we go with the   triple chocolate brownie feast your eyes on this  guys this is looking absolutely decadent freshly   baked goodness in your face here right now and  the smell in my car is absolutely aromatic with   chocolate this is looking awesome all right  so what we've got here looks to be a very   rich brownie freshly baked with a combination of  semi-sweet chocolate chips dark chocolate chips   and cocoa guys a triple threat of chocolate with  this one and you can definitely smell it in the   car there is a massive overload of that chocolate  goodness and if you're a chocolate fiend like i   am you already know this is going to be pretty  amazing i have a strong feeling the presentation   alone is already selling me on this one big time  and hey you can't fade the fact that this is   freshly baked that makes all the difference in the  world guys and literally like i said earlier in my   hot little hand this thing is burning i've got  napkins under my hand right now to keep my hands   safe it's not doing very well in that department  all right so let hopefully the good times roll   right now i'm going to do a little surgery and  we're going to pull one of these pieces up here   real quick let me just cut a chunk of this off  here wow this is very soft very gooey already   all right i got to do this carefully this is very  gooey very chocolatey and it's absolutely falling   apart already guys look at all of the chocolate  with this look how deeply rich that actually   looks the batter is looking pretty amazing it's  super dark the cocoa has a lot to do with that   of course the dark chocolate chips as well  and the semi-sweet goodness right there on   the very top for the light brown action  guys this is absolutely beautiful right   now just look at that action let's give this  a shot guys it's the triple chocolate brownie   literally triple chocolate right now in my  mouth here on peep this out reviews let's do it oh whoa crazy dense crazy thick oh my god  heaven guys absolute heaven right now mmm man   i'm just going to keep showing this to you because  guys this is so gluttonously delicious right now   just look at that action my first time trying  this over here baked to perfection just look at   how it shimmers on the very bottom that is just  a beautiful situation of chocolate goodness very   thick very rich and a nice combination of those  three chocolate types just delicious stuff all   around yeah i had a feeling this was going to  be pretty banging because after checking out   the quote-unquote ultimate chocolate chip cookie  recently over here which you're probably seeing   jumping up on your screen here right now i knew  i had to come on back to give this a go because   guys i love chocolate i just love the denseness of  it and a brownie on top of it especially during a   rainy day right now probably the best time  to have this type of thing as well as pizza   as far as i'm concerned this is just crazy good  let's go in again this is so freaking delicious that is so delicious right now i  can't stop saying it it's so delicious   yeah this is straight out blowing my mind  right now with the amount of chocolate in   this and just to give you another idea of how  soft this is i'm just going to pull this apart   for you guys look at that it is beautiful this  is really heating up my hands pretty nicely still   as i'm getting into this but the experience is  absolutely heavenly absolutely luscious the amount   of chocolate on this is absolutely off the chart  and i'm totally digging the combination of all   three of these chocolate types together they're  not overwhelming each other it's just a beautiful   marriage of everything together and it's so gooey  let's go for another couple of bites guys but this   is such a high recommendation to go for well worth  the $6.99 for this well worth it let's go in again yeah those semi-sweet chocolate pieces on the top   those chips go amazing with the batter it's  so dense and so rich and again guys like i   said for $6.99 you're getting a very solid portion  with this as well this is a very very heavy tray   and it really goes a long way super dense on top  of it and just an overall beautiful situation so   let me run this one out with one more look at this  one before we get into one last bite but guys a   beautiful situation again i can't stop saying  it there's so many ways that you can actually   go into this depending upon how you cut it but  the square way is actually the best way if you   ask me just to kind of keep it together you can  kind of see there it's trying to hold its own but   guys this falls apart very easily just a lovely  lovely lovely situation let's go for one more   bite and we'll finish this review out with the  rating coming up next banging guys truly banging hands down one of the best brownies i think  i have had in a very very long time the   combination of those three chocolate types guys  with the semi-sweet the dark chocolate and the   cocoa together an absolute triple threat for your  taste buds i gotta say this goes amazingly well   and again baked to perfection that freshly baked  goodness and of course with everything you're   seeing in the tin here right now just something  very decadent and an easy recommendation a banging   treat for sure over here at pizza hut absolutely  so jumping right to it i'm
