stay frosty hi what can we get for you yeah peep this out can i get that new prime rib and cheddar angus stick burger just the burger by itself and that's it okay would that be all for you yeah and we're gonna go for the other third pound version of it that'd be awesome okay it'll be $7.82 at the window thank you great thank you all right so it looks like a lovely meat on meat situation that carl's jr likes to do with their promo burgers once in a while pretty nice yeah how you doing today good my friend good hey question have you tried this new burger yet uh i haven't actually no it looks pretty good yeah all right you can't beat meat on meat with a cheese sauce you know I'll have to try it out today yeah for sure man thank you thank you brother stay frosty we'll see you buh bye alright guys let's peep this out it's flavor lit by fire here at carl's jr as we get ready for some black angus beef goodness with their all-new prime rib and cheddar angus thickburger and already i'm just a little concerned with the size of this one guys it's looking a little small right there but the brioche bun is absolutely starting off in the right direction that's definitely looking pretty good let's take a look underneath it alright so here comes the cause for concern there doesn't seem to be a lot of cheddar cheese sauce you really can't see too much here i think they went a little light on me today and with the sliced prime rib it's also in the light department as well so the meat itself does look pretty decent i have to admit and that's all sitting on top of their popular third pound 100% black angus beef patty and i gotta say that's looking really good as always really really nice situation there underneath it we've got some marinated grilled onions and there's a decent amount but overall guys i have to admit the main stars of the show with this are a little on the light side with that prime rib and cheddar cheese sauce let's just see how the flavor goes on this one it's the prime rib and cheddar angus thickburger here at carl's jr let's peep out this flavor all right so i'm gonna hold a good thought for this one right now because i have a feeling the flavor is gonna be there at least in the black angus beef department here at carl's jr it's always a tasty situation but for the main stars of the show on top of that that prime rib is looking a little on the light side although it does look pretty decent but guys nearly non-existent cheese sauce just little specks it looks like there i'm a little disappointed already let's just give it a go but before i get started and like always if you guys are fans of high quality delicious looking food reviews make sure to hit that subscribe button down below and don't forget to tap that bell icon so you can be notified as soon as brand new content drops every week guys the prime rib and cheddar angus thickburger here at carl's please be good at least in the flavor department let's do it well one thing this definitely has going for it is lots of beefy flavor you can really tell the difference between that prime rib and the black angus beef they are very very distinct it's got a little bit of a nice char on the burger obviously there because it's charbroiled but guys really really delicious overall and those marinated onions are really singing with it so naturally the combination of the grilled marinated onions and that beef is going to be awesome and when it comes to the prime rib it's not too bad again i just wish there was some cheese to go with it there but take a look at the prime rib it is not too bad guys in terms of the cut here a little bit more of the well done it's not nearly as red as i would like it as traditional prime rib is but it's a fast food burger but guys not bad tender soft juicy a little bit of an oven-baked flavor on that meat actually it's actually very distinct compared to the charbroiled beef here let's keep going wow those marinated grilled onions are really beginning to stand out as i'm getting further into this burger they have a light sweetness to them and the oiliness is actually adding to the overall flavor of the black angus beef those are the dominant players with this one and then you have the prime rib coming up on the back end with a little bit more of that oven roasted type of beef flavor it's decent but guys the cheese is non-existent it really is that's so disappointing right now you know had this just been the prime rib angus thickburger that would have been perfect because it really satisfies those components pretty easily with this and when you add the marinated grilled onions on top of it that's just a beautiful combination with the meat anyway but guys the fact that there is no cheddar cheese flavor that i'm really getting with this there's a little bit of light creaminess for the little bit of cheddar cheese sauce that's there but there's nothing pronounced to really stand out and that's a bummer because i think had this had just a little bit extra on top of it it could have really added to the overall flavor profile of what this is but as it stands it's really just a beefy burger and there's nothing wrong with that when you're advertising it as cheddar though you gotta have cheddar cheese sauce let's go for another bite yeah definitely a nice beefy situation and like i said at the top of this review carl's is pretty much known for having a lot of meat and meat types of burgers in their portfolio i've done a whole bunch over the years take a look at that playlist popping up on your screen right now for proof of that there's lots of goodies on the inside and i've done so many in the past very very well this one i think had had just a little bit more cheddar cheese sauce would have been a nice combination but that main star of the show on top of the prime rib is just not here for me so what i've got is a very very tasty beefy burger missing a component that i was really looking forward to because like i said in the drive-thru when you heard me meat on meat with a cheese sauce how bad could that really be well it's bad because you don't have a cheese sauce really that i could taste with this it is what it is let's go for one more bite we'll finish this one out after the rating but guys like i said it is what it is well let's just do a 360 on this one because why not here i thought having a burger diaper was going to be because there was going to be a lot of cheese sauce here but well not today but as you can see it's a very tasty black angus beef burger that carl's is known for and again with the prime rib action on top not a bad meat on meat situation those grilled onions are really saving this one at least in the point category guys it's still flavorful may have to come back and get this one with some cheese sauce like it should have been the first time just saying well i think you guys know that old saying you don't get a second chance to make a first impression and like all of my reviews i do have to grade them as i get them so with that said i'm gonna have to give the prime rib and cheddar angus thickburger here at carl's jr just a slightly above average 6 out of 10 guys this could have been so much better had i had just the cheese sauce as they advertised maybe a little bit more of the quantity of that prime rib but overall it's just a very solid beefy burger with some great grilled onions but it's missing a key flavor component that really could have elevated the profile of this one overall pretty much into the clouds i have a feeling much less being a little bit closer to the picture would have been nice as well but guys like i said earlier it is what it is all right so do me a quick favor it's time for you to tell me what it is drop some comments down below did this actually look enticing to you even without the cheddar cheese sauce technically and are you excited to give this one a shot drop some comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K closing out another high quality foodie feature for you here on peep this out reviews bringing you brand new content every
