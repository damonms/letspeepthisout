 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty what's going on everyone and welcome to the  channel where today i decided to hit up my   local papa john's to take a look at their  latest promo which looks perfectly timed for   the start of football season and since you  clearly know the title to this review guys   let's just get into it feast your eyes on what  i've got here here we go with the football pizza   a very familiar looking sight here considering  it's basically a pepperoni pizza but guys   it still looks pretty tasty let's break this  one on down real fast all right so what we've   got here is an uncut thin crust pizza topped off  with extra pepperoni and plenty of melted cheese   and the cool thing about this one aside from the  obvious shape is right down the middle you've got   some classic pigskin stitching in the form of  melted cheese and the laces look really cool   i have to admit i'm totally digging that again  no shortage of the pepperoni and the cheese is   looking very plentiful on this one i gotta say it  looks and smells pretty fantastic for what it is   for a little extra garnishment with this one we've  got the trademark pepper the peppercini action   over here from papa john's along with a packet  of their special seasoning which i'm very curious   to try i've never actually had that here but guys  again coming back to the shape of this one it's a   very classic shape naturally it looks like a big  egg but in this case obviously it's a football   but it's covered with all the good stuff that  you'd expect from something like this and again   the laces look really cool right there in the  middle with that extra cheese pretty nice so there   you go it's the very simply named football pizza  from papa john's let's peep out this flavor yeah   i know it's just a thin crust pepperoni pizza but  i'm a sucker for these novelty items guys and this   looks really really cool especially with those  laces right there in the middle again i'm totally   digging that it kind of looks like the stuffed  crust type of cheese that they use for this but   they actually they have it melted down the middle  which is kind of nice so because this is uncut i   actually came prepared with a pizza cutter here  let me actually cut a piece off for myself but   i'm totally digging what this is and obviously  it fits with the theme of football naturally for   what this is too so very very cool with that all  right so there you go thin crust action pepperoni   and that's definitely thin crust guys take a  look at that very nice it's toasted very nicely   this is baked fresh right now it's very hot in my  hands but plenty of pepperoni plenty of cheese a   little bit of the extra cheese right there from  the stitching right there as well let's give   this a shot guys really quickly the football  pizza from papa john's let's peep this out oh that pocket of cheese from the  lace right there in the middle   very lovely but it's like you'd expect you know  i'll probably just pepper a few shots of this   pizza overhead for b-roll throughout the review so  you guys have something to look at while i'm kind   of talking the very basics with this one because  guys it's really just a basic pepperoni thin crust   pizza but still very tasty for what it is and with  plenty of cheese on here and again that pocket of   the cheesy goodness from the stitches that i got  right there in the middle for that first bite   was a lovely situation so depending upon  how you cut these that's going to be the   most sought after section it's right in the  middle i think but i'm totally digging the   quality of this one because it's made fresh very  crispy right from the oven let's keep going in and i gotta say this is kind of a fun way  to close out august it's kind of like an   in-between review with the regular content that  i'm currently working on right now so this was   something that's kind of cool to take a break from  and to give a go on and naturally speaking of   giving a go on let's try it with the special  seasonings here i'm very curious about this   no garlic dipping sauce to go with with  this one so we just got to make do with   what we have i pretty much got this  as is so let me lift this up again   and we'll do a little sprinkle sprinkle here  see if i can try and do this very carefully   okay there we go i'm dropping it all over the  place but it's all good hopefully that stayed   in focus if it didn't there you go there we go  i think we got more of the focus my focus needs   focus here we go let's give this a shot with the  special seasoning from papa john's let's do it spices and garlic that's good that's really good  actually let's go for a little bit more on this   guys keep that focus in there garlic and spiciness  to go with this it's very nice more garlicy than   anything else but it goes very nicely with  the pepperoni mmm wow that is really good   and because i have this last little piece  here right now let's go for a little bit more   keep that focused slightly let's knock it out all right and just to go for one more final shot  let me cut off another piece here really quickly   and i'll give you a look at what that is actually  before we wrap this one up but i gotta say guys   very very tasty here very tasty for what this  is all right and there we go and as you're gonna   see right there at the very tip of this one  is the sought after prize for this pizza by   far the stitches right there in the middle guys  it's a thicker cheese it bubbles up beautifully   and i gotta say it's a nice little surprise when  you get there depending upon how you cut this this   is gonna be the most sought after portion of the  pizza but again you have a nice crispy action in   terms of what you've got here a very decent crust  and i have to say plenty of pepperoni with some   nice flavor along with the special seasonings  pretty nice on this one guys pretty nice indeed   better ingredients better pizza papa john's  all right so as for a rating for this football   pizza over here papa john's i'm going to pretty  much base it on the concept because like i said   that's really just a standard thin crust pepperoni  pizza which is still pretty tasty but the way it's   designed is actually very fun so in that regard  i'll give it a solid 8 out of 10 guys it's   tasty it looks like the part and again the special  pigskin stitching that you're getting right there   in the middle the thicker cheese is a beautiful  situation so depending upon how you cut that   that's really going to be the nice accent to the  thin crust because then you have thicker cheese to   go with it and then naturally it's just a banging  situation overall considering it's a novelty   item i have to say it's right up there with the  jack-o'-lantern pizza which i reviewed not that   long ago actually but guys a very nice add-on and  i gotta say for a football party type situation   that's kind of a cool thing to have on the table  just to kind of set the tone because guys look at   what it looks like pretty cool all right so do  me a quick favor drop some comments down below   let me know what you thought of this particular  one and actually given the size of what it is   it's just a little bit bigger than a medium as  far as i'm concerned it's not quite a large not   quite a medium really but for $10.99 i think  it may be just a little bit up there in price   point but do you think it's worth it even still  because of how it looks drop those comments down   below and definitely let me know and with that  this is Ian K closing out another high quality   foodie feature for you here on peep this out  reviews bringing you brand new content every
