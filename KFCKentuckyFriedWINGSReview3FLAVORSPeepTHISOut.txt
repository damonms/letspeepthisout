 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty looks like the latest promo over at KFC is quote-unquote winging it in the best most possible way and since I've never had their wings before ever I'm definitely looking forward to trying them out so let's get right to it guys feast your eyes on the all-new Kentucky Fried wings and I've got the three main flavors across six pieces here outside of the unsauced version so for those of you who do not wish to have any sauce you can actually get these quote-unquote naked and that's actually a very cool thing starting off at the very end we have got two meaty lookin drumettes actually here available in both drumettes and flats but for the purpose of this review just to show you guys he will do a quick pan over looks like I've got mostly drumettes and those are my favorites anyway so really really nice Nashville hot starts it off here for you guys as you can see the familiar goodness all throughout and just so you guys know they actually flipped these seven to ten times in the sauce so you're gonna get a nice amount of coating and you'll see that as we go further on up here but looking nice and crispy really digging the size of these so far Nashville hot goodness let's move on to the next one we've got the honey BBQ this is the new one and as you guys can see it is loaded up very nicely as well all the nooks and crannies look like they're covered pretty well here and I gotta say the smell is really nice it does smell kind of sweet as I'm hovering over this one here right now and again a very meaty situation for sure moving on to the last and certainly not least option we've got buffalo how could you not have buffalo with wings right this is definitely looking pretty awesome and as you guys can see by the inside of the container it is lit up with that buffalo sauce again all the nooks and crannies and the smell as I'm hovering over this one is a nice strong buffalo aroma so really really nice presentation for these wings they look super meaty and I'm gonna get into each of them right now this is the all-new Kentucky Fried wings here at KFC let's peep out this flavor yeah this definitely looks and smells pretty amazing right now especially with all three flavors grouped together in One Bowl I got to say this is a very lovely looking Bowl right now guys it looks really really solid couple of things before we get started first and foremost let me send a huge shout out and thank you over to Adrianna and her team in my local KFC guys thank you so much for the advance look with this one and the amazing customer service as always very excited to get into this and the last thing as always if you guys are fans of high-quality delicious looking food reviews make sure to hit the subscribe down below don't forget to tap the bell icon see you could be notified as soon as new content drops every week all right I'm gonna start off with the Nashville hot because that's the obvious and give this a go here and as you guys can see I'm gonna hold this up let this focus in so you guys can hopefully get a nice look at all the nooks and crannies on this one this is a very beautiful situation and these wings are very meaty take a look guys this is a drumette very lovely situation for the amount of coating and hopefully a lot of meat on the inside let's dive into this one and again I'm loving the aroma mmm a lot of coating on a decent amount of meat mmm that's really good right off the break the Nashville hot is beginning to kick pretty nicely in the back guys wow that's actually very concentrated given that they actually flip these about seven to ten times when they're mixing them there is a lot of Nashville hot goodness on this one oh my god hang on one second that is really strong mmm nice very very nice guys the quality is pretty good on that I can see why the seven to ten times guarantees you're gonna get a lot of the coating on this one but I love the crispness of the outside of this wing it's a standard wing that you can pretty much find anywhere I would think but the quality of the coating on the outside is really nice it says signature KFC flavor but the extra crispiness is coming to be pretty nice let's go for another bite and go for a fast close up little trouble talking at the end of that one guys but the Nashville hot comes through very nice if you are a fan of Nashville hot sauce over here at KFC obviously it's gonna be the same flavor that you're used to but it really is nice having it on a wing like this and it's very thick and the meat is pretty solid on this one cooked very thoroughly and definitely a flavorful flavor and yes I said flavorful flavor I don't think I've ever said that in a review ever you never know how these things are gonna go sometimes I don't know it is what it is but let's go with the honey barbecue this is the new one and again let me focus this in here so you guys can take a closer look at that nicely sauced and I got to admit guys with the thickness of the breading on the outside and the meatiness overall I think I'm in for a treat with this one let's give it a go and again it does smell pretty sweet mmm it's actually very sweet this is actually more honey than barbeque to me but I love the overall flavor of it it is elevated in sweetness so expect it to be very very sweet but the overall flavor is delivering guys the honey and the barbecue is definitely there but again a lot more stronger in the honey department at least to me anyway let's go for another bite and go for that fast close up well as you can see plenty of that honey barbecue sauce is completely inside the nooks and crannies of this one very nicely but it is very very sweet like I mentioned guys so if you like sweet barbecue sauce you're gonna like this one but it's just a little bit more elevated for my taste but again the wing that it's on nice meat it's definitely a thick wing for sure and you got to admit guys it is definitely decent presentation this looks tasty well I hope you guys are digging all the close-ups of these wings here today guys because I'm having a lot of fun doing it for you and hopefully I saved the best for last with the Buffalo because this one is super strong right now not only a presentation but aroma looking really really nice let's get this one focused in for you as you guys can see a lovely situation as well and this is a fat wing for sure this is a big drumette right now loaded with the good stuff on the outside and again it's completely covered in buffalo sauce let's jump into this one I guess the real question is is it gonna be hotter than Nashville hot or something close to it let's find out mmm that is a thick wing mmm well this one definitely doesn't have the burn of Nashville hot but it's more of a lighter sizzle coming up on the back end and I guess maybe the reason for that is because Nashville hot is considered one of the flagship flavors here at KFC why would they want to overtake that with Buffalo but guys the Buffalo flavor is strong it's almost got like a Ranchy thickness to it but I got to admit guys a beautiful situation and as you guys can see again let me bring it up and focus it in lots of saucy goodness for you guys and as you can see there's a lot of coating on this one as well the meat is solid the size is solid and I'm really diggin the fact that the Buffalo is a lot thicker overall this is just a nice complement to the overall flavor of the wing itself well it was pretty awesome checking out these three flavors with these all-new Kentucky Fried wings with that honey barbecue being really the newest of the group and Buffalo pretty much is the standard that I think you've had pretty much everywhere although it isn't the thicker side I love the fact that the flavor was a lot stronger compared to everything else believe it or not above and beyond the Nashville hot even though that one had the hotter burn the Buffalo is the more vibrant of the three in my opinion with that honey barbecue coming up very close right behind but even though like I said earlier with that sweetness being a little bit more elevated I did like the thickness of the honey barbecue I think the quality was really good and the fact that it's on a very meaty wing with a decent amount of coating to equally match almost the amount of meat that's on that guy's it was a pretty lovely thing and the fact that they would drumettes on top of it like I said earlier again that is my favorite I was definitely enjoying this today very solid so with all that said and after the detailed breakdown on each of these flavors right now I'm not going to rate everything individually I think what I'll do is rate the overall experience of the wings it's my first time having them here at KFC because your mileage may vary based upon the flavors that I checked out so with that said I'm gonna have to give the all-new Kentucky Fried wings here at KFC are pretty rock solid 9 out of 10 and the only reason it's not a perfect 10 out of 10 is because some of the sauces do overtake the flavor of the coating of the wings themselves and that's actually not necessarily a bad thing because the flavor of the sauces is good but the only real flavor where it really stands out is the Nashville hot because that's more of an oil-based sauce to begin with so you can actually taste the coating a little bit better on that one where the others that have a thicker type of sauce it's a little bit more drowned out but overall guys the quality is pretty solid and they are hearty to bite into and as you can see by the presentation they look pretty awesome now the obvious question is do you agree with me drop some comments down below how excited are you to give these Kentucky Fried wings a shot over here at KFC and for those of you who may have had them way back in the day how excited are you to know that they're back on the menu and just so you guys know you can actually request them to be just drumettes or flats you may need to wait a little bit longer but it's nice to have the option pretty awesome stuff so definitely light up that comment section down below let me know it's up and with that this is Ian K closing out another episode of peep this out bringing you brand new content every single week here
