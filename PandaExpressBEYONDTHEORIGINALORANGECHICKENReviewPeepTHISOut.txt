 hey everyone welcome back to another high quality  foodie feature for you here on the channel where   this time i'm over at the panda express innovation  kitchen in pasadena california to go beyond the   original orange chicken and i'm super excited to  check it out so stay tuned because it's up next   welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty so they say imitation is the sincerest form of  flattery and as we go beyond the original orange   chicken what i've got in front of me here right  now is definitely trying its hardest to look the   part alright so what i've got here is a bowl  of their famous chow mein definitely one of my   favorites and on top of that obviously the main  star of the show the beyond orange chicken and   again the appearance is pretty striking because it  looks very very similar to what it's based off of   so what this is very simply is crispy beyond  meat pieces wok tossed in a sweet and spicy   orange sauce and the aroma is absolutely spot  on and with the plant-based pea protein subbing   in for chicken i gotta say you'd be hard-pressed  to tell me this wasn't orange chicken on its own   it does look pretty good in the appearance  department like i mentioned earlier not bad   and because i was curious i decided to get a  little side order of regular orange chicken to   see how it compares to this overall new version  but even still guys i think what we've got here   is going to be pretty tasty either way that sweet  and spicy sauce is lighting up my car beautifully   and i can't wait to get into this  so let's do just that we're going   beyond the original orange chicken here at  panda express let's peep out this flavor   yesir that sweet and spicy orange sauce  is lighting up my car big time and while the   appearance is pretty decent guys i have to admit  with the carefully formed pieces of the beyond   meat on this one it's looking just a little  bit different but even still very similar very   very similar all right so before i dig into this i  think it's only fair that i actually try a regular   piece of orange chicken first strictly just to  familiarize myself with that flavor it's been a   minute since i've had orange chicken over here  at panda but as you can see crispy goodness all   around these are definitely huge pieces they're  very thick lots of breading let's go in this first classic flavor that's timeless right there right  away this is the real thing guys definitely a   delicious situation and a famous entree over here  for sure as you guys can see we've got that white   meat chicken action on the inside and of course  the outside is breaded beautifully and doused   in plenty of that sauce loveliness all around  one more bite and we're getting into this next good you can't go wrong with this i'm  so glad i got this on the side as well   all right the moment of truth the beyond  meat variant let's give this a shot and again   take a look it looks like it's just a little  bit smaller in terms of the overall size of this   here and the coating is a little bit lighter as  well let's see if the flavor is going to deliver   though here we go we're going beyond the original  orange chicken for the 5 million time let's do it it's different but it's good hold on well it's  got the essence of orange chicken if i can say   it like that there's texturally something  noticeable with this one compared to the   regular version of their orange chicken  but the option is cool to have on the menu   especially with this entree but as you guys  are going to see here as it begins to focus in   take a look at that it's a little on the mushy  side just a little bit even though the firmness   of the coating on the outside is good but the  overall flavor is pretty much the same because   of the sauce that it's in so you've got the  sweet and spicy orange action but a little   bit of a different type of textural difference  as you're chewing it but guys like i said it's   great to have the option on the menu so far and  this is pretty tasty still let's keep going in   it's good it is you know i think what i'm noticing  the most about this after that first piece is as   that sauce begins to kind of disappear in your  mouth what you're left is literally the flavor   of the beyond meat itself which is not bad but  it's definitely not chicken that's the only thing   but it's interesting because texturally it's  got kind of the give and pull as you're chewing   chicken which is pretty nice but even still like  i said the essence is there so you know what let   me grab a little bit of chow mein and another  piece of the beyond meat orange chicken here   and i gotta say guys again it looks the part  it's just more carefully formed for the pieces   so you can kind of notice that right away  compared to the regular let's keep going in i do like this it's pretty tasty but i got to be  honest if you were to blindfold me and have me try   both of these together i have to admit i probably  know the difference strictly because of the type   of breading that's actually on the regular one  it just seems a lot more compared to it maybe   it's just the pieces that i got at the same  time but when you compare that with the little   nuggs supposedly that you're seeing here that's  kind of the standout so again this is a little   bit more carefully curated so to speak but the  essence is there and the flavor is for the most   part there as well it's just a little different  on the textural side especially towards the end   but even still the flavor is pretty banging let  me go for another bite of the regular real fast unmistakable come on that's really good  obviously i think you can tell i like the   original better but this is still pretty  nice so let me grab another piece again   they're a little on the small side  get another piece together here   as you can see very nicely done beyond  meat chunks let's give this a shot it maybe needs just a little bit more breading  on the outside to give it some more denseness   but the quality of the actual pea protein  goodness that it's based off of here   is not bad and like i said it  looks like chicken it really does   even though it's carefully put together so i  like it like i said but there's no replacement   as far as i'm concerned for the original  but this is still nice guys it is still nice well i gotta say i'm glad i gave this one a shot  and considering beyond meat is continuing to   invade just about every facet of the food industry  whether it's fast casual or fast food with their   product it's nice to see it work with the orange  chicken recipe here at panda and honestly guys   like i said the flavor is very reminiscent of  what you're used to and of course it's great to   have choices and this is definitely a solid one  especially if you love orange chicken so now that   i've gone beyond the original orange chicken let's  go for that rating overall i'm gonna have to give   it a pretty decent 8 out of 10 like i said  i think i can pretty much tell the difference if   i was blindfolded and even still with the pieces  being a little bit on the smaller side they need   a little bit more breading if they really want to  make it almost look like the original version but   even still the same flavor of orange chicken is  on display with that one it mixes well with the   chow mein that i got and obviously it's very  reminiscent of what it's trying to emulate and   like i mentioned earlier imitation is a sincerest  form of flattery that's doing a pretty good job   all right so now the obvious question do you  want to see this one go national at your local   panda express drop some comments down below how  excited are you to give this a shot and are you   a fan of beyond meat in general does something  like this really excite you knowing that it's   actually trying to be orange chicken drop some  comments down below and definitely let me know   and with that this is Ian K closing out another  high quality foodie feature for you here on peep   this out reviews bringing you brand new content  every single week here on my channel so while   you stay tuned for that next should be coming real  soon in the meantime stay frosty not bad on this   one panda not bad at all there's a fairly decent  amount of beyond meat on each of these little   pieces i think all you really need to do is add  a little bit more coating just to kind of beef it   up so to speak so it matches what it's trying to  emulate but even still the flavor is pretty decent   all right guys until next time i'll talk to you  soon hey thanks for checking out another one of   my reviews but just in case you didn't see the one  before this one you can find it right up over here   along with what i think youtube's gonna recommend  for you to check out as well as always i think   you'll find something like in both of them and  i'll definitely catch you in the next one see ya
