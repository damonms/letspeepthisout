 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty hey everyone welcome back to another high quality  foodie feature for you here on the channel where   this time i'm back on over at wendy's because with  fish season in full swing it looks like they've   brought back their annual menu favorite for a  limited time only only this time it's getting   a little bit of an upgrade yesir and i gotta  say it looks pretty good too feast your eyes on   the crispy panko fish sandwich here at wendy's and  already i'm digging the presentation of this one   guys i already love the thickness of that fish  fillet looking pretty dynamite so let's break   this one down starting off with a nice shiny  brioche bun and once we pop it you're going to   see there is no shortage of dill tartar sauce a  very lovely situation there looks like we've got   about three dill pickles to go with on top of  that and that's all riding high on top of one   large piece of lettuce and i'm really digging  that but separating the lettuce from the fish   itself appears to be a slice of american cheese  so not too bad underneath it you're going to see   the actual new upgrade that we've got here right  now no longer is this the north pacific cod we've   been upgraded to wild caught alaskan pollock guys  so a lovely situation there because of the crispy   panko goodness on the outside it's breaded up  nicely and fried to a crispy golden brown and   not that there needs to be any more tartar sauce  on the bottom because there isn't it's all on the   top guys but still the presentation is killer  on this and i have to admit that bread crumb   action is smelling beautifully fried guys a lovely  situation so without further ado let's see exactly   how this is going to be this is the all new crispy  panko fish sandwich here at wendy's let's do it mmm crunchy first off the crunchiness of the  pickles with the lettuce dovetailed right   into the crispiness of the fish guys and then  the dill flavor is coming through on the tartar   sauce this is pretty lovely so far and the  flakiness of the fish you're about to see   is pretty awesome let's go for another  bite guys very tasty very tasty indeed yeah this fish is pretty tasty guys and if  you look very carefully at the pickles riding   up above it there you're going to see that  the thickness is not too far off from that   i think that's from getting a lot of the snap  in the crunch because those pickles are awesome   the dill tartar sauce has got a nice tanginess to  it so that's adding to the overall experience but   guys those panko breadcrumbs are definitely a  standout a very nice fried situation right now   and i have to admit a very tasty fish sandwich  overall so far too and you know what it also   helps that we're on this nice little shiny brioche  style bun because guys the softness is awesome   it's super fresh there are no cracks to be found  here and just to kind of prove that to you again   very very fresh i've had actually some  experiences in the past where the bread   is obviously less than that but this is super  fresh all around so far let's go for another bite yeah that dill tartar sauce along with the  panko is easily standing out now above and   beyond the pickles believe it or not guys  there is so much of it on here right now   i'm really surprised nothing is leaking out  the back i guess maybe that has something to   do with the cheese kind of holding everything  together which admittedly i'm not tasting the   cheese at all i don't think it really needs to be  there maybe for advertising it looks kind of cool   but honestly cheese doesn't really need to be  on something like this at all especially with   the flavor of that dill tartar sauce delicious  stuff guys delicious and speaking of the dill   real quick and more specifically the dill pickles  i am really glad that there are three nice size   slices on here guys they really add just the right  amount of accent and flavor but the thickness is   on point so when you bite into this you're  gonna feel that crunch right away then the   lettuce and then right into the fish guys and  of course it's housed by that brioche style bun   that catcher's mitt goodness to get this into your  face in general is another nice round out for this   one because the quality is very very high on it it  really is so for about $4.49 here in my neck of the   woods this is not a bad deal let's go for one more  bite we'll finish this one up after the rating   but guys another fish sandwich that i've tried  fast food wise and i'm slowly being converted   to kind of enjoy fast food fish more often  let's go for one last bite we'll finish it up   all right so let's go around the world with this  one and as you can see again no shortage of tartar   sauce goodness guys that dill is a real stand  out with this particular version i'm definitely   digging that there the panko breadcrumbs around  that alaskan pollock is a lovely situation   but again that cheese is just non-existent it  really doesn't need to be there except maybe just   to hold it together but flavor-wise don't expect  to taste it just digging this overall guys a very   lovely situation indeed you know i'm trying to  think back to when i reviewed the north pacific   cod fish sandwich here at wendy's to kind of  remember if i really liked it or not i don't think   i liked it as much as i'm liking this because  judging by the thumbnail you're probably seeing   on the screen here right now my facial expressions  probably giving it away but even still regardless   of how i felt about that sandwich then this one is  easily something i'm gonna get again over here at   wendy's guys because it really is a nice quality  fish sandwich it really is so with that said i'm   gonna have to give the all new crispy panko fish  sandwich here at wendy's a rock solid 9 out of 10 like i said all throughout the review  there is no need for cheese to really be on   this right now because you can't really taste it  but everything else is an amazing situation guys   the softness that brioche style bun houses all  the goodness on the inside and again the panko   breadcrumbs on that fish fillet that wild caught  alaskan pollock really does stand out flaky   not super dry but just a lovely situation guys  and it's fried fish how bad could that be right   all right so i've got just one extra question  to ask you outside if you're going to be giving   this one a shot is wendy's your go-to when it  comes to fish sandwiches this time of the year   is that like your all-time favorite fast  food fish sandwich drop some comments down   below and definitely let me know and with that  this is Ian K closing out another high quality   foodie
