 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty it's flavor lit by fire here at carl's jr as we  go in after hours to take a look at their all   new bfc angus thick burger and i gotta say this  is definitely fitting the bill right there guys   with the thickness of that meat right there  in the middle well let me just say i am very   glad to be doing this one cheaters cam style  after hours over here at carl's jr and what   a burger to check out after hours as far as i'm  concerned guys this is super fun to do right now   a crispy disc of fried cheese sign me up right  guys the bfc angus thickburger let's do it yes first off right off the bat it's definitely  hotter it's definitely juicier that is probably   one of the wettest angus stick burgers  i have had over here at carl's jr since   i've been doing reviews here no lie that  is seriously awesome the cheese drippage   is in effect right now guys this is easily the  most cheese i have had on a fast food burger i   think ever i can just squeeze that slightly  and you can see that cheese coming out of   it so it looks like we've got some handheld  happiness from papa john's in store for us   with their all new philly cheesesteak papadia  and i gotta say this looks pretty nice guys   yeah glorious isn't the word the freshly made  pizza dough is easily the stand out of this   right now in the aroma department on top of those  peppers so i'm very excited to bite into this blast of cheese and meat already   the onions that's a lovely situation that philly  sauce along with the cheese they're using and this   gives it a nice very thick dense type of bite  and then you get the meat the cheese everything   together all in one it doesn't have the omarosa  roll i'm cool with that but i like the idea of   all the flavors melding together beautifully it is  just a lovely situation essentially a mini pizza   flipped over with a dipping sauce but guys a very  lovely situation what is not to like about this actually not the combo but uh peep  this out can i just go for a 12-piece   order of the beyond fried chicken by itself  i've tried just about every version of fast   food beyond meat that there is right now mostly  from carl's jr so i'm excited to see what the   colonel can bring to the table so let's go in  on it it's beyond fried chicken here at kfc   and right off the bat guys there is lots  of fried goodness wafting up in the car   here right now this is definitely smelling  pretty decent guys here we go beyond meat   and kfc together it's beyond fried chicken  please be good because it smells pretty good it's definitely got the texture of chicken believe  it or not but i'm getting a lot more of the fried   goodness of the coating on the outside than  anything else but i'm really digging the   presentation and it really is playing with my head  right now in terms of me having a chicken nugget   that's actually plant-based all right everyone  let's get it it's Ian K back again with another   high quality foodie feature for you here on peep  this out reviews cheaters cam style after hours   here at dunkin after dark to take a look at one  of their new halloween donuts and with the return   of their fan favorite spider specialty donut on  the menu let's just say there's something else   on the menu that looks just a little bit more  threatening it's the spicy ghost pepper donut   and i gotta say this is definitely a little off  the wall and if you're thinking this is a little   nuts guys you wouldn't be alone in that thinking  i'm kind of thinking the same thing let's do it well whoa guys do you see i'm filming here some  people have no respect for the process   wow here comes a little bit of heat that's  actually not bad i mean it's sweet but   i'm liking that actually the  strawberry sweetness is light   but the icing is rich so you're getting a little  bit of that nice sugary goodness on the top   and then naturally a little bit of the heat is  coming up let's go for one more bite real fast all right calm down just calm down celebrating  30,000 plus subscribers here on the channel by   heading on over to fat burger and i have  a feeling i'm really in for with this one   feast your eyes on a true beast of a burger this  is looking pretty awesome you know i gotta say   as glorious as this looks and as amazing as  this feels in my hands right now it's almost   a little embarrassing at the same time but it  has got some denseness i mean look at that man   i don't know if i can get my mouth around this  whole thing here but i'm going to try here we go oh so much beef this is straight out one  of the best burgers i have ever had guys i'm   getting everything in there with this one now  finally some of the egg on the bottom plenty   of that cheese a little bit of the pickles the  onions the lettuce the mustard but just a wall   of beef and truth be told i was a little careful  on the amount of toppings i wanted to put on   this because i wanted to try and have a nice  balance obviously of all the meat and cheese   but with everything else that this has got with  the onions the lettuce the pickles the mustard   a little bit more basic but then at the very  end having that fried egg in there as well   how could you not do that guys but the prep  on this one i gotta tell you is absolutely   glorious naturally there's plenty of seasoning  put on the beef patties themselves and with the   fried egg on top of it added to the mix it's a  beautiful situation and naturally with all the   condiments on top of that even you already know  this thing is going to be a gargantuan i was   blown away when i saw this being constructed  i knew this was going to be a little bit of a   problem to try and finish in one sitting and  i can already tell if you can do this in one   sitting god bless you because i'm telling you it  is very very dense you know peep this out can i go   for two orders of those new crispy chicken  wings please and that's it so just the two   uh orders of crispy chicken you got it do you want  any sauce on the side yeah just a spicy ranch it's   cool and you know what you know now that i thought  about it uh let's go for some diablo sauce please   okay $10.75 muffins great thank you awesome all right so chicken wings at taco bell i guess   it's not too much of a stretch considering  they've had crispy chicken in the past so   anything is possible right all right stay frosty  we'll see ya appreciate you buh-bye all right guys   let's peep this out so here we go with the new  crispy chicken wings currently in test here at   taco bell and i got to say guys this is looking  awesome already let me just say the aroma in my   car is lit up beautifully right now definitely  some fried crispy goodness for sure so crispy   chicken wings here at taco bell i mean who would  have thought right and just like you heard me   say in the drive-thru this is actually not the  first time they've tried something like this in   the past it was the naked chicken chips which  i actually tried when that was in test market   before they went national and i think there was a  crispy chicken quesadilla as well but guys this is   actually not too far of a stretch and taking  a look at these already let me just tell you   i am already digging the size of these things i  think they're going to be pretty good let's do it already the seasoning that it's got a little  bit on the saltier side but it mixes amazingly   well with the coating and i have to say these  things are meaty very warm right now because it's   bone in chicken but i'm absolutely digging the  quality so far guys and like i said the breading   is a nice combination ratio with the meat going  with this here this is actually really really   good let the insanity commence i think i'm in for  it it's the triple baconator here at wendy's and   guys this thing looks absolutely insane to  say this actually looks like a super beefy   super meaty burger would be an understatement  because in triple fashion i think this thing is   going to completely deliver it looks awesome oh  my god guys take a look at three quarters of a   pound of fresh beef in my hand here right now  this is looking really really insane before i   take the first bite on this one this looks really  really incredible why i waited so long to do this   right now i don't know but i'm glad i'm doing it  right now on camera with you guys in triple form oh my god so much beef one bite of beefy goodness lots of  bacon lots of cheese a little bit of ketchup in   there but man insanity pure insanity and  i didn't even really taste the mayo too much   either because of all the other flavor going on  with that one just the right amount of saltiness   from the beef the bacon the cheese everything  together and the juiciness and the hardiness of   it was completely off the chain i can easily see  why the baconator is a favorite without a doubt   hey everyone i'm back at it this time over a  little caesars for a little pizza pizza action   we'll scratch that a little pepperoni cheeser  cheeser pizza action so here we go with   the pepperoni cheeser cheeser pizza here  at little caesars and guys this actually looks   really really tasty i'm already focusing in  on that fresh mozzarella right there plenty   of pepperoni we've got some of that sweet basil  mixed in there as well yeah this definitely   looks and smells pretty awesome right now now  first and foremost let me start this review off   by simply saying look i know little caesars is  considered a value brand but i gotta be honest   you'd be hard-pressed to tell me this is a  value type of pizza that i'm having right now   i mean toasted parmesan asiago you've  got the pepperoni which is standard   but fresh mozzarella and sweet basil this  is going to be a lovely situation i think instant mozzarella that is nice yeah i'm really  digging that guys take a look at the cheese on   them that is a nice thick cut of fresh mozzarella  this is no joke nice quality on this one   and obviously with that toasted goodness in the  back we're not quite there yet can't wait to   give that a go but the pepperoni is amazing on it  the quality is nice nice toastiness on the bottom   right here so let's check out this crust in the  very back and take a look at this parmesan asiago   goodness right here it's nice and toasted as you  can see looking really really nice let's go for   a bite of that real fast mmm that's like a nice  breadstick nice pungentness from that asiago's   coming out and again that highlight in the back  is bomb this thing is made for dipping sauces   i only wish i got something to try that with right  now but a very nice combination of everything that   you're seeing here and i'm excited for this  one guys it's their cheeseburger pizza very   glorious presentation indeed starting off with  the obvious we've got ground beef american cheese   cheddar cheese shredded provolone cheese diced  tomatoes and onions and that's all on top of a   ketchup and mustard sauce which is on top of  a hand tossed crust a 14 inch large i've got   here right now a promo for $11.99 yeah this is  definitely a glorious side indeed guys and i   gotta say i'm really digging the amount of onions  on this on top of the vibrancy of that ketchup   mustard aroma in my car right now you can really  smell that pretty intensely when you flip the top   on this one and i gotta say it looks really really  fantastic presentation is pretty killer hand   tossed crust action this is looking really really  nice take a look at all that goodness on there   very vibrant in that aroma guys like i'm  telling you right now it really smells fantastic   let's give this a go it's the cheeseburger  pizza the all-new specialty here at domino's oh yes this pie is going to get destroyed but  i'm telling you that ketchup mustard sauce along   with the onions and especially along with that  beef is a lovely situation take a look at that   it is a really glorious presentation in terms of  the toppings and that hand tossed crust is nice   little brushed olive oil garlic goodness in the  very back there and hey with me not really being   a fan of tomatoes i'm not really digging the fact  that they're on here right now i mean for accent   it's really awesome but i have to admit what  this thing is missing and believe it or not i'm   surprised it doesn't have it because i think it  would be perfect is pickles a little bit of that   pickle the acidity the snap and just the overall  flavor that it would add would be pretty awesome yeah peep this out can i go for one of those  breakfast baconators just the sandwich by itself   and that's it alright go ahead and pull forward  I'll have your total at the window great thank you   yeah this thing looks really good a  combination of cheese bacon swiss cheese   sauce all kinds of other goodies there can't  wait to check it out awesome how you doing   how are you good good thank you we're just  waiting for some fresh eggs okay that's the   best way to do it i'm super excited about this one  right now it looks awesome there you go all right   very cool i'm excited i am up for this right now  super excited thank you so much i appreciate you   stay frosty we'll see ya bye all right guys it  looks like the hype is real let's peep this out   so wendy's is asking are you up for this well  you already know that i am here we go with the   breakfast baconator and guys the smell in the  car is definitely breakfast and i love it this   is really really a nice combination of goodness  here all right let me just say first thing i am   definitely not a morning person i mean it really  takes a lot for me to get up in the morning to go   for breakfast but when i saw that wendy's was  finally launching a national breakfast menu of   course i was more than interested because guys  it's wendy's i was very curious to see what they   were gonna offer and so far in the presentation  department i am definitely not disappointed this   does look pretty great here we go the breakfast  baconator brand new here at wendy's let's do it oh whoa well there it is and all its cross-section  glory guys a very lovely situation of a freshly   made breakfast baconator and i gotta say  again that breakfast sausage on the bottom   was really nice the grilled flavor is coming  through it's not greasy the flavor is on point   forget it the flavor of that one alone  i'm telling you right now this needs to   be on a regular burger in general i can only  imagine the combination of that 100% fresh beef   along with that cracked egg the swiss cheese  sauce and of course all the other melted goodies   the applewood smoked bacon i can go on and on  and on with this guys but you already know the   breakfast baconator is definitely bomb and  with that this is Ian K
