 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty here we go with another high-quality foodie feature for you with Ian K here on peep this out reviews this time over a good 'ol BK to go in on quite literally the OG when it comes to fast food chicken sandwiches guys feast your eyes on the appropriately named original chicken sandwich and judging by how this one looks it hasn't really changed too much in the 41 years it's been around now so underneath the bun we've got some chopped lettuce a little bit of mayo and obviously that formed piece of chicken the iconic look that this one's got to it there underneath it it looks like it's pretty much the same exact deal not too much going on there it's just the bottom of the bun but a very simple ingredients list and a very iconic shape if anything else let's see if the flavor is going to deliver on this one if it's gonna be reminiscent of what I remember it's the original chicken sandwich here at BK let's peep out this flavor yeah this one is definitely long overdue and considering all the promotional sandwiches I've reviewed over the years here at BK how could I actually not go back and do the original I mean this is the OG 1979 that was the year that ALIEN came out one of my all-time favorite movies actually so to have this one at 41 years old today and not have a review on the channel just yet until now I had to do this one so let's take another fast look at it here as you can see a very solid crispy piece of chicken and the iconic bun looking really really tasty so we're definitely gonna get into this as always

notified as soon as brand-new content drops every week guys since 1979 the original chicken sandwich here at BK the OCS let's do it well admittedly it's a little on the dry side but the saltiness is not bad and the light breading on the chicken is not bad either and as you guys can see it's fairly thick I mean it's definitely little bit of a hearty bite there I just wish that the flavor was just a little bit more juicier that's the only thing I mean a little bit more of a wetter piece of chicken would've been good this is just minutes old but naturally the iconic bun that it's got one thing I can tell you though I am NOT a fan of the chopped lettuce angle that they're going with this I know it's nostalgic they're not gonna change the ingredients but the chopped lettuce is not really really good with this I got to be honest the light Mayo is giving it just a little bit of moisture but overall a little bit of the saltiness I like but I just wish it was juicier that's really the main thing on top of it there so let's go for another bite we'll keep going with it okay so this really does feel like a huge chicken nugget which is not really a bad thing because I think the chicken nuggets a pretty much based off of what I'm having in front of me here right now so the quality of the chicken nuggets gonna be what you're getting with this one here for those of you that remember it and for me as a kid it's pretty similar to what I'm remembering now it's just a lot of bread as I'm getting further in even with that second bite but I'm definitely digging the shape it's definitely iconic for that regard but when it comes to the actual quality of the chicken it's just okay and as you can see it really does remind me of the regular chicken nuggets here at BK and that's not a bad thing but that quality is very similar and the taste is very similar as well you know it's funny and doing the research for this review as I usually do when I put my content together I actually found out that this sandwich was under a few different names in the past it was known as the regular BK chicken the long chicken the chicken Royale even and aside from coming out in 1979 it was part of about four or five other sandwiches at that time to target a specific demographic usually 18 to 34 year olds people who actually had a little bit more money to spend so BK was trying to actually up their profile just a little bit aside from burgers and this was a step in that direction and also just as a quick side note the bun that's actually used on the chicken sandwich was the same as the ham and cheese sandwich they had back in the day as well which was later changed to yumbo and I think you guys are probably gonna know what that is as well that actually came back a few times throughout the years but guys it's always been about the original chicken sandwich and this is really the only thing that has stayed it's iconic for a reason 1979 they advertise it on the packaging just kind of cool but as it stands just an OK chicken sandwich overall for what it is but again it's the nostalgic factor to keep it on the menu and actually I like it just for that reason alone let's go for another bite well I'm glad I can finally scratch this one off the bucket list guys and honestly it's been about 30 or so years since I've had one of these chicken sandwiches at least in this form because all the other ones I've done on my channel have either been the promotional ones or the brand new versions of the chicken they've got as well it's nice to know where the things came from it's nice to know the history lesson behind it actually and guys like I said it's okay for what it is it's pretty much an elongated chicken nugget on the inside of an elongated bun but guys like I said iconic classic because of the shape one more bite we'll finish this one out after the rating and then we'll close this one out so yeah it's not gonna win any awards as being one of the all-time greatest chicken sandwiches ever guys but it does score points because of the iconic nature of what it is and how it looks and that's really the main thing that's selling this one right now so for all of you guys who remember this one when you were younger and especially me 1979 a long time ago this is actually a very fun thing to check out and again that bun that bun that bun that bun the very iconic shape of it is really reminiscent of what this one is but not too bad so with that said I'm gonna have to give the long chicken aka the chicken Royale aka the BK chicken aww screw it just the original chicken sandwich here at BK a pretty decent 6 out of 10 guys you're hearing the word iconic thrown around a lot in this review and for a reason like I said it's the nostalgia factor of what this is and while it may not be the absolute best chicken sandwich I've ever had here at BK believe me the newer ones blow this one out of the water the fact that I'm trying this one after so long officially here in the channel I'm really glad to be doing it for that reason alone it actually is a pretty tasty chicken sandwich again very reminiscent of just a long chicken nugget on a long bun that's pretty much it but you know what I really wish they would switch over to leaf lettuce on just about all the sandwiches over here that would be a step in the right direction but we're gonna keep it the way this one is because like I said its iconic 1979 don't fade it okay now the all-important question have you ever had the original chicken sandwich here at BK I'm venturing against that most all of you have at some point but some of you may not drop some comments down below is this something that you've tried on the menu recently and if you have how do you think it stacks up to chicken sandwiches overall drop those comments down below definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K closing out another high quality foodie feature for you here on peep this out reviews bringing you brand-new content
