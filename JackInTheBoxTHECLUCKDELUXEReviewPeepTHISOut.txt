 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty all right everyone welcome back to another high  quality foodie feature here on the channel where   this time i ventured on back to jack in the box to  check out the other variant of their all-new cluck   sandwich and i gotta say guys this one looks to be  swinging for the fences in the toppings department   so without further ado let's go in on the  all-new cluck deluxe sandwich and already   this is not looking exactly like the picture  but it's still very very messy let's pop the   top of the brioche style bun let's take a look  underneath it well we've got a laundry list of   goodies here so let me just read it off to you  looks like we've got a decent amount of mayo we've   got some lettuce we've got tomato hickory smoked  bacon cheese and guacamole pretty much everything   but the kitchen sink and that's all sitting on  top of their all new crispy chicken patty guys   it's a thicker piece of white meat fried to a  crispy golden brown and it looks pretty good   on the bottom looks like there's nothing there  but honestly guys i don't think there needs to   be anything else there considering  everything on the top of this one   all right so let's see if all these flavors  are going to deliver in a very beautiful way   this is the all new cluck deluxe sandwich here at  jack in the box let's peep out this flavor well   as in true jack-in-the-box fashion we've got some  pretty slick marketing to go with and considering   the impact they're trying to make with their  all-new chicken sandwiches it pays to go big   right and actually jack is really doing that here  take a look at the box this is actually looking   really slick here the cluck deluxe this is supposed  to be just the right amount of crunch for you   and naturally they're hoping this is going to  rule the roost but obviously i think they're   counting on it to be hot and crispy at a bare  minimum but guys pretty slick overall and again   i guess nowadays you need to have some type  of marketing the foil packaging is pretty   much standard now everyone's pretty much doing  that but with this one you can have that because   this is just a ridiculously sized sandwich right  now it really is all right so before i bite into   this one let me give you another look at it here  there is a lot going on guys but as you can see   a lot of flavors even the tomato action is in  there i'm actually going to go on it with the   tomato here just because i want to get the full  round of everything but with guacamole spilling   out the back we've got bacon i'm so glad we've  got a little chicken sandwich diaper to go with   let's give this a shot it's the cluck deluxe  brand new over here at jack in the box let's do it whoa crunchy well i think i mentioned this  one had cheese during that initial close-up   and guys honestly even i'm not really tasting it  it really is helping to hold everything together   and i always say that's like the glue to do just  that but there is so much going on with this that   believe it or not once i got into that first bite  really heavy the chicken really jumped out right   away and then all the other flavors so that's  a testament to the quality of the chicken so   far because you think it'd be drowned out by all  the toppings but i'm digging it so far let's go   for another bite i'll give you a close-up but  so far i'm impressed and guess what all those   flavors are drowning out the tomato thank  god right thank god all right let's do it good wow the chicken is really delivering on  this one compared to all the other toppings and   i guess with all the toppings on here they knew  what they were doing when they put this together   but when you first see it it looks crazy because  you think you're not going to be able to taste   anything except all of that but still the chicken  is really standing out the creaminess of the guac   is pretty amazing and the light hickory smoke  of the bacon on top of it so far guys i'm pretty   impressed vibrant flavor is coming from a chicken  pretty solid you know so far i gotta say i think   what jack should do is really upgrade all of the  chicken sandwiches on their menu with this patty   because this tastes distinctly different compared  to all the other reviews i've done in the past and   you guys can take a look at the playlist popping  up on your screen right now for proof of that   but guys a delicious situation overall i'm while  we're talking about playlists and videos right now   in reviews you got to take a look at my original  review of the cluck sandwich on its own because   that felt distinctly different compared to what  i'm having right now so while i'm digging the fact   that they share the name there are two completely  different sandwiches naturally the other one had   like a mystery sauce or something along those  lines what was very tangy something very different   this is more traditional but with all the toppings  that you'd expect to find and say a promo burger   or chicken sandwich over here jack-in-the-box  but the quality of the chicken patty itself i   can't believe is holding its own with all those  flavors in addition to this so nice combination   and like i said the profile almost feels even  across the board but the chicken is the highlight   as it should be because that's their main  promo let's keep going in this is pretty tasty let me show you what i'm working with  here in the back guys i'm so glad i've   got this chicken sandwich diaper because it's  catching all the extra guac but as you can see   it's got a little light chunkiness to it and  overall the nice creaminess that it's adding   mixes so beautifully with the actual hickory  smoked bacon but guys everything else here is   lighting up beautifully and again the quality of  that chicken patty is banging i am really digging   this version of it and i really hope this one  sticks around for a bit it really is pretty solid   yeah i'm pretty shocked right now out of all the  chicken sandwiches like i said i've had in the   past this is easily tops when it comes to the new  version that they have right now and i'm really   digging the quality of it there like i said i  hope this promo sticks around because naturally   i think it would just elevate the game across the  board not just with the promo chicken sandwiches   naturally but just literally across the menu but  it's tasty it really is and hey you can't beat the   fact that it's crispy and crunchy on top of it all  throughout there so pretty solid on this one guys   pretty solid now real quick let me take another  quick bite of this one then we'll finish this   one up after the rating but guys as you can tell  pretty solid in the chicken sandwich game over   here jack-in-the-box especially with this upgraded  patty delicious indeed let's go in it's slipping   it's sliding thanks to the guacamole and that  mayo on the top we can't forget about that but   overall everything else here aside from the messy  factor is delivering in terms of flavor and that's   where it counts so be thankful you have something  to wrap the sandwich around you're gonna need it   or at least have plenty of napkins but overall  guys a nice situation when it comes to this new   chicken patty over here and jack you definitely  didn't cluck this one up this is pretty solid   order on ubereats postmates and grubhub well  they actually did cluck it up but in a good   way i think you know what i mean right all  right so overall i'm going to have to give   the all-new cluck deluxe sandwich here at  jack in the box a rock solid 9 out of 10 this is easily the version to get believe it or not over the other variant i have to admit guys   the quality of the toppings with everything  thankfully being all held together by that   chicken sandwich diaper in the back really really  shines the quality of the overall flavor of it   on top of the awesomeness of that chicken patty  just a beautiful situation and again the nice   crunchy juiciness of it overall it's just very  hearty and easily worth the $6.79 for that i got   to admit it's not bad in terms of the premium  what you're getting are premium ingredients   on top of a pretty premium piece of chicken not  bad and it's crispy and delicious come on all   right so you've probably made up your mind about  this one already but do me a solid and drop some   comments down below let me know if you're gonna be  giving this one a shot if you've got jack in the   box in the area and if you're actually a super  fan of chicken sandwiches how do you think this   one's going to compare to what's out there already  there what are your personal favorites drop those   comments down below and definitely let me know  and with that this is Ian K closing out another   high quality foodie feature for you here on peep  this out reviews bringing you
