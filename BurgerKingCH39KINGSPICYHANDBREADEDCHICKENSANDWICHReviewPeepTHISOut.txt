 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty hey everyone welcome back to another high quality  foodie feature for you here on the channel where   this time i'm over at bk once again to check out  another one of their all-new hand-breaded chicken   sandwiches and guys this one's looking to be  a little heated and not only a little heated   possibly a little oversized as well guys feast  your eyes on the hand-breaded spicy chicken   sandwich and i am definitely loving what i am  seeing here this is looking a lot bigger than   the classic version that i did recently and i  gotta say this is looking really really great   so breaking this one down from top to bottom it  looks like we're starting off with that shiny   potato bun as always let's pop it and take a look  underneath and you're gonna see there is plenty   of that savory sauce guys three deli pickles to  go with just like the classic variant and that's   all sitting upon their all-new hand breaded chicken  breast and as you can see not only is it looking   super crunchy it's got a special spicy glaze to go  with guys and i'm loving the presentation it looks   a little threatening a little spicy indeed but i'm  loving that red tinge underneath it it looks like   we've got more of that savory sauce and the bottom  of the bun but again guys the chicken patty this   time out is looking a little bit thicker than the  version that i just reviewed and i gotta say the   overall presentation looks pretty banging so there  you go it's the hand breaded spicy chicken sandwich   here at bk let's peep out this flavor yeah man  this almost looks like the actual advertisement   for it guys look at the thickness of the chicken  on this one and again plenty of sauce from top   to bottom the differentiating factor between all  the other chicken sandwiches out there is easily   going to be the sauce with this one aside from the  overall good looks i am thinking this is going to   be pretty banging and again three lovely pickles  on here on top of it i'm a huge fan of the pickles   on these sandwiches can't wait to get into it  all right enough talking because we're doing   it right now it's the all new hand breaded spicy  chicken sandwich brand new here at bk let's do it right as i went down into that first bite guys  the mouth feel is awesome right away the flavors   instantly jump out at you the saltiness of  that chicken patty is absolutely there now   the heat is beginning to pick up a little bit  it's got a little bit of steam action going   but guys flavor is awesome and as my mouth is  beginning to water even further as i get into   this right now let me go for a quick bite  again we'll give you a close-up guys this   is definitely the version to get so far i  am digging the spicy variant let's do it um did i mention there's three huge deli pickles  on this right now that was a little bit of a   struggle but a fun one really good yeah as you  can see by the gaping hole in the top i took   out one of those huge pickles and i'm really  digging the quality of those pickles as well   they're reminding me of popeyes instantly and  i gotta say they are awesome but as you can see   a very thick piece of chicken on this one guys  the breading is awesome and overall the flavor   is really delivering it really is man i'm having  so much trouble talking with this one because of   that spicy glaze but again the quality is pretty  awesome and like i mentioned in the last review   which is popping up on your screen here right  now the fact that the same company owns both   popeyes and bk it's really nice that they're kind  of cross-pollinating a little bit i think the prep   is pretty much going to be the same but guys  the quality overall is spot on with this right   now especially the spicy variant let's go in  for some more bites this is really really good i love the crispy outer coating on  this definitely ultra crispy like   they say on their foil pouches guys and  i'm really digging the quality of this as   well because it really does stand out and i  love the old retro logo from bk on here too   really really awesome on this and i gotta say guys  the quality again very very high i'm just so glad   the chicken patty this time out is a little  bit thicker than the last time and there was   really nothing wrong with that variant although i  gotta say this is a lot closer to like a popeyes-esque   type of height in terms of the thickness but  the quality is pretty awesome you're going to   hear quality all throughout the review because  that's what you're getting with this guys really   really good stuff all right a couple more bites  in this one because i'm so digging the outer coating   you can really taste the fact that this is  ham breaded in storage it's ultra fresh you're   going to keep hearing me repeat that all  throughout this review as well because guys   i'm really tasting the freshness on this right now  and this is not a knock against the other chicken   sandwiches they've had but the prep is definitely  better with this variant let's keep going in juicy too and on the real that's pretty hard to  do considering white meat tends to be a little   bit drier than dark meat naturally but for what  this is i gotta say the way that this is prepared   you can tell it was pretty much spot on it's  fried perfectly and i'm really digging that   outer coating mixing with everything in here again  the spicy glaze it's just enough to really kind of   keep you coated for a while but it's got some nice  sizzle to it guys a light burn but really really   nice flavor and speaking of flavor of course  you're getting a little bit of elevated salt   with this one because it's fried chicken but  at the same time the combination of everything   together the savory sauce the butteriness that  i'm getting from that a light mayo type of vibe   that i'm getting even though it's not tasting  like mayo that's going amazing with the outer   coating and obviously the acidity the snap the  crunch of the pickles all that good stuff guys   let me just keep showing this to you it is a very  very solid well-made chicken sandwich and as you   can see the quality here just speaks for itself  very very solid presentation with a thick juicy   chicken breast to go with so yeah i'm definitely a  fan of this variant and usually with all the spicy   variants of the chicken sandwiches that are out  there right now i tend to kind of lean that way   anyway because i just think it adds a little bit  more flavor-wise not so much heat per se but it's   just enough to let you know that it's there and  initially it may give you a little bit of trouble   up front if you're sensitive to that type of thing  but overall the quality of what you're going to be   getting after that is what they're selling with  this one here and again the hand breaded goodness   the overall flavor i love the way it looks  the chicken itself is very large this time out   and of course the right amount of coating the  fact that you're getting the pickles on top   of it and they're thick cut another lovely  situation mixed in with that savory sauce   and in the case of this variant the spicy glaze is  absolutely banging on it guys so for me personally   this is easily my favorite out of the two and i  gotta say guys a lovely situation because again   the quality speaks for itself on this one and the  outer coating is just delivering so one more bite   we'll close it up after the rating but guys a  very very solid entry into the ongoing chicken   sandwich wars now officially from bk in the game  with a winner this is really great one more bite so yeah a thick chicken breast action with  this one with just the right amount of   coating that doesn't overpower the quality  of the meat here guys and obviously with   the potato bun being what it is had i  wish it had a little dusting on the top   sure that would have been a nice touch but even  still the softness is delivering on this one it   sandwiches all the good stuff on the middle right  over here and as you can see with everything else   this has got a lovely situation indeed those  pickles are delivering the spicy glaze that   buttery savory sauce just a very very solid  chicken sandwich over here at bk absolutely   but again just a little bit more expensive than  i thought it was going to be and considering what   you're getting here i guess it's not too much  to ask for the price point but even still guys   very very good for what this is and an easy  recommendation to give a shot chances are you're   going to if you've made it this far into the  review so as for the score i'm gonna have to give   the all-new hand-breaded spicy chicken sandwich  here at bk a very solid 9 out of 10 the only   thing keeping it out of the 10 spot again is  the price point that's really the only thing but   even still what you're getting is gonna be ultra  flavorful and it's great to have an option from bk   pretty much everyone has got a chicken sandwich  now and there are some real winners and this   one is absolutely one of them solid stuff okay  so
