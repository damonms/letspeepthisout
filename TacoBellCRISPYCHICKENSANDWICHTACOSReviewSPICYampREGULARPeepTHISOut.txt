 what's going on everyone and welcome back to  another high quality foodie feature for you here   on the channel where this time i'm back on over  at taco bell to take a look at believe it or not   their entry into the ongoing chicken sandwich wars  that's right get ready for it it's their all-new   crispy chicken sandwich tacos i mean of course  it is right stay tuned because they're up next   welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty so here we go with the all-new crispy chicken  sandwich tacos here at taco bell and initial   first impressions this is kind of looking like  something off of their value menu they're a   little on the small side but even still the  chicken's looking nice and crispy and those   buns that they're sitting on a.k.a that flatbread  it's looking nice and soft so starting off on top   what we've got here is a soft piece of flatbread  and on the inside a crispy all white meat piece of   chicken marinated in jalapeno buttermilk and  their trademark bold mexican spicing and for   added crunch the outer coating is actually made of  tortilla chips so that actually looks pretty cool   finishing it off we have a little dollop of their  signature chipotle sauce and i gotta say guys   overall again this really does kind of feel like  a value menu item but the presentation does look   pretty cool and it looks like something really  tasty as a snack and if a little added heat is   what you're looking for you've actually got a  spicy version available which is the exact same   thing but with the addition of two jalapenos  so again a little snack sized piece of chicken   a fried piece of chicken at that with some really  cool little tortilla chips on the outside but even   still guys very cool for the gimmick of what it  is and of course it's folded to look like a taco   so let's see if the flavor is going to deliver  on these it's the all new crispy chicken sandwich   tacos here at taco bell let's peep out this flavor  yes sir very cool with that outer coating on this   piece of chicken guys but again it really does  feel like a value menu item but even still the   chicken is looking nice and crispy it feels  like a long chicken tender on the inside of   a piece of flatbread but even still very cool  for the gimmick of what it's trying to be but   again i'm looking forward to getting into  the flavor of it obviously so let's do just   that one more time it's the crispy chicken  sandwich taco here at taco bell let's do it crunchy mmm juiciness on that white meat wow  that is a hearty bite guys i gotta say that   is very satisfying to bite into and here i  thought this was gonna be just a little easy   three or four biter it's actually very thick  so naturally you're going to get a mouthful   of chicken with each bite in this because this is  really covered from end to end with the flat bread   pretty nice and toastiness in terms of the overall  flatbread itself it's got a little flour dusting   but guys the coating is really nice on the  outside of this chicken and the chicken is juicy   and you want it to be because this really  feels super fresh right now in addition   with the chipotle sauce adding a little bit of  heat to my situation right now considering how   hot it is outside even still guys i am  really digging this and again very nice   in terms of a snack size little gimmick  for what they're trying to do with this   but even still it's a fried piece of chicken on  the inside of a piece of flatbread with a little   bit of heated chipotle sauce that's pretty much it  but i do like it let's go for another bite on it let me show you this one one more time before  we get into the spicy variant but even still   like i said there's really not too much else to  say about this one guys it's a juicy piece of   chicken kind of small with some tasty chipotle  sauce but even still i am definitely digging   the overall quality definitely fresh and nice  and fluffy and soft on that bread pretty good   all right and as for the spicy variant all it  is is adding an additional amount of heat thanks   to those jalapenos there but a little bit more of  that chipotle sauce it looks like i've got on this   one here but still all the same goodness on the  inside the spicing you can really kind of taste   as you get into this but even still guys like i  said it's a spiced up chicken tender on the inside   of a piece of a flatbread now we've got some  jalapeno action to go in on let's give it a shot the jalapeno does make it though that's pretty  good you know as i'm getting into this further   i can't help but be reminded of like the chick  star and the naked chicken chips they've done   in the past with that same tortilla coating on  the outside it's pretty much the same thing in   fact it's exactly the same thing but i'm liking  it pretty good well i gotta say this review feels   like it's turning into a quickie for me right now  because there's really not too much else to say   about it aside from just the stuff you've heard  already guys it really is pretty nice for what it   is and again even though it smacks of that value  menu goodness right there a little under three   bucks is a little bit of a stretch for this but  happy hour currently right now for the pre-release   not bad at a buck fifty a piece so still pretty  tasty and i would definitely rock this one again   especially if they rock this one as a continued  promo on happy hour that would really be the way   to go with this personally because like i said a  little under three bucks for that is a little bit   of a stretch so naturally at $1.50 a piece i don't  really feel so bad but hey hopefully they'll do   that so with that said i'm gonna have to give the  regular version of this all new crispy chicken   sandwich taco here at taco bell just an okay  7 out of 10 definitely a fun gimmick on this   for sure and it's kind of nice to see taco bell  trying to go with the industry and throw their   hat into the ring with a crispy chicken sandwich  so to speak but even still guys a value menu at   best but the quality is pretty decent it's thick  on that chicken it's juicy on that chicken and   the chipotle sauce that you know and love really  shines through with the softness of that flatbread   pretty tasty especially for a buck fifty and that's  what's really getting this one an extra point or   two right now because guys like i said a buck  fifty for that i think is perfect to be honest   as for the spicy variant that one's gonna get  just a decent 7.5 out of 10 because   honestly i liked a little bit of extra heat that  that one offered and naturally with the jalapeno   crunch the overall flavor really it added to it  overall just a nice combination of goodness right   there and again very familiar with a little bit  more heat but even still pretty good order ahead   and pick yours up at our contactless drive-through  all right i got
