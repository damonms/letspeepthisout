very wet very juicy as you guys can see by the paper here it is absolutely loaded with juicy goodness we have some cheddar cheese on the very bottom and there is plenty of caramelized onions on top let me actually open this up so you guys can see this little closer nicely done there caramelized onion goodness lots of that highly marinated meat that's in there guys looking really nice let's go

this sucker this definitely looks pretty incredible and I've got a lot of caramelized onions coming up on this first bite it's the double dip sandwich brand new here at Dickey's Barbecue Pit Oh oh my god marinated goodness mmm ma'am a very deep and rich brisket flavor with some highly flavorful caramelized onions guys I'm not really tasting the cheddar cheese yet because of the overflow of the meat and the caramelized onions but wow this is fantastic let's go for another bite because I really want to get further into this one right now mmm it's just so soft Wow super tender this is a pretty luscious experience already guys that Texas brisket is highly marinated it's very juicy very wet very flavorful super tender and the caramelized onions are complementing it very nicely some nice sweetness they're not too much crunch but just a very very nice overall smooth rich flavor across the board and like I said even though I can taste that cheddar cheese I do not care one bit it's really kind of holding it all together like cheese usually does for sandwiches of his type but man super flavorful on this one highly recommended already and that's all without getting into the au jus yet and guys let me just say one more time the caramelized onions I've got a whole bunch of them here underneath the sandwich actually highly flavorful super delicious mmm Wow finger looking good let's go for another bite mmm so satisfying the quality of the meat here at Dickey's is always top notch it's very juicy very flavorful I've had it many times in the past most notably as some of the food festivals that I've actually done here in my channel and I have to say even at those festivals the juiciness the flavor fulness of everything comes through so amazingly well but guys you know what I think it is time we go for what this one is being billed as meaning the double dip so let's go for the au jus real fast see if this one delivers I've got to be careful with this one it's very messy in the car but guys a very beefy aroma actually on the au jus right here let's give this a go this just can't be bad right it just can't mmm oh my god it's not oh man double-dip baby here we go mmm oh man this is heavenly as I'm stirring it around it's beefier and beefier in the aroma department this is really really good stuff and that hoagie bun is soaking it up it's like a sponge here we go guys we're going again I hope you're enjoying what you're seeing right now if you're watching this after 1AM like I always say I apologize here we go oh my god I'm gonna kill this but before I do let me just say this au jus definitely adds a little bit more saltiness to the overall sandwich it's very rich very flavorful but again the aftertaste that I'm getting is very salty so the initial deliciousness that I'm getting from the sandwich is absolutely there but there's a little bit more of a residual saltiness that I'm not really caring for too much but guys the juiciness is amazing the caramelized onions are amazing and overall the combo works extremely well it's highly worth it with this it's still pretty tasty I only wish the cheddar itself was just a little bit sharper to give me just a little bit more extra flavor but as it stands guys a very very tasty sandwich worthy of the price of admission the quality is definitely dripping off of this bun literally it really is very very lean and I have to admit the brisket is just amazing caramelized onions absolutely delicious and you can't go wrong with that combo and especially with the au jus adds a nice little bit of flavor extra just expect a little bit more saltiness to it though but delicious either way man very messy but highly worth the time guys those are the type of problems you want to have when you review food you want it to be nice and marinated you want it to be nice and juicy like that and this easily was and I have to admit that au jus complimented it so amazingly I'm so glad I checked this one out right now and hey how could I not considering this was a meaty blast of Texas brisket with some delicious caramelized onions on top with a little bit of cheddar cheese thrown into the mix even though I really couldn't taste that very much still very delicious either way so with that said I'm gonna have to give the double dip sandwich very worthy of the name by the way with that au jus here at Dickey's Barbecue Pit a rock-solid 9 out of 10 as you may have picked up on throughout this review the only real detractors for me on this one was the fact that cheddar cheese didn't have too much flavor to it it was pretty much the glue holding it together as is usually the case with these types of sandwiches and the au jus which was really tasty added just a little bit of extra salt that I would've preferred to be a little bit on the lesser side but other than very flavorful all around and guys very hearty you really can't go wrong with what this is it was pretty great now the question
