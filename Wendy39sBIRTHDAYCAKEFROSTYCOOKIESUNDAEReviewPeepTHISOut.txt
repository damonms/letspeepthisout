peep this out that's right Wendy's is turning the big 5-0 and to celebrate we've got the birthday cake frosty cookie Sundae a very nice-looking dessert here guys I got to say this is looking really really nice a simple build though if you look at it closely pretty much three main ingredients starting off with the frosty itself it's getting its first new flavor in about 50 years actually as well and that actually includes birthday cake flavoring mixed in with that vanilla topped off with that confetti goodness right there and sugar cookie crumble pieces on the top guys looking really really great let's not waste any more time on this one before it melts any further this is the all new birthday cake frosty cookie sundae celebrating 50 years of goodness from Wendy's let's peep out this flavor so for all of you peeps who wanted me to review the frosty over here at Wendy's considering I love staying frosting I love telling you guys to do the same how could I not do the 50th anniversary version of it right I mean considering what this is birthday cake goodness you know we're gonna get into this guys this is already melting pretty quick but real quick before we do that if

content drops every week here we go it's the birthday cake frosty cookie Sundae over here at Wendy's and guys I can get into this right now because it is beautifully cool outside a nice time to be having this as well making the confetti let's give it a shot mmm mmm bangin wow first off as I was putting that into my mouth the instant flavor of the birthday cake flavoring on top of the frosty was coming through and then you get the nice pieces of the sugar cookie crumbles and then a little bit of the crunch of the confetti but overall very refreshing and very tasty guys this is really really nice let me go for another scoop of this and I'll give you a close-up before this melts any further hang on mmm you know time is of the essence whenever you review ice cream in the car and this is definitely melting fast guys but as you can see a lovely situation it's definitely holding its own in a thickness Department the frosty is legendary for that alone and the flavor of the birthday cake along with those confetti pieces is awesome add in the mix of the sugar cookie crumbles and you definitely have a very tasty dessert pretty awesome stuff well hopefully that last shot stayed in focus for you but just in case of course I'm gonna overlay some footage so you can get a closer look at this one and see what it has to offer this is pretty much offering some deliciously tasty goodness by far but you know what I think it really kind of needs a little bit of chocolate sauce or something just a little bit extra I think their last cookie Sundae had like a chocolate drizzle like a ghirardelli chocolate drizzle something like that this can benefit from something like that as well but on top of the flavor that it's got I got to be honest guys even without it it's still super rich still super frosty-like and guys with the cookie on top the confetti and just the overall crunch and appearance lovely situation one more scoop of this one one more close up and we'll wrap this one up well here's to 50-plus more years of frosty goodness over here at Wendy's and with this flavor of birthday cake infused into the vanilla frosty itself this one better stick around because it's a delicious flavor overall and those sugar cookies really add a nice bit of chewiness on top of everything this one has to offer very very delicious and highly recommended so with that said I'm gonna have to give the birthday cake frosty cookie Sunday here at Wendy's celebrating 50 years of goodness a rock-solid 9 out of 10 and like you heard me say earlier the only reason it's not a 10 out of 10 is because I think this one can really benefit by a little bit of extra chocolate thrown into the mix I don't think that would deter from the flavor of the birthday cake in general but it would have been nice to have just a little bit more color in that one in addition to the confetti color don't get me wrong it's still good but hey it's your birthday splurge a little bit go all-out and maybe add like a little bit of marshmallows or something extra but guys on its own like I said very delicious give it a shot now of course the obvious question is are you gonna give it a shot drop some comments down below are you a fan of the frosty already over here at Wendy's and if you are how excited are you that I'm finally checking this out at least a version of it here at Wendy's tonight drop those
