 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty in a move that I think most peeps expected wendy's drops the chicken variant of their recent bacon jalapeno goodness and it looks to be bringing a little extra spice to the party yes sir you already know what it is it's the spicy bacon jalapeno chicken sandwich and just like the bacon jalapeno cheeseburger before it there is a ton of toppings bursting out of this thing here guys looking really really nice with that shiny brioche on top let's take a look underneath the hood plenty of pickled jalapenos we've got some of that smoky jalapeno sauce lots of crispy onions we've got applewood smoked bacon there's an American cheese slice in there and a cheese sauce on top of it and that's all on top of a homestyle chicken patty here guys fried up to a crispy golden-brown you guys can see right there and it also happens to be marinated in all the usual peppers and spices on top of it so we've got some extra spice to go with everything else here and underneath it there is nothing else there and I'm okay with that because it is all on top but guys plenty of the pickled jalapenos in there and I have a feeling this is going to deliver the heat the smell of those crispy onions is pretty glorious right now let's give this one a shot it's the spicy bacon jalapeno chicken sandwich here at Wendy's let's peep out this flavor yes sir some nicely fried crispiness is in the air right now and that actually pairs up very nicely with the homestyle look of the chicken patty itself guys this is really a nice-looking sandwich with all the toppings and everything that it's got and I'm definitely getting into this right now but right before I do and as always if you guys are fans of high quality delicious looking food reviews

chicken sandwich brand new here at Wendy's mmm oh there is the heat it oh it's a lot of it too oh man hold on one second wow it's not so much from the pickled jalapenos and I can barely talk right now as it is from that smoky jalapeno sauce and the breading from the chicken itself guys that is a real standout right now oh my god that is very hot it's a lovely situation though because the quality of the chicken is actually bomb here Wendi's I think most of you guys know that the smokiness of the bacon coming up on the back end I can barely talk right now that's how crazy it is but we're going in front of the bite because I got to give you a close-up I gotta rest for a second mmm eat the heat indeed this one is really delivering the heat Department very nicely guys it's mostly coming from the smokey jalapeno sauce and the breading from the chicken itself that combination is a beautiful thing and then when you mix in the saltiness of the applewood smoked bacon and the light flavor that I'm getting from the cheese it's really more of a heat that's masking everything you're getting a very nice situation here and that's in addition to the softness of the bun not bad you know with the current chicken sandwich craze happening right now in the fast food industry it's nice to know that when something has spicy in a title it can mean a lot of different things I mean of course spicy means just that spicy but how spicy you don't really know naturally when you're getting a sandwich with everything this one has got without jalapeno sauce with the sliced pickled jalapenos in general you already know it's gonna be kind of hot add in the fact that the marinated chicken patty on this is also heated guys this really is a one-two-three punch to really deliver that spice in spades it really is pretty awesome and then when you add in the other toppings with the applewood smoked bacon those crispy onions and the cheese sauce which is kind of non-existent I mean it's kind of there but not really guys everything really blends together the saltiness is there the heat is continuing to build on me right now as well and overall it's just a very tasty chicken sandwich I only wish the patty itself was a little bit thicker and maybe a little bit juicier but other than that guys this is a toppings showcase and it really does deliver yup just like the bacon jalapeno cheeseburger before it there is a lot going on with this one but the fact that the patty itself is definitely heated adds to the overall package in general I think if there was some heat in the actual burger patty the first time out with the cheeseburger I think that'd be pretty unique on its own but considering Wendy's is known for their spicy chicken it's nice to know that the combination of everything else here works extremely well and how could it not with everything that it's got in front of you here guys a toppings showcase for sure like I mentioned and something you should easily give a try it's pretty tasty even if the chicken itself was a little on the dry side but I guess that's what the sauces are for right so overall I'm gonna have to give the spicy bacon jalapeno chicken sandwich here Wendy's a pretty rock-solid 8.5 out of 10 and the only thing really knocking this one back and I've already mentioned it already to you is the fact that the chicken patty was a little on the small side it's a little thin and not quite as juicy as I would have liked but like I also mentioned this is a toppings showcase just like the bacon jalapeno cheeseburger so with the addition of that flavored patty which is a really delicious thing in general like I said you have a lot to look forward to with this one if you like all those toppings and I think most of you guys do they fit the burgers pretty well the chicken is no exception now of course the obvious question is are you gonna give this one a shot with the chicken drop those comments down below how excited are you to give this version of the bacon jalapeno a shot over here at Wendy's and if you've liked the cheeseburger are you even more excited to give it a try because it's chicken now drop those comments down below
