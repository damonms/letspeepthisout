parmesan absolutely  and there's eight pieces of gloriousness here   to really get into and i can't wait  to do just that freshly baked dough   and it looks really really nice on top of  the aroma but the main star of the show is   easily going to be what's under the lid of what  they're calling oven baked goodness guys take   a look at this here this is looking pretty  fantastic what we've got is a combination of   cheddar asiago parmesan american and pizza  cheeses all together in this oven baked tin   and i gotta say it is looking pretty awesome lots  of deliciousness here and it's very aromatic and   being that i had the choice to either pair this up  with parmesan or garlic twists i definitely wanted   to keep the cheesy theme going so guys let's not  waste any more time on this one we're gonna get   into this it's the five cheese dip and parmesan  bread twists here at domino's let's peep out   this flavor wow there's really no easy way to show  this to you guys here i'm gonna try and keep it in   focus but lots of cheesy action as it's beginning  to kind of fall towards the front there guys i   gotta say this is looking really nice and it is  burning hot i'm actually using the lid of the   tin itself to kind of hold this here and i'm not  going to take too much time either because this   is really beginning to get crazy right now in my  hands let's just give this a shot i'm going to get   some going here for you we've got lots of cheesy  action looking pretty fantastic i'm trying to keep   this focused guys it's burning hot look at those  five cheesy actions let's just give this a shot   it's the five cheese dip in bread twists aka the  parmesan bread twists here at domino's let's do it oh my god oh so much cheese so much oily  goodness on this and you're probably noticing   all the oils right now on this pan guys let me  try and keep this as focused as possible i'm   gonna try and lift some of this up this is crazy  decadent in the cheese department but man it is   burning hot at the same time very delicious it  goes very nicely with this pizza bread dough   you obviously know the bread twists they're  pretty banging over here let's keep going in oh man all day long with this one wow   but crazy oily at the same time on top of it  being extremely heated in my car right before a   thunderstorm believe it or not the weather is so  crazy right now so this is a lot of fun to film   i gotta say guys i'm glad i'm getting into some  nice gooey cheese action here really really   delicious stuff this just is super delicious i'm  hoping this is staying in focus because i'm trying   to keep my hand from losing feeling because of how  numb it's getting it's crazy hot let's keep going man really really delicious and just to show  you these parmesan twists these are all pretty   nicely sized guys they're nice little puffs  of deliciousness cloud-like and i gotta say   very dense but airy at the same time with  just the right amount of goodness dusted   with that olive oil goodness on the bottom i'm  guessing there as well on top of the parmesan   very very lovely situation on this all right so  let me try and let this drain down to the other   side closest to me as i bring this forward  and we're going to give this another try   it is crazy delicious in the  cheese department guys i mean   really really nice is a nice little add-on to  any pizza dish that you get here let me see if   i can try and grab it as much as possible there  it is right there let's give this piece a shot hmm it's man the parmesan and the asiago gets  you that is so freaking delicious and because i   want to try and give you as many money shots  as possible with this one here i got to tell   you guys this is a really nice dip to start  off with guys they're really really lovely   in the cheese department with this one the  nice choice of cheeses here everything blends   together beautifully just the right amount of  saltiness on everything as well but it's oily   that's the only thing but super delicious  at the same time let's go for another bite and as it begins to rain right now on me right now  perfect timing it is raining flavor at the same   time so guys i'm gonna go for one more on this  one we'll close it up with the rating coming up   next but a lovely situation of goodness right over  there one more time we'll give you another close   up here at the very end super delicious stuff  and an easy recommendation this is pretty awesome well if you're a cheese lover this should easily  be on your radar guys i mean the combination of   cheddar asiago parmesan american and pizza cheeses  together oven baked how bad could this really be   no matter what you dip this into it's only going  to enhance it that much further but i would easily   recommend going with the parmesan twists just to  pair it up and to keep that cheese train moving   along i'm telling you guys really delicious  stuff on this all right so with that said i'm   gonna have to give the all new five cheese dip  and bread twists aka the parmesan twists here at   domino's a pretty rock solid 9 out of 10 guys  the flavor was intense across the board don't   get me wrong this really is a 10 out of 10 the  only thing that takes a point off for me at least   is the fact that the oil factor is a little up  there you're going to notice it's going to kind   of pool on the very top and you probably  noticed that in some of the close-ups but   even still the flavor delivers across the  board and again how could you go wrong with   a very cheesy type of sauce because that's  what it kind of feels like with some fresh   baked bread especially of the parmesan variety  the combination like i said is super flavorful   and it should enhance just about any meal you  get over here any pizza whatever you want to   do still super delicious and that combination  of cheeses absolutely works but you may want   to dab it down with a napkin or three before you  get started but even still it's super delicious   all right so before i get washed away do me a  quick favor drop some comments down below what   did you think of this five cheese dip over here at  domino's they're brand new naturally on the menu   but what did you think of the presentation is it  enough in the tin for the price point i mean $8.99   is a little up there considering pizza prices  drop those comments down below and definitely   let me know and with that this is ian K closing  out another high quality foodie feature for you   here on peep this out
