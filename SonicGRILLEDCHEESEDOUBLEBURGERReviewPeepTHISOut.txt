 hey everyone welcome back to another high quality  foodie feature for you here on the channel where   this time i'm over at sonic america's drive-in  to check out a nice meaty little upgrade to   their popular grilled cheese sandwich that's right  it's their all new grilled cheese double burger   so stay tuned because it's up next welcome to  peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty so here we go with the grilled cheese double  burger here at sonic and initial first impressions   this is looking pretty fresh and it should  considering i had to wait just a little bit to   get this so it definitely looks absolutely made  to order and the toastiness of that texas toast   is looking pretty awesome all right so let's pop  the top and take a look underneath and it looks   like what we've got here is one of the two slices  of melted cheese stuck on the very top here along   with some mustard some ketchup some diced onions  and because i ordered the double we've got two   100% pure beef patties the junior variant here  so this looks like it's a little on the smaller   side but even still definitely meaty and the meat  does look pretty solid pretty fresh looking looks   like there's no cheese in the middle of this one  to kind of hold it together that second slice is   actually on the very bottom so as i try and peel  it apart for you here as you can see it's just two   slices of cheese top and bottom but even still all  the goodness in the middle of this one is looking   pretty tasty i have to admit so let's not waste  any more time on this one let's see if the flavor   delivers this is the all-new grilled cheese double  burger here at sonic let's peep out this flavor   yes sir i gotta say these are some fresh-looking  beef patties over here at sonic probably some of   the freshest that i've had in a very long time  it's absolutely looking pretty decent especially   with the toastiness of that texas toast this is  looking and feeling really nice and substantial   in my hand guys even though they're junior  patties i'm really digging the overall girth   and weight that this has got right now and real  quick first things first i got to tell you this   is kind of reminding me of the patty melt that  i did way back in the day and honestly minus a   few ingredients this really is the same burger  i think the only difference with this version   compared to the other is the patty melt i believe  had mayo instead of ketchup this one's got ketchup   and it was a quarter pound of beef but everything  else was the same the grilled onions the cheese   pretty much the same thing but even still i  don't remember having patties as fresh as that   that is just looking really really awesome so  yes we are finally getting into it right now   this is the all-new grilled cheese  double burger here at sonic let's do it mmm fresh and juicy wow i have missed you sonic  i have missed you right off the break this   is reminding me of a quarter pound of beef guys  and actually just taking a look at it after that   first bite it's got the thickness of a quarter  pound of beef as you can see there after cooking   it's looking pretty good but guys it's juicy it's  flavorful this is how it should be when i review   over here at sonic preferably this is the way to  go i really am digging this so far all the flavors   are singing another bite we'll give you a close-up  shot and we'll break it down even further hang on oh yeah well that mustard and ketchup  combo is definitely giving a nice zip   to the overall flavor with this one guys and  the creaminess of that cheese comes in on the   back end along with the crunch of the onions  but the first thing that's taking center stage   is obviously the double meat this is the way to  actually have this because you can really feel   the actual quality as you get into this here  and it's a heartier bite too on its own   as a single it's probably gonna be a little on  the thin side but even still guys like i said   very juicy especially if it's made to order  as this one appears to be very nice yeah this   almost feels like the unofficial sequel to the  patty melt review that i did a while back which   wasn't an overly bad burger from what i remember  back in the day but even still with this one   being as fresh as it is right now along with the  toppings and the grilled cheese aspect which i'm   not really kind of getting here it just feels like  more like a glorified cheeseburger naturally but   even still the double patties make the difference  and like i said with the crunch of the onions and   the zip that i'm getting from the ketchup and  the mustard it's a nice combination and a very   very nice presentation because the toastiness  you can actually feel it and as you bite into   it even though it's a little on the soft side  it still is very satisfying let's keep going in i guess the only real downside with this right now  from what i'm experiencing is the fact that the   texas toast is beginning to get super flat as i go  and i guess that's kind of the case with most fast   food type of promo burgers or anything in general  like that take a look at that it's almost becoming   like two sheets of a few pieces of paper actually  but even still the ends are pretty thick the crust   is nice and i'm digging the quality of that meat  like i said the combination of the mustard and the   ketchup and the onions is primo i'm not really  a super fan of ketchup personally believe it or   not on meat like this on burgers i mean mustard is  cool but this is actually working very very nicely   all right i think i've gotten just about  everything i pretty much can out of this   right now let's go for one more bite we'll close  this review up after the rating coming up but   guys a very very nice outing here over at sonic  thankfully because the meat is super fresh super   juicy this is how you want to experience it very  very tasty one more bite and we'll close it up hang on so yeah i'm so glad i did the double with  this because like i said that beef makes   the difference and as we go around the world  you're gonna see the cheese is not too bad i   would have liked maybe a third slice right in  the middle to keep it together and i'd probably   taste it a little bit more but as it stands  the combination of the ketchup and the mustard   is really kind of overpowering all the other  flavors then the beef comes up on the back end   with everything else but even still there's  plenty of beef here you can absolutely taste it   and it is super fresh and of course presentation  is key this is looking pretty awesome with the   toastiness of that texas toast nice stuff this  time sonic nice stuff sonic grilled cheeseburger   all right so this one is pretty easy for me right  now with everything you've seen and heard of my   review up to this point i'm gonna have to give the  all-new grilled cheese double burger here at sonic   a rock solid 9 out of 10 and the only reason it's  not the perfect 10 out of 10 is because i would   have liked to have tasted the cheese just a little  bit more a third slice right in the middle to   kind of keep everything from moving around would  be the way to go with that and it would really   kind of give you that feeling of a grilled cheese  actually because even as it stands the toastiness   of the bread is there and all the other flavors  were amazing and again with the freshness of   that beef right now that was a banging situation  probably some of the best quality beef i've had   over here at sonic in a very long time let's see  if we can have that trend continue sonic please   all right so i got to ask you real quick have you  ever had a really super fresh burger over at sonic   i mean literally when you feel like it's juicy  like freshly made like this one was drop some   comments down below let me know if you've ever had  an experience like that and if you've tried this   new grilled cheese double burger especially the  double variant of it what did you personally think   of it was it really banging for you drop some  comments down below and definitely let me know   and
