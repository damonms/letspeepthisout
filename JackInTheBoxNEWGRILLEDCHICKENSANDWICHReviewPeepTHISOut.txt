 what's going on everyone and welcome or welcome  back to the channel it's ian k where today i'm   headed into jack in the box to check out the  newest version of club cluck they have on their   menu now available for a limited time only and  hey it just happens to be grilled this time too   that's right you already know it's the very  simply named grilled chicken sandwich so   stay tuned because it's up next but first things  first let's set ourselves up through that drive-thru   welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty hi welcome to jack's what can i do for  you hey my friend how you doing today   i'm all right good good hey you know peep this  out i've got a mobile order pick up for ian k   for a grilled chicken sandwich please yeah  go ahead and pull forward great thank you all right well this should be a nice  little change of pace i mean i've done   all the versions of the clutch sandwich  up to this point so having one as grilled   that's definitely going to be pretty nice i think yeah how you doing great uh just a moment  for the grill chicken sounds good appreciate   it looks like this one's made to order  can't beat that so no worries brother   oh it's all good thank you man i appreciate  you all right stay frosty we'll see ya   all right guys let's peep this out well i don't  know guys this is supposed to be juicier tastier   and better than ever and honestly it looks smaller  than ever to be honest feast your eyes on the   grilled chicken sandwich over here at jack and as  you guys can see this is barely filling out the   sourdough bread here guys let's break this one on  down real fast before we get into it all right so   starting us off with some fairly sizable toasted  sourdough bread guys the presentation's looking   really nice nice and toasty let's pop in and take  a look underneath looks like we've got plenty of   their good good sauce some lettuce some tomato  as we pan down and that's all sitting on top of   what's supposed to be a juicier tastier better  than ever 100% all white meat chicken fillet that   actually has a slice of cheese on it i don't think  it's supposed to have that but i'll roll with it   on the bottom it looks like we've got more of  that good good sauce but guys coming back to   that chicken this is very very small i have to say  it's not really filling out the sourdough bread at   all but hey it is what it is i'm hoping the flavor  is going to deliver though so let's not waste any   more time on this one let's see if it does just  that this is the all-new grilled chicken sandwich   here at jack-in-the-box let's peep out this flavor  yup the sourdough bread is really taking up a bulk   of this sandwich guys and thankfully we've got  a chicken sandwich diaper in the very back but   i'm really hoping the flavor of this chicken is  gonna be superb because considering how thin it is   i don't really know about this guys it  is what it is let's just get into it   finally it's the grilled chicken sandwich new  over here at jack-in-the-box let's peep this out you know it's a little on the dry  side but thankfully we've got some   good good sauce to go in on let's  go for a few more bites on this one well it's not supposed to have cheese on it but  thankfully it's actually here guys because believe   it or not it's actually saving the sandwich  just a little bit the extra creaminess that   it's adding overall on top of the good good sauce  is really helping out this chicken fillet which   is a little on the small side as you can see  here but still guys so far the flavor is there   it's just not as sizable as i expected it to be  yeah it's definitely not as sizable as i would   have liked it to be especially close to seven  dollars here in southern cali thankfully the   flavor is really adding to this one the good  good sauce is a nice option to have over here   at jack it's unique to jack naturally but the  combination of that zippiness that i'm getting   from the sweetness the tang that i'm getting with  it as well is actually really good and believe it   or not it's actually helping the sandwich  along along with that cheese slice which   again is not supposed to be on here i'm really  thankful for that because it's adding even more   flavor it's kind of like a swiss cheese type  of situation but guys again i wish the chicken   really filled out the sourdough just a bit on  this as you can see it's a very small sandwich   for seven dollars let's go for another couple  on this one guys still tasty in terms of flavor yeah this one's going to be just  above average guys because like i said   the quality of the chicken is nowhere near  like it's supposed to be it's not really   juicy it's not really tastier it's just  okay but it's very very tiny and as you   can see here guys it's not filling out the  bread i keep coming back to it because guys   seven dollars you need to have a bigger sandwich  something overall to really kind of give you   the value there but i mean jack come on at least  look like a little bit of the picture that you're   advertising in the outside of the restaurant it  doesn't look anything like that whatsoever but   still guys like i said i'm really disappointed  by the size of this and i keep coming back to   it because it is a major thing that's really  sticking out outside of the flavor so let's go   for one more bite i think i'm pretty much done  with this right now we'll wrap the review up   with the rating coming up next but guys just a  little above average on this one but the flavor   of the good good sauce and believe it or not the  mistakenly slice of cheese that's been put on this   is really adding to the overall experience  one more bite and we'll close it out hang on well as you can see just with those four  bites or so that's pretty much all that's   left of the sandwich it is all bread and  lettuce after that guys so disappointing   on this one because of that but actually the  flavor is really delivering thankfully because   of that good good sauce it is what it is but  what can you do some days are just like that   order on ubereats postmates and grow up right so  getting right to it i'm gonna have to give this   new version of the grilled chicken sandwich  over here jack in the box just a   5.5 out of 10 guys like i said it's just above average and  honestly the flavor on that is actually not bad   the size of the chicken of course is killing that  and the fact that it's really not as juicy as i   would have liked granted it is white meat you  sometimes run the risk with that but when you're   advertising it as juicier tastier better than  ever guys it just needed to be bigger than ever   that would have added to the overall score because  there would have been a lot more to go in on and   naturally with the flavors of that good good sauce  really helping it out along with that cheese slice   which wasn't supposed to be there this would have  been a better experience but what i got today was   literally just a bread sandwich that was pretty  much it guys with a little bit of chicken on the   inside but hey like i said some days are like that  what are you gonna do alright so do me a quick   favor drop some comments down below let me know  if you're going to be giving this one a shot if   you've got jack in the box in the area and overall  what did you think of the presentation of this one   today do you think this was worth seven dollars  considering the flavor being halfway decent   drop those comments down below and definitely  let me know and with that this is Ian K   closing out another high quality foodie feature  for you here on peep this out reviews bringing   you brand new content every single week here on  my channel so while you stay tuned for that next review   coming real soon in the meantime stay frosty yes  sir i like it saucy too jack but i also like the   size of the sandwich to be a lot bigger as well  just saying all right everyone until next time   i'll talk to you soon hey thanks for checking  out another one of my reviews but just in   case you didn't see the one before this  one you can find it right up over here   along what i think youtube's going to recommend  for you to check out as well as always i think   you'll find something like in both of them and  i'll definitely catch
