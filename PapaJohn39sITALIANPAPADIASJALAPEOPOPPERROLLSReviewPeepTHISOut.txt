 hey everyone I'm back at it over at Papa John's yet again to check out round three of their papadias so get ready for the Italian because it's coming up next welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty it's handheld happiness part three here at Papa John's with their Italian papadia and already this is looking nice and toasty just like the other ones maybe a little bit more golden though this actually looks really really nice obviously we've got that folded over goodness cut down the middle let's take a look on the inside of this one and see what it's packing already that salami is jumping out guys this one has got alfredo sauce cheese Italian sausage and banana peppers in addition to the salami there and definitely decent guys a pretty simple build in this one but it looks really really good let's take a look on the other side real quick here and obviously more of that good stuff lots of salami definitely diggin the presentation there this is really looking and smelling great for dipping we've got some pizza sauce so I guess it fits the mode with the Italian motif here guys so very very cool with the toastiness on this one excited to give this one a go but as a bonus we're going in on something brand new on top of it guys the jalapeno popper rolls take a look at these we've got some pizza dough here along with Philly cream cheese and jalapeno and that presentation is killer you can really see those jalapenos coming through really really nicely there dipping sauce we've got some ranch to go with but I am really digging the size of these almost kind of like the pepperoni roll the way that they look but this one is popping more literally pun intended with the jalapeno good stuff there and obviously the Philly cheese goodness they're all that cream cheese goodness really looking to give this one a shot they look really really great guys I have to admit this is gonna be pretty good as a bonus for you as we go in on the Italian papadia guys let's see if the flavors gonna deliver on all this good stuff it's the Italian papadia and the jalapeno popper rolls here at Papa John's let's peep out this flavor yeah sit tight for those jalapeno popper rolls they'll be up in just a couple of minutes but first things first we got to jump into the Italian papadia and guys the smell of all the Italian goodness is easily permeating around the car here right now let's not waste any more time and give this one a shot but hey it just wouldn't be me if I didn't throw in a quick reminder so like always if you guys are fans of high-quality delicious

Papadia sign me up already with everything this one's got here we go Oh that is meaty hmm all right already this is winning in the flavor Department over the meatball pepperoni that I reviewed the last time out guys this one actually is a little bit saltier overall and you'd expect that because of the sausage the salami but the pickled banana peppers on top of it are elevating it even further my mouth is watering so much right now but it is very very tasty lemme go for one more bite of this then we'll give you a close-up again guy is very tasty a lot of flavor on this one and I'm glad I'm doing this one right now because I am so in the mood for it hang on mmm well I think most of you guys know by now if you watched any of my Papa John's reviews in the past I am absolutely a fan of the sausage over here so I'm glad that it's highlighted in this papadia it really adds a nice dimension and flavor on top of everything else I mean the salami is amazing as well and of course the cheese and again the pickled goodness from those banana peppers are off the chain not really tasting the alfredo sauce this is supposed to have but everything else is singing in the flavor Department guys it's Italian for a good reason and I love the name of it and you know now that I'm looking at this a little bit more closely I'm not really seeing too much of the alfredo sauce at all but that's okay because all of the Italian style meats that are in this right now make this one really what it is on top of the banana peppers I love that snap the crunch that they kind of give to it but again it's so pickled with everything that it really goes amazingly well with all the meat in here let's see how this is gonna pair up with the pizza sauce however you guys know I'm not really a super fan of pizza sauce as a dipping sauce option let's see what it does with it anyway let me try and get it just a little bit on the meat right over there too just to give it a little dimension in flavor and I think I got just enough for that taste there maybe a little bit more alright let's give this a shot this is probably gonna make it taste more like a traditional pizza because of the sauce but here we go mm-hmm right away definitely the light sweetness from that pizza sauce is clashing in the best most possible way with those banana peppers considering the snap and crunch and the acidity of those in general and the slight acidity of the pizza sauce itself that combination is really working nicely and then you get all the flavor of the other meats on the back end and of course the crunchiness of this actual dough itself guys the papadias are pretty b omb at Papa John's and I'm diggin it I don't really mind the pizza sauce too much with it this time out but I have to say the banana peppers are winning me over because that combination works so well really good hmm well what's really saving this one right now not that it really needs saving are those banana peppers it's really gonna help out in the score Department because on its own this is a very tasty papadia the Italian meats a showcased beautifully with this one but the addition of that pickled goodness from those banana peppers really take this one to new heights pair that up with the pizza sauce and that's a really lethal combination of flavor guys really tasty all right so without further ado let's jump into those jalapeno popper rolls to see what they're all about well already I'm liking what I'm seeing here right now guys this has got some really really nice puffy type of pizza dough that it's rolled into here and as you can see there is plenty of jalapenos all around plenty of cheese in here too as I'm kind of squeezing down on this right now this is a lovely situation I think this is one's gonna squirt it I'm gonna have to be careful so let me hold this box under my chin right now just in case it's the jalapeno popper rolls brand new here at Papa John's mmm no real squirt but lots of heat right away oh these are a whole pieces of jalapeno in here and that cream cheese is pretty nice as well Oh a lot of heat actually well there is no shortage of heat with this one guys I think I'm gonna have a little bit of trouble getting through this portion of the review because my mouth is watering so badly right now but in the best most possible way because the flavor is awesome as you can see whole chunks of jalapeno in there looks like the cheese is kind of blending in with the toastiness of that bread a little bit during the cooking process I think so it's there you can see it and the flavor is there but it's not really plentiful but as you can see the toastiness of that pizza dough is awesome and again plenty of jalapeno these definitely are awesome if you guys like a lot of heat I think I see why they put some ranch with this guys I think I'm gonna need it right now let's give that a shot too yeah that is no joke and I do not have any water with me right now I am sizzling in the back of my mouth so this is ultra difficult to do but I'm having so much fun doing it on camera right now in front of you guys let's go for that dip in the ranch and see exactly what its gonna do I need some cooling I need some refreshment right now I got a cool my taste buds off yeah this ranch can't come fast enough guys nice and creamy nice and rich nice and thick and I think it's gonna do the job nicely here let's go for a bite man that heat just keeps going with these let's knock it out hmm there it is I needed that mm-hmm hold on first off more that jalapeno is trying to bite back at me right now but the actual flavor of that ranch along with the cream cheese on the inside that is off the chart nice coolness it's fighting back and forth but again there is so much jalapenos on the inside of this guy's if you like heat this is seriously up there at least a seven and a half to eight based upon my scale and I like spice I'm getting better at eating it naturally but wow this is seriously awesome hang on one second I gotta cool my buds off one more time let's go for another quick dip as you just saw me do it anyway here we go mmm man that's primo it really is so yeah you spice heads are gonna dig these for sure there's no shortage of those jalapenos like I was saying guys and I really like the fact that the dough itself is very hearty when you bite into this it's really really a nice flavor overall that Philly cream cheese is definitely there flavor-wise it just doesn't pop as much as I thought it would but it really is very very well done in terms of the flavor and again the ranch goes amazingly well with it and just a nice job on these so let's just get right to the ratings because honestly I don't know how much longer my voice is gonna last those jalapenos are doing a number on me right now you don't want to know I wish I had some water I really need it for the Italian papadia here at Papa John's that's gonna get a rock-solid 9 out of 10 amazing flavor on that one those banana peppers are the wild-card easy with that it takes the flavor up above everything else the Italian flavor is really amazing with it the meats are really fresh and obviously when you pair that up with the pizza sauce just a lovely situation really worth it on that one and easily my second favorite and if you're wondering what the first is currently right now out of the ones that I've done take a look at that playlist popping up on your screen here right now I've done three of them so far and you guys obviously have a fourth to look forward to so watch for that very very soon but when it comes to the jalapeno popper rolls guys those are definitely awesome I got to say I love them the price point is good the flavor is good really just amazing overall in the heat department as you know so when it comes to the overall score for those I'm gonna have to give the jalapeno popper rolls brand new here at Papa John's a pretty rock-solid 8.5 out of 10 I only wish they popped just a little bit more in the cheese department but guys the flavor is awesome the heat is definitely there as you've seen already and easily with that ranch a nice pairing just a very very tasty side item to whatever else you get over here whether it's one of the papadias or the regular pizza now the question is do you plan on giving anything you've seen in this review a shot
