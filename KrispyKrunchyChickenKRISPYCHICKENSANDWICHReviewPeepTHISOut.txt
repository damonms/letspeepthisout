 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty alright everyone let's get it it's Ian K back  again with another high quality foodie feature   for you here on peep this out reviews this time  at a local convenience store that just happens   to be rocking krispy krunchy chicken and with  the chicken sandwich war still in full swing   you know i had to see what they had to offer right  so let's go in on their chicken sandwich and i   gotta say already the initial first impressions  very very tall this is looking pretty hefty guys i   gotta admit i'm really liking what i'm seeing here  let's pop the top of the semi-toasted bun take a   look underneath looks like we've got a nice wash  of honey butter on the very top here you can see   it's pretty plentiful but guys take a look at the  chicken itself plump chicken tenders we got two of   them here hand breaded and deep fried to a crispy  golden brown and i gotta say the thickness is on   point looking pretty nice underneath that it looks  like we've got three pickles and a little bit more   of that honey wash but guys this is looking really  really good and i gotta admit it's got some size   to it so let's not waste any more time on this  one let's check out the flavor on it of course   it's their chicken sandwich here at krispy  krunchy chicken let's peep out this flavor   alright real quick let me just start this off  by saying i'm not really a super fan of chicken   tender sandwiches which is essentially what  this is but guys the thickness of the chicken   looks pretty inviting and again it has definitely  got some thickness to it guys i really love the   breading on this it's looking pretty amazing  and those pickles on the bottom absolutely i'm   a huge pickle fan so this is already boating  well for that but guys let me just say very   thick and it's filling out this bun very very  nicely so can't wait to get into this one right   now it is very hot in my hands but before i do  and like always if you guys are fans of high   quality delicious looking food reviews make  sure to hit that subscribe button down below   and don't forget to tap that bell icon so you can  be notified as soon as brand new content drops   every week guys here we go the chicken sandwich  at krispy krunchy chicken i'm excited let's do it oh juicy oh whoa crazy flavor on this right off  the break that honey butter is standing out way   above and beyond that original chicken sandwich  that i tried over at church's guys and i gotta   say although that was really tasty it's a lot  more prevalent on this version of it and man   the thickness of that white meat  the juiciness of it on top of it   this is ridiculous i actually kind of feel it  dripping down my hands here right now i had to   pull back real quick because it's about to go  all over myself here but guys very delicious   so far let's go for another bite i'm digging this  the pickles are awesome on it let's keep going in man i'm really digging the light spicing that i'm  getting from that breading guys it's really fried   beautifully and i have to admit the overall  flavor is just lighting this one up big time   the nice catcher's mitt-style glove that  this has got is encasing everything together   and the juiciness of that chicken is just  on point but again i can't stop saying it   that honey butter wash it's got a nice  buttery flavor but vibrant honey on top   of it i am really digging that and i got  to admit guys just super delicious so far   let's keep going in because you know  obviously i really want to let's do it man that is seriously juicy wow i am really blown  away by this right now if this chicken sandwich   is as good as it is with chicken tenders can you  just imagine a regular chicken breast they need   to do that because honestly the writing is all  on the wall with this one guys they really need   to have a full chicken breast with this instead  of the tenders and that's saying nothing against   the quality of the chicken that i'm having  here right now believe me it's delicious but   like i said having just a regular like a huge  chicken breast would go so much further along   i think just overall having two chicken  tenders you kind of have to balance   not having one of them fall out naturally but  the overall quality of the chicken is amazing   and if you guys need any further proof of that  take a look at the playlist popping up on your   screen here right now i've reviewed krispy krunchy chicken in the past a couple of times and i've   been so over the moon with it and i gotta say i  was very excited to finally give a local version   the shot without traveling too far to get  to them to give that sandwich a shot and i'm so   glad that i did because it's great and hey if you  want to confirm that goodness for yourself take a   look at the link down below in the description for  krispy krunchy chicken's website or just yelp them   chances are you're going to have probably one or  two or three or four in the area because they have   a very unique delivery system naturally being in  convenience stores gas stations but guys don't   let that deter you the quality of the chicken is  insane and believe it or not they actually have   more locations than some of the bigger chains  out there so let's go for one more bite we'll   finish this one up after the rating but i am  so glad to have finally given this one a shot   and i'm easily going to be getting it again  it's a pretty banging sandwich let's do it alright let's go 360 on this one here guys and  like i've said in the past with some of the other   reviews i've done for the other chicken sandwiches  out there it's great to have choice and i got to   admit having this particular choice is something  you're going to want to try because it is really   off the chain and if you've never had krispy  krunchy chicken before you need to super juicy   on this the flavor of the breading is awesome  the light spicing it's not too salty and the   pickles are also a nice touch with this as you'd  expect it to be but again being encased in this   catcher's glove-like bun is really just a lovely  situation so just overall a very delicious chicken   sandwich you know nothing against the church's  chicken sandwich that came out recently which   was pretty amazing take a look at that review in  the upper right hand corner of your display if you   haven't seen that one just yet that one had honey  butter as well but i have to admit the krispy   krunchy chicken version of that is so much more  vibrant it's a little bit more in your face and   the butteriness is absolutely there and although  i really like that church's one like i said   this one takes it up a notch big time and with the  quality of the chicken tenders on that believe me   i really wish it was just a full on chicken breast  that would have been just the better way to go   what you're getting is a very girthy chicken  sandwich and let me just say it satisfies when   you bite into it super juicy and like i said the  breading is awesome just a very delicious chicken   tender sandwich and absolutely one i'd recommend  you try so with that said i'm gonna have to give   the chicken sandwich here a krispy krunchy chicken  a rock solid 9.5 out of 10 guys it virtually is a   10 out of 10 i just wish like i said earlier the  meat was just a full-on block of chicken breast   it would have been just amazing to do and why they  don't do that especially in this environment right   now they need to be doing that because everybody  is but let me just say what they've got here is   a top-notch product it was made extremely well  super hot super juicy the pickles everything about   that was just delicious and i can't stop talking  about it because it's so freaking delicious i'm   definitely going to be getting that again and guys  $3.99 come on how could you not alright so i've   got one simple question for you
