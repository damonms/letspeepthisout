 what's going on everyone and welcome back to  another high quality foodie feature for you here   on the channel cheaters cam style after hours  over jollibee this time to go in on their regular   fried chicken for the first time ever that's right  you already know what it is so stay tuned because   the two-piece chickenjoy is up next welcome  to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty so here we go with a two-piece chickenjoy  at jollibee my first time ever   giving this one a go guys and i gotta say the  presentation looks pretty awesome this chicken   looks fantastic starting off in the very  top take a look at that chicken thigh   lots of crispy coated goodness and i gotta  say the aroma in my car is definitely fried   as it should be because guys look at that the leg  is just as plump and let me just pick this up and   show it to you here a nice amount of plump juicy  action with this one guys and i like how that   skin is hanging off the back right there this is  looking pretty awesome very meaty and very hefty   off to the side we have a side of their adobo  rice which is kind of like a dirty rice and if you   look kind of close there it looks like there's a  little bit of pork in there maybe a little chicken   definitely some seasoning really really nice  presentation and a solid amount of it as well and   for dipping guys we're going in on some of their  gravy action it kind of smells like a chicken   gravy so i guess it fits the theme of what we've  got here guys but again a very sizable amount of   it as well and it looks like this little container  is perfect for dipping with that leg i can't wait   to get into that but all in all like i said the  presentation looks pretty awesome lots of fried   crispy goodness here guys and i can't wait to get  into it my first time ever going in on the chickenjoy   the two-piece set over here at jollibee let's  peep out this flavor well i gotta say it's pretty   difficult to film a meal like this in the car but  i'm definitely digging the opportunity to give it   a go and as you guys can see here i have a lot of  good stuff to get into the fried crispy goodness   of this chicken looks pretty amazing over here  at jollibee and i can see why so many of you guys   really are super excited about this i'm just  glad that i finally have one local which is   awesome i can't wait to try again more of the good  stuff they have on their menu but guys let's just   bring up this leg here real quick here take a  look at this action crispy goodness it really   smells awesome just a lot of fried fried aroma  in my car right now and i'm really digging that   there nothing really kind of distinct that stands  out different from regular fried chicken but i'm   definitely digging how this looks so how this is  gonna work let's go for a bite each on both of   these naturally and then a bite with the gravy  but guys i'm starting off with the leg because   i've got it up here right now let's give it a go  it's the chickenjoy here at jollibee let's do it mmm mmm juicy whoa right off the break aside from the juiciness  it's not overly greasy and not overly salty as   well i am really digging that guys it really  stands out it's very different from the other   guys like popeyes kfc church's it really is  definitely a lot less in terms of the sodium i'm   thinking and you can really taste the meat pretty  beautifully here guys this is looking really nice   fried crispy outer coating goodness and again very  distinct for jollibee because like i said it is   not salty and it's not really tripping me up so  much because of that i'm really digging the fact   that this is not salty at all all right i take  that back it's noticeably less than the other guys   even though it has a little bit of salt i mean  naturally it's fried chicken of course but guys   let me see what the big deal is with this gravy  action right here so we've got a nice container   of it there i'll try and show it as much as i  can without spilling and let's go for a dunk   little badunkadunk action i'm just gonna coat it  up very nicely for you look at that right there   trademark jollibee goodness my first time giving  it a go let's see what the hype's all about oh whoa man the hearts are falling all around  me right now for this guys a little salty on the   gravy but it is like a chicken-based gravy at  the same time but man the flavor is beautiful   with this it's smooth it's rich it's very chicken  brothy like and thick let's keep going in again   i'm breaking my rule here we're doing a  third bite with this this is pretty banging oh man all day long all day long  with this this gravy is crazy good   all right being that we have a little bit  here at the end let's just keep going for it   i'll try and keep the focus as much as i  can for you but guys a lovely situation   this is just crazy and again super fun to have  at night as well like it usually is here we go my god oh yeah oh yeah man that is a crazy  situation delicious going with the legs and   it's perfect to go with this gravy naturally  here guys really the perfect amount for it   really really good all right before we jump into  that thigh because i can't wait to give that a go   let's try some of this adobo rice here so  again it's kind of like a dirty rice so   basically you're going to get little pieces  of chicken pork a little bit of seasoning   it's not your traditional white rice and  it definitely has some more stuff in it   let's see what this is all about and again the  size is pretty good guys this is actually a   very nice portion size i'm pretty surprised  for one side this is almost like a large   elsewhere which is kind of nice so let's give  this a go here real quick and see how this is yeah it's a dirty rice dirty in  a good way let me just tell you   really really good stuff on this one little hints  of chicken that i'm kind of getting with this here   maybe some pork but it's more of the seasoning but  really really good and obviously this is going to   go good with the gravy i may have to kind of mix  that in just a little bit just to give that a go   mmm oh yeah really good actually i'm gonna put  a little bit in the gravy really quick here   i think that's gonna be a nice  little combination right over there   it's a little bit of that gravy action let's try  it and see how it is oh yeah adobo rice with that   gravy a beautiful thing guys a beautiful thing  i am so enjoying this experience right now and   i'm doing it for the first time on camera with you  guys this is really cool okay now enough of that   let's get into the chicken one more time here  and we'll see how much of this we can kill   i don't know how i'm going to dip this one this is  a big thigh it is super crispy look at that crazy   action on this and this is the original recipe  so i wanted to try and keep it light that way   you know the spicy i'm sure is going to be pretty  good as well but i wanted to kind of see how this   was going to go let me see if i can kind of bend  it slightly i want to get some of the sauce with   it but i wanted to see the flavor of the chicken  itself before it's masked with any spicy goodness   there but take a look at that try and keep that as  focused as possible here let's just go for a bite   have some fun with this right now here we go  mmm oh my god this is so freaking delicious crispy juicy not salty at all again and a thicker  piece of meat i know i'm gonna be coming back to   get this again and i'm gonna ask for two thighs  actually because i really love thighs in general   but guys look at the meat on that look at  glistening super fresh and this sauce the   gravy action with it is off the chart that is just  off the chart goodness right there guys hopefully   that's staying in focus as much as possible but  i'm gonna go for a huge bite with this one let's   give this a shot this is so fantastic right now  and it's crazy delicious at night let's do it oh man this is total heaven right now so  delicious and because i'm staring at it   and it's staring back at me let's go for  one more on this one guys one more time   plenty of that action take a look at that  we've got that gravy action right there   beautiful mixes nice with the juiciness of  the chicken itself and overall like i said   the non-saltiness that i'm getting or the  non-elevated saltiness is totally making   this an extremely pleasurable experience right  now crispy juicy very vibrant in flavor and the   fried goodness is standing out beautifully on this  one here i'm gonna go for one more bite and then   we'll give you one more quick shot of the chicken  because guys i really want to do it let's do it oh my god oh my god well i got to say if you've  got jollibee in your area run do not walk to give   this a go this was totally worth the wait i  am so glad to have finally given this one a   shot it is absolutely satisfying my expectations  beautiful amount of goodness with each of these   pieces of chicken right now super fresh very  vibrant in flavor and overall it goes amazing   with that gravy it really is an awesome dipping  situation with this the juiciness the crispiness   and the overall flavor is just banging  beautiful stuff guys beautiful stuff indeed   well i totally feel like i'm having dinner  with you guys right now so if you're having   something to eat while you're watching this  video right now this is actually a good time   for us to get down with some really really good  food together right i mean that is amazing i am   so glad to have given this one a shot and like i  said i'm so glad that jollibee is open in my area   again i can't wait to try some of the other  things on the menu but that is a high water   benchmark and easily one of the signatures  on their menu and i got to say that flavor   definitely delivered in spades along with the  dipping gravy that was just a beautiful situation   and deliciousness all around without a doubt so  with that said i'm gonna have to just score this   one obviously based upon my experience right now  guys i'm gonna have to give the two-piece chickenjoy   with this one side over here at jolli a very  sizable side of that an awesome   10 out of 10 super crispy super fresh super juicy and the  flavor absolutely delivered for $6.49 without a   drink or $7.99 with a drink you definitely have  a lot to look forward to in terms of just the   overall size and it satisfies just with two pieces  i'm pretty good right now i got to be honest guys   even with a little bit of that thigh left but just  the beautiful situation of everything in general   and like i said the size of that one side that you  get is awesome i mean there's a sizeable amount   of rice in there a beautiful situation all around  and like i said if you've got jollibee in the area   you know what you need to be doing if you haven't  already all right so i've got one simple question   for all you jollibee peeps out there out of the  two versions available the original that i had as   well as the spicy which is your favorite and why  which do you think
