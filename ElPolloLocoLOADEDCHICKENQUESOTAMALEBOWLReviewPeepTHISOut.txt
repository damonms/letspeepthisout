 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty hey everyone welcome back to another high quality foodie feature here on the channel cheaters cam style after hours at el pollo loco because holiday tamale bowls are now back on the menu and since el pollo loco wants us to unwrap a new tradition were definitely gonna do that by going in on one of them so let's do just that feast your eyes on their loaded chicken queso tamale bowl a definite mouthful of a title but then again we've got a mouthful of goodness guys this is a large portion in front of us here right now starting off on the left side there's the obvious the chicken tamale we've got it topped with a very decent amount of queso blanco very nice there swinging around the side we've got a nice portion of fire grilled chicken looks like a pretty decent amount of white meat as we go further around we've got a nice portion of pico de gallo of course some of  their hand-made guacamole definitely looking pretty nice for color it's all sitting on top of a bed of rice and beans so guys pretty substantial and for $6.99 this is not a bad deal so let's not waste anymore time on this one let's get into it it's the loaded chicken queso tamale bowl here at el pollo loco let's peep out this flavor yeah man I'm not gonna front right now there's some serious  heftiness going on in my left hand right now guys this is looking pretty nice and again lemme show that to you up close take a look at that it is absolutely filled to the rim with the good stuff there the thickness on this is pretty crazy pretty deep in this dish and I gotta say presentation wise this is looking pretty good that queso blanco is looking pretty amazing here so guys I'm not gonna waste any time with this here I'm just gonna cut right on into it this is looking nice thick masa on this tamale guys I'm actually actually having a lot of trouble cutting this right now I'm gonna go for a nice chunk here lemme bring this up this is a chicken tamale so no shredded pork on this one but as you can see not bad even at the end here as it's flopping over but that queso blanco is looking pretty lovely right there guys pretty nice let's give this a shot the chicken tamales here at el pollo loco they specialize in chicken so this can't be bad right let's hope not let's do it mmm it's not bad ooooh actually I may have spoke a little too soon because it's a little on the salty side I mean not  a little I'm really getting a lot of elevated salt but the creaminess of the cheese is absolutely awesome and guys the queso is a lovely situation here lemme pick up some this and we'll go with a little bit of the beans actions right over there just to kind of see what that enhances there I wanna see if that saltiness is coming from the tamale or if it's the cheese lemme give it a shot it's the cheese yeah way more salt in the queso it's flavorful don't get me wrong because salt equals flavor but the creaminess of the cheese is a little drowned out because of that but man the saltiness is really strong again the nice tamale goodness right over here that masa on the outside lovely situation let's keep going in it's not bad mmmm that's really tasty and admittedly el pollo loco is the reviews I've done in the past showcase a lot of that as it should because guys el pollo loco of course specializes in chicken A.K.A. the crazy chicken here el pollo loco that's what it is so lemme get into a little of this chicken action over here I've got it dipped into a little bit of the guacamole the fire grilled goodness right there definitely a lovely situation let's give this a shot mmm you can tell that was made fresh that's not from a canister it's got that whipped feel a little light chunkiness to it very nice and let's go for a little bit of the cheese and the rice here I'm having a little bit of fun with this we'll go for a little bit of everything on this one minus the tamale because I'm not gonna be able to fit all of that on the fork with but guys again look at this bowl its is loaded with the good stuff here so you have all the side right there as well as some chicken in there as well the beans the rice the queso blanco lovely situation minus the pico you know how I feel about that let's keep going in mmm yeah lovely situation alright lemme go for another piece of the tamale here I'm gonna give you a cross section shot actually here mmm the denseness of everything I just took in the last bite right now very super flavorful on this very super flavorful alright lemme swing this around and there's a nice cross section on this inside I'll try and fit it and not block it with the lighting but as you can see it's like a pureed type of chicken with seasonings and spices here guys very lovely situation there and again the thickness of masa on the ouside nice compliment it's almost like an even mix not too bad I probably wanna say maybe 60% meat and 40% coating on the outside of the tamale itself but you can really tasty the quality of it and that's really the cool thing let's keep going in mmm yeah it's better without the queso so much of it anyway up front 'cuz the saltiness is high on it for some reason but I like it it's just elevated that's the only thing so couple of more bites here but guys I am enjoying this bowl really really good some rice and beans little bit of everything there trying to give you as many closeups of the quality of this has I can and as you can see no shortage of the goodness on the inside here this is really done pretty well mmm yeah and again I can't get over the heftiness of everything on the inside of this it really feels substantial in my hand here right now and there's a really decent amount and you know what I'm really kind of glad there's only one tamale with this with all the extra chicken they do have versions of this on the menu that you're probably seeing on your screen here right now there's different variations  and combinations I should say of it but naturally a little bit of everything on this loaded queso bowl is the way to go because not only do you get the chicken tamale you get some of their chopped chicken on the side which they're known for they put that on pretty much everything here in fact just about everything here it's el pollo loco but of course the fresh guac you have the pico the beans the rice just a nice combination so lemme give another shot of this up close I'm gonna lift up the tamale and give it a shot lemme try and lift it sideways there you go there but as you can see quality made and I do have to say compared to what I reviewed recently from del taco this actually is  filled out a lot more from end to end with the chicken goodness naturally there it's not shredded pork but I really dig the quality of what this is and like I said guys what you're getting here in the bowl is pretty substantial for $6.99 and that lovely situation for tamales a holiday tradition just about everywhere that I know of anyway a lot of restaurants come out with this this is a  beautiful situation and an easy recommendation to try they do it pretty well over here at el pollo loco yeah definitely a pretty substantial amount of food on the inside of that bowl and personally for me I don't think I'd call it a bowl that's like a  full on platter of goodness guys there's no shortage of the bean and the rice that goodness is gonna fill you up but the thickness of the tamale is on point and the quality of it is solid that pureed chicken on the inside with the spicing is very well done there's a decent amount of meat as well and naturally the chopped chicken off to the side as well as that and when you add the pico and especially the guac for color I gotta admit it really stands out beautifully on that it's just a nice combination the only deterrent believe it or not is the queso itself because it is elevated in salt as least the version that I'm having right now really stands out and that's what kind of kills it slightly but thankfully the flavor of everything else does hold its own once you get past that so an easy recommendation to give this one a shot strictly because of the tamales alone they are worth your time but like I said the queso you wanna ask to have the put on the side to kind of see what you think of it so if it is a little elevated in salt you can kind of add a little bit at  time if you really wanna do that but guys still very tasty for what this is and I'm glad to have given this one a shot right now so overall I'm gonna have to the loaded chicken queso bowl a super mouthful of a title a pretty decent 7.8 out of 10 like I said it loses a couple of points because of the saltiness of the queso blanco itself but everything else absolutely shines in quality and like  I said everything you're gonna get in that is pretty substantial the bowl itself is a platter I really wouldn't call that a bowl it seriously is a really really is a solid amount of food so easy recommendation like I said give this on a go if you've got el pollo loco in the area alright so now the obvious question because you know it's coming right if you've got an el pollo loco in the area are you gonna be giving this one a shot drop some comments down below lemme know if you're gonna give this one a go and actually how important are tamales to you during the holiday season there is
