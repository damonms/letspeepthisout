 hey everyone welcome or welcome  back to the channel it's Ian K   over at pizza hut this time to check out  another version of their all new spicy   lovers pizza and i got to be honest with you  guys this one could be a little controversial   for some of you peeps out there so stay  tuned because the hawaiian chicken spicy   lovers pizza is up next welcome to peep  this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty all right so i know you're ready so let's peep  this out guys feast your eyes on their all new   spicy hawaiian chicken pizza here at pizza  hut definitely a lovely situation in the   presentation department this is one of the  new variants in their all-new spicy lovers   pizza line that's currently available for a  limited time only and regardless of how you   may be feeling about pineapple on pizza you can't  deny this is actually a very tasty looking pie   alright so what you're looking at here is a large  eight slice pizza initially topped off with spicy   marinara sauce that actually has a little extra  garlic in it for that added kick and on top of   that the stars of the show we've got grilled  chicken and pineapple cut up all throughout   here and i gotta say that yellow is definitely  adding to the overall color differentiation to   go with those raging red jalapenos those is going  to add just a little bit more sweetness on top   of the pineapple and the presentation looks  awesome with all the seeds in them finishing   this off we've got fiery flakes it's basically a  custom blend of herbs and crushed chili peppers   and i gotta say guys it looks really really nice  definitely colorful and i'm digging that contrast   again between the pineapple and those jalapenos  yes sir very nice on this one the presentation is   awesome guys and again like i said regardless  of how you feel about pineapple on pizza the   color is looking pretty nice in this and again the  sweetness to go with those red jalapenos and the   pineapple i'm thinking this is going to be pretty  good so always a challenge like i say to do pizza   in the car let me pick up one of these slices  and we'll go for it this is looking very nice   a little bit threatening looking on this one  actually here decent amount of that goodness that   you can see that there's a lot of fiery flakes  all throughout this one and the toastiness on   the bottom not too bad but again coming back to  it pineapple and chicken the red jalapenos and   of course the spicy flakes of that custom blend  let's give this a shot guys it's the all-new spicy   hawaiian chicken part of the new spicy lovers  pizza line over here at pizza hut let's do it yes yup without even getting into the red  jalapenos just yet those fiery flakes are   lighting this one up beautifully right now  guys the steaminess is definitely there   and when you combine that with the sweetness of  the pineapple this is actually going very nice   a little bit of the chicken action that i got  there as well but it's mostly a fire flake show   with a little bit of the pineapple that i  got in that first bite but guys very nice   of course that cheese blend looking pretty  good but coming back to those peppers look   how beautiful they are guys pretty nice quality on  this one let's keep going in guys pretty tasty so   far and i had a feeling it would be considering  the ingredients list on this let's keep going in those red peppers are banging on this yeah so  good in fact that i actually have to steal one   of these peppers off of another slice because i  really want you to see this guys really really   nice in terms of the presentation here just look  at that there's a decent amount of those seeds on   the inside and i have to say that is adding a  nice little layer of goodness on top of those   fiery flakes that's really where a lot of the heat  is coming from the spicy marinara is definitely   there in the background but it's mostly the fire  flakes and these jalapenos that are lighting it up   with the extra sweetness that i'm getting from the  pineapple and a little bit of the protein from the   chicken but guys a very solid ingredients  list for this particular pizza for sure   yeah this is absolutely more flavorful than the  double pepperoni that i just reviewed which is   probably popping up here on your screen at the  moment here but i gotta say guys if you're a   pepperoni lover obviously you're gonna dig that  one for sure but with this you're getting some   nice variation of sweetness on top of the heat  and it's not just necessarily heat for the sake   of having heat you can taste everything the flavor  profile is really shining through with the nice   residual burn that i'm getting kind of in my mouth  right now but very tasty on this one guys let's   go in for a couple more really good mmm yup yup  yup yup i've definitely gotten a lot better when   it comes to spicy foods reviewing here on the  channel naturally but i have to say with this   this is still pretty much up there in terms of  the overabundance of heat compared to what you may   be used to from kind of like a fast food type of  pizza situation it's noticeably elevated and i'd   probably say still about a six or seven overall  that residual burn is still doing its thing   but i have to say guys again the flavor profile is  really standing out above the heat that's what i   really like about this you can taste everything on  top of that nice comforting burn it's pretty good   and honestly i'd venture to guess that  custom blend of these fire flakes would   go good on just about any type of food that you  sprinkle it on guys but when it comes to this   of course with pizza it's really lighting up  nicely there's nice little flavor that i'm   getting from the cheese there and again you can  see those seeds beautifully on that pepper action   it is really nice but plenty of pineapple which  i don't mind i know it's controversial because   of what it is but i think this works very very  nicely okay so before we round this one out with   the rating coming up very shortly here do me a  favor and drop some comments down below let me   know how you feel about pineapple on pizza i mean  does it deserve to be there should it be there do   you like it on pizza and what do you think of this  particular entry so far in the spicy lovers line   but guys again very lovely situation on this  and i am so glad to have given this one a shot   pineapple or not i love the spicy blend that's on  here it's really good let's go for another bite well i gotta say i'm definitely digging the flavor  profiles of these new spicy lovers pizzas over   here at pizza hut you can really taste everything  nicely and it goes amazing with the amount of heat   that's on here it's not scary heat but it's enough  to really kind of let you know that yes it's   elevated but very pleasurable overall with the  flavor profile and again with the combination of   pineapple as well as the chicken on this one which  i wish it was just a little bit more of you're   getting a very nice flavorful pizza and it's  definitely different guys definitely different   indeed so with that said i'm going to have to give  this colorful hawaiian chicken variant of the all   new spicy lovers pizza here at pizza hut a pretty  solid 8.3 out of 10 guys it's just above 8   because it really delivers an overall presentation  as well as flavor and while i didn't actually need   water this time out because i think i'm kind of  getting used to the flavor that it's got already   especially after the double pepperoni what you're  getting still is a lot of elevated heat that works   very well with the flavors and the ingredients  list very high quality for what it is guys not bad   in terms of the price point at $12.99 and at the  same time you're getting something truly different   when it comes to qsr pizza i gotta say this works  very very nicely guys very very nicely indeed   all right if you've already dropped a comment  down below letting me know what you think of   pineapple on pizza see if you can maybe add to  that comment by dropping an additional one down   below and let me know what you actually thought of  this particular variant out of the three that are   currently out there of course the veggie's coming  up very soon as well but i'm curious to know
