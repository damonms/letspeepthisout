 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty what's going on everyone it's Ian K back again  with another high quality foodie feature for   you here on peep this out reviews this time on  over at taco bell to take a look at the latest   addition to their cravings value menu that's  actually replacing a previous fan favorite but   is it any good so let's find out as we go in in  the new chicken chipotle melt and as always we've   got that standard flour tortilla let's take a look  on the inside looks like plenty of chipotle sauce   we've got some white meat grilled chicken and  cheddar cheese so definitely a nice meaty saucy   situation for sure and again it's looking pretty  decent considering it's only like a buck 29   let's see if the flavor is going to deliver on  this one it's the new chicken chipotle melt here   at taco bell let's peep out this flavor yeah this  is pretty much what i was expecting when i unwrapped   this one guys i mean it is pretty much on the  small side and you'd kind of expect it to be   it's just a little over a buck but considering  the amount of chipotle sauce on the inside this   is actually looking pretty good the grilled  chicken on the inside naturally is replacing   the shredded chicken that's actually one of the  main things about this one here i really liked   the shredded chicken personally i think it was  unlike the quesadilla melt which they actually   wrapped in foil which was pretty cool they had  a soft taco and a regular burrito but naturally   going to chunky chicken like this obviously it's  a little bit cheaper to produce i don't have to do   anything extra is just chop some chicken throw it  in the tortilla with a sauce and cheese it is what   it is right alright so before i get into this  one because it actually smells pretty good and   like always if you guys are fans of high quality  delicious looking food reviews make sure to hit   that subscribe button down below and don't forget  to tap that bell icon so you can be notified as   soon as brand new content drops every week guys  here we go one last look at it on the inside here   this is looking pretty nice here it's the chicken  chipotle melt here at taco bell let's do it   chunky ooo smoky chipotle sauce a little  bit of sizzle that's actually really good   yeah that heat is already beginning to build and  you know what this is the same chipotle sauce   they use on pretty much everything else here that  they make with it and obviously the heat level is   elevated there is a lot of it in this right now  and let me just say the addition of the chunky   chicken is not bad but i am kind of missing that  pureed chicken type of shredded goodness from   before naturally the cheese a little non-existent  it's really the chipotle sauce that's really   lighting this one up and the overall chicken  like i said chunky just okay guys just okay pretty good snack though i gotta admit well  considering the limited ingredients list on   this this is gonna be kind of a quick review i  mean it's only three main things on the inside   of a tortilla and again it's very very basic but  guys if you're a fan of taco bell you already know   you're gonna be giving this one a shot the chicken  itself is not super flavorful so it's already   losing points right there the shredded chicken  previously actually had some more to it and i   really kind of thought the distinction was really  kind of there whatever you got whether the melt   whether the burrito whether the taco regardless  this is just okay but the real standout is   definitely gonna be the chipotle sauce if  you're a fan of that anyway you're really   gonna like this and like i said for a little over  a buck a buck 29 depending upon where you're at   this is actually pretty tasty for a little quickie  snack so one more bite we'll finish this one up   after the rating but guys it's just all right you  kind of knew it was gonna be right just all right   well i think by simplifying this one they kind of  hurt it in the overall flavor department because   naturally having just a tortilla filled with  chipotle sauce is really all that i'm getting   here with the exception of feeling like i'm  actually eating some other protein there's   really no flavor to the chicken with this and that  cheese is non-existent but guys like i said for a   dollar 29 or a dollar this is actually okay for  a quickie snack and like i said if you guys are   fans of that chipotle sauce you already know this  is going to be tasty for you yeah my taco bell   flag was pretty much at half-mast when i said  they were getting rid of that shredded chicken   i mean one of the things that i would usually get  on occasion from the cravings value menu over here   was the shredded chicken quesadilla melt i really  enjoyed how they kind of wrapped that in the foil   it stayed hotter longer and it just seemed like  it was more vibrant in terms of the overall   flavor the recipe was really good this is a very  simplified version of that naturally it's not even   shredded but the chipotle sauce is really the same  ingredient that's really the main thing with this   one and like i said if you like the chipotle sauce  you're pretty much eating that on the inside of a   flour tortilla with a little bit of a mouthfeel  that you're having some protein to go with it   don't think you're going to be tasting the cheese  because there's really nothing there to speak of   even though visibly i think there was right  so with that said i'm gonna have to give the   chicken chipotle melt here a taco bell part  of their cravings value menu just in okay   7 out of 10 now would i actually get this off  camera on occasion maybe once in a while but not   nearly as much as i would have gotten the shredded  chicken because like i said guys that's really   just a flour tortilla filled with chipotle sauce  with a little bit of mouth feel for the chicken   that's in there that's pretty much it but still  just all right okay so now the obvious question   are you going to be giving this one a shot  because i'm assuming you are if you've made it   this far into the review drop some comments down  below let me know if you're going to be giving   this one a go and when it comes to the shredded  chicken how upset are you that it's off the menu   drop those comments down below and definitely  let me know and with that this is Ian K closing   out another high quality foodie feature for you  here on peep this out reviews bringing you
