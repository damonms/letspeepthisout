 what's going on everyone it's Ian K and  welcome or welcome back to the channel   where today i'm over at panda to check out  a new item they've got on their menu that   only seems to be at a few locations in my  area that's right so stay tuned because the   all-new mongolian brisket is up next welcome  to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty yeah this is super aromatic in my car right  now beautiful notes of beefy goodness along   with garlic guys feast your eyes on it here  we go with the mongolian brisket a very lovely   situation of goodness over here at panda express  and i gotta say this is looking super inviting   all right so starting off with a very tasty  base of quinoa fried rice my absolute favorite   what you're looking at here is premium brisket  and veggies wok tossed in a zesty ginger garlic   sauce and as you guys can see a very solid amount  of that brisket action along with the veggies   looks like we've got some mushrooms some green  beans some garlic some carrots it's definitely   looking pretty nice and it's filling out this  bowl nicely lots of meaty goodness for sure   guys i can't wait to get into this right  now it really looks and smells fantastic   and yeah let me just say i am super in the mood  for this right now it's been a while since i've   had something of this type of caliber over here  at panda express especially in the meat department   aside from like beef and broccoli which i really  enjoy let me grab a little bit of everything here   there are some nice pieces of brisket in here  this is actually really nice so take a look   at that we're gonna go for a little bit of the  quinoa fried rice and it looks like a green bean   as well but guys very nice on the cuts  here this is looking beautiful here we   go it's the mongolian brisket here  at panda express let's peep this out oh super tender   hold on you know as i got to the panda express  here in pasadena california they actually were   putting out a fresh batch of this as i made  my way to the counter so guys a very lovely   situation i think that makes a huge difference  here let me go for a mushroom some more quinoa   action and guys take a look at that looks like  we have some cabbage too there very nice on this   brisket it is super tender super moist and  that zesty type of sauce that it's got the   ginger garlic action is dovetailing beautifully  with everything let's keep going in this is tasty wow this is worth the two dollar up charge  by far very tasty on this and guys again   look at the cuts on that brisket action  that is beautifully cooked as you can see   lovely color on this one here the very ends  of it but that saucy goodness is beautiful you can pull it apart really really flavorful  guys just more money shots galore for you to   check out here very very tasty very tasty  mmm you know what let's do a little bit more   of that quinoa action i really love the grains  with this it's all the usual fried rice goodies   but mixed with quinoa it's such a nice  alternative and a little bit better for   you at the same time nothing against regular  fried rice i love regular fried rice but the   quinoa is banging if you have it available over  here at panda pretty good let's keep going in mmm wow this is a real tasty show piece of some  panda goodness guys i have to say the brisket is   amazing with this those flavors are pretty awesome  and again it really helps that it was freshly made   i got there like i said just as they were putting  out a fresh batch and it makes a huge difference   but there is plenty of flavor in this and it goes  so beautifully with your base of choice obviously   you can do the chow mein the fried rice but again  quinoa is banging and it goes beautifully with   this very nice yeah i'm super glad to be checking  this one out guys and truth be told i mean i do   have the innovation kitchen in pasadena which is  not where i got this one ironically so they're   actually they test a few of these things around  here once in a while but naturally i really didn't   see this available in a widespread area when i  was checking the app it's only in about three or   four in my area here in pasadena so i hope this  gets a little bit wider because i would like to   get this if i happen to be out somewhere and i see  panda and not have to worry about going someplace   specific but guys it's worth looking for this look  in the app and see if you've got this this is very   tasty let's go for some of these onions here  this is looking and smelling great already again it's just so pungent in the car so tasty and  guys look at this mushroom super cut lovely   thick action definitely nice that garlic ginger  sauce is all over this really good mmm wow   all right so let me grab one more cut of this  brisket action here and some more of that quinoa   action as well before we wrap the review up  with the rating coming up next but a very tasty   alternative is it's all falling apart but guys the  brisket is the main star of the show this is very   very tasty and i really hope this stays around  for a bit again totally worth the upcharge and   the flavor is awesome on this very tasty and  oh yeah let me take that final bite hang on so good all right here's another quick shot for  you and again just coming back to the price point   with this one it is a little bit of an upcharge  like i mentioned earlier and considering the bowl   itself is about eight dollars now you're looking  at well over ten dollars plus tax for this so   welcome to inflation in 2022 but at the same  time the quality is worth it and that's really   where this one stands out thankfully it delivers  on taste and i gotta say a very nice heavy-handed   portion of that mongolian brisket action this is  definitely something to check out on the panda   app in your area i'd highly recommend it so with  that said i'm gonna have to give the new mongolian   brisket here at panda express an awesome 9 out  of 10 guys really the only thing hurting this   one is the price point but again that's really the  case with just about everywhere you go these days   the prices are just higher but naturally with  the upcharge being only two dollars if the bowl   is a little bit less expensive naturally i mean  the price point of this right now is almost like   the old version of the two item plates and it's  getting up there so naturally it is what it is   but like i said the quality of the flavor delivers  on that one and that's really where it counts very   very tasty and i really hope they've got this in  your area it's definitely worth checking out which   segues me into asking you guys have you checked  the app do you actually have the mongolian brisket   available at a location close to you you may have  to kind of look at a few but it is actually there   at least here in southern cali well pasadena  anyway about two or three locations only drop   those comments down below let me know if you were  able to find this one and if you did give it a   shot what did you think about it again drop those  comments down below and definitely let me know   and with that this is Ian K closing out another  high quality foodie feature for you here on peep   this out reviews bringing you brand new content  every single week here on my channel so while you stay   tuned for that next review coming real soon in the  meantime stay frosty yeah at over ten dollars   for this one it's a little bit of a stretch  for the bowl but guys like i said the flavor   does deliver it is worth checking out alright  everyone until next time i'll talk to you soon   hey thanks for checking out another  one of my reviews but just in case you   didn't see the one before this one  you can find it right up over here   along what i think youtube's gonna recommend  for you to check out as well as always i think   you'll find something like in both of them and  i'll definitely catch you in the next one see ya
