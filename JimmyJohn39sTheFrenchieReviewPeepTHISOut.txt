 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty it's my first time visiting Jimmy John's gourmet sandwiches and for this inaugural review I thought I'd go a little international well so to speak that's right we're getting French inspired as we go in on the Frenchie brand new for a limited time only here at Jimmy John's gourmet sandwiches and let me just say I'm having a lot of trouble keeping this over 13-inch baguette in frame here guys it's looking really really cool actually feast your eyes on exactly what we've got here a fairly thin sandwich but I got to say it is definitely packed on the inside with some goodness here very long in the baguette department as you can see and they definitely baked this fresh guys it really is very very nicely done lemme see if I can split this for ya and give you a better look on the inside we've got some folded all-natural salami we've got some capicola some provolone cheese and up against the edges we have some salted butter but guys a very decent amount of meat especially for the price of this right now and the smell is definitely very fresh you can smell it very nicely in my car so very cool in the authenticity department because of the baguette itself but I have to say guys again the length is really really cool on this just let me pull back take a look at the length of that that is just really really nice let's see if the flavor overall delivers because the presentation is pretty cool it's the all-new Frenchie here at jimmy john's gourmet sandwiches let's peep out this flavor so if you're a fan of high quality

into this one it's the Frenchie from Jimmy John's gourmet sandwiches and again the smell is absolutely inviting on this one here we go right off the break the light toastiness have this freshly made baguette really sets the tone guys and then it gets nice and soft and then all the other flavors begin to spring into action most notably the saltiness that I'm getting from the butter it's a nice combination this is still pretty warm actually and then the nice salami and capicola flavors along with that provolone this is just a very very tasty sandwich like snack because it's very thin but very long let's keep going guys this is really good so far mmm man yup it's got a nice amount of thickness to the folded meat in the very middle here and again that baguette is really setting the tone because of how nice and crispy it is on the outside and the softness as you get further in it's got some denseness to it and then of course of the cheese and have salted butter very simple ingredients list on this one but guys a very flavorful one at that really really nice and as you can see in front of you right now this was pretty much made with a lot of tender loving care starting off with roughly a 26 inch baguette itself that was lathered up very nicely with salted butter and then filled out with a hearty amount of all-natural salami and capicola along with that provolone cheese before it's sliced up in the middle and then wrapped up good to go and I have to say guys I really loved the presentation and hey I'm really digging this packaging with the checkerboard paper along with that sticker on the outside it feels like something you would find in like a French cafe itself like on the countertop which is essentially the way they have these at Jimmy John's you pretty much pull them good to go but if you see 'em definitely grab one because these are in limited supply considering they have to make the baguettes fresh and they do take a little bit of time but guys a very nice presentation and very nice flavor overall let's go for one more bite hmm I'm so glad I did this right now let me give you another fast look on the inside a nice amount of capicola and that all-natural salami along with the provolone cheese and the butter that's soaking into the inside of this baguette is pretty awesome guys and as you can see by the light cracks on the outside nice crispiness on this freshly made baguette and nice quality overall very very delicious and well worth the price of admission so as I mentioned at the top of this review this is my very first time giving Jimmy John's a shot so I'm really glad that I actually went the international route so to speak because truth be told this only wets my appetite to try some other options on the menu but guys as it stands a very very solid sandwich with this Frenchie and like I said the quality was very high and again the price point you really can't beat that it sure is a pretty nice sized overall sandwich for the money so with that said I'm gonna have to give the Frenchie here at Jimmy John's gourmet sandwiches a rock solid 10 out of 10 The price is right the flavor is on point and the authenticity was absolutely there on top of a very cool presentation and a very well way to sell it to you by sitting on the counter guys I have to admit I really like that so make sure you pick one up if you see 'em I don't think you're gonna be disappointed but as always it's gonna segue into what I'm gonna ask you right now are you gonna give this one a shot drop some comments down below let
