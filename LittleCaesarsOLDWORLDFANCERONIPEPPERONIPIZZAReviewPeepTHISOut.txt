 what's going on everyone and welcome to the  channel it's Ian K where today i'm headed   into little caesars because it looks like  their pepperoni is turning into fanceroni   for their latest promo i see you little caesars  you're all fancy now huh so stay tuned because   the old world fanceroni pepperoni pizza is up  next welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K   stay frosty pizza pizza man oh man this is  definitely pepperoni overload guys take a   closer look at what i'm checking out here here  we go with the old world fanceroni pepperoni and   as you can see there is no shortage of the star  of the attraction for this one guys definitely   a nicely top pizza for sure alright so basically  what you've got here is a large pepperoni pizza   topped with over 100 crispy old world pepperonis  essentially the cup pepperonis that have the oil   that pools right there in the middle guys the  flavor is definitely going to be there for sure   and all of them stretch from edge to edge on top  of all of that cheese and the sauce underneath as   well it's definitely looking pretty plentiful in  most departments for sure but guys the main draw   with this one aside from that is it supposed  to have a crispy caramelized crust and while   i'm not seeing too much of that there's just  little hints of it i gotta say the pepperoni   is still looking pretty killer on this so  let's not waste any more time on this one   this is the new old world fanceroni pepperoni  from little caesars let's peep out this flavor   yeah definitely a lot of pepperoni on this  one guys they are not playing around this   looks really fantastic and for $9.99 not too bad on  this whatsoever all right let me put this one down   and we will pull up a slice here real quick  and wow right off the bat i expected this this   is going to be very very greasy guys the whole  bottom of this is completely wet with pepperoni   grease but as you can see very gluttonous just  take a look at those curled up pepperonis right   there there was no shortage of them and i am  totally digging the amount of cheese this one   has here already looking really awesome let's  not waste any more time for the second time here   we go with the old world fanceroni pepperoni  pizza from little caesars let's peep this out mmm crispy but a ton of grease and oil on this  wow crazy flavor though and i guess you kind of   expected that with the amount of pepperoni this  one has guys very very tasty they are very nice   mmm but wow the salt is off the chart with  this one though crazy crazy but a very   lovely situation of those crispy goodness  pieces right over there just look at that   right there in the middle all the oily goodness  that's housed in there the little flavor pockets   for sure with lots of the classic little caesars  flavor here the sauce the cheese very familiar   but guys again the caramelization of  the crust is a little non-existent   on this so it's going to have  to be docked because of that   but still a very tasty pepperoni pizza  very very tasty let's keep going in no shortage of pepperoni that's crazy yeah this is  a crazy salt bomb guys i mean i'm getting a lot of   nice spicing from the pepperonis themselves and  the oils are definitely on point with this one i   mean they're really in excess and overload but  with the cheesy goodness that this one has got   with a semi-toasted crust it's not bad as well but  again hardly any caramelization in the very back   here and since we're talking about that real quick  let me go for a quick bite of that yeah it needs   a little bit of cheese in the back there to kind  of stay with its advertising with the caramelized   crust but it's good man this is so crazy oily  though just keep going in for another few more well as i'm getting further into this one  all i keep thinking about is this really   does feel like a super upgraded extra most  bestest pizza i mean i think that pizza has   originally like 50 plus slices of regular  pepperoni with this one being a hundred   because maybe they're a little bit smaller they  want to pack more onto it it's really in excess   of what that is i gotta say guys so extra most  best is 2.0, 3.0 whatever you want to call it   but with the old world style of the goodies  here and again be prepared i probably should   have brought something to drink with me today i  didn't think it was going to be this crazy salty   but at the same time i really wish that i had  something to wash this one down with let's go   for another couple on it guys it is pretty tasty  though still but just be prepared it's very salty that cheese blend is pretty banging and although  pepperoni is not my all-time favorite pizza   topping which i've said so many times throughout  my little caesars reviews whenever i do pepperoni   naturally i can appreciate why people do dig it  and especially the old world style because of   all the oils that pull up in the crispy edges of  the pepperoni themselves so i can appreciate that   but at the same time i would love to see  something like this with a ton of sausage maybe   that would be kind of cool i mean they do have  the extra most bestest sausage which i reviewed   you're probably seeing that review on  your screen here right now maybe an   upgraded version of that in some possible  way but for what this is guys i gotta say   the advertising looks really cool with it it  was a lot of fun to pick up through the pizza   portal as well i have a lot of fun doing that  whenever i pick up my pizza at little caesars   and like i said well i can appreciate while peeps  really dig this this is not really my cup of tea   as something i would get again but still very  very tasty but again very greasy at the same time   so let's go for one more bite we'll knock this  review out with the rating coming up next but guys   another awesome pizza over here little caesars  just have plenty of napkins on hand and something   to drink to go with it guys but still pretty  tasty one more bite and we'll close it out hang on yeah pepperoni heads are definitely gonna dig  this one for sure and at $9.99 this is not a   bad value overall guys you're getting a ton of  pepperoni well over a hundred plus all covered   on the top of this pizza and considering the  inflation situation in our country right now   you're still getting a lot for the money here guys  very tasty very flavorful and it really is classic   little caesars mixed with a little old world flair  thanks to those pepperonis on top pretty tasty   pizza pizza well this one sure has a pretty fun  name guys i mean fanceroni pepperoni is pretty   eye-catching when you see it at first glance so  it really is unique to little caesars and they   definitely have fun with that kind of like the  batman calzony or just the calzony in general   pretty fun name indeed and like i said while the  pepperoni is not necessarily my all-time favorite   topping over here at little caesars or on pizza in  general i can appreciate why you guys definitely   would probably dig this one especially if you  made it this far into the review guys it still   is a pretty tasty pizza alright so with that  said i'm going to have to give this new old   world fancironi pepperoni aka the upgraded extra  most bestest 2.0, 3.0 whatever you want to call it   a pretty decent 7.5 out of 10 and  i'm not going to go much higher than that guys   because essentially what i've got here is the  regular pepperoni pizza minus the caramelized   edges that i really wish i could have tried that  was one of the main things about this one but at   the same time what is there actually tastes very  very good aside from being oily being a little bit   more on the greasier side scratch that a lot on  the greasier side those old world pepperonis are   super plentiful it looks amazing and it was a lot  of fun to film for sure but guys again i wish i   could have had just a little bit more of a rounded  out picture with this one as advertised but still   very very tasty and definitely worth checking  out at least once or a few times if a lot of you   pepperoni heads dig it which i eventually guess  you're probably going to so do me a quick favor   let's segue into it drop some comments down below  let me know if you're going to be giving this   old world fanceroni pepperoni pizza shot over  here little caesars and if you do give it a go   what did you think about it overall drop those  comments down below and definitely let me know   and with that this is Ian K closing
