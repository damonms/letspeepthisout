ado let's peep this out meatoberfest is in full swing here at Arby's and as you already know we're going in on the beer cheese triple stack and definitely a super meaty situation here guys as expected here at Arby's you got to go for the big guns so I wanted to go for all three meats under what's supposed to be a really cool-looking pretzel bun and I got to say I'm definitely digging that already there gotta love that cross cut nice and toasty nice and soft for sure let's pop this and take a look underneath you've got some crispy onions a mixture of mustard and beer cheese and if you take a look right there in the middle we've got some beer braised beef looking very nice guys and corned beef actually is in there as well I've actually never had the corned beef here at Arby's so I'm looking forward to see what that's gonna do with the flavor overall and of course you've got some roast beef on the very bottom there as well too let's take a look underneath further and it looks like we've got some more of that cheesy goodness maybe a little bit more of the mustard mixed in with it guys but the smell is definitely awesome and I have to admit having something other than a star cross bun is definitely a plus right there with meatoberfest in effect aka Oktoberfest pretzels are all the rage right now and I'm absolutely into that I love soft pretzels but this looks pretty fantastic let's give this a go it's the beer cheese triple stack for a limited time only here at Arby's let's peep out this flavor well let me start off by saying from October on is definitely my favorite time of the year I mean Halloween is my all-time favorite it's right around the corner and naturally with Oktoberfest in effect aka meatoberfest good one on the marketing there Arby's is more of a chance of seeing soft pretzel bun type sandwiches making an appearance around this time of the year and than other time so I'm definitely down with that can't wait to get into this one right now but first off if you guys are fans of high quality delicious looking food reviews which I think most of you are is that subscribe button down below and don't forget to tap the Bell icon so you keep notified as soon as new content drops every week so guys beer cheese goodness soft pretzel goodness it's the beer cheese triple stack here at Arby's let's do this right now mmm oh wow mm-hmm first off the saltiness of the crispy onions and the softness of the pretzel bun immediately dovetail into the beer cheese and the roast beef and then the braised beef which is actually coming through nicely not getting the corned beef just yet but guys very flavorful and I love the softness of this pretzel bun this is pretty awesome right now let's go for another bite I'll give you that close-up mm-hmm well I wanted to know if the pretzel bun here at Arby's was the truth and let me confirm it for you it is absolutely delicious the nice softness you get as you bite down into it with the light crispiness at the very end really sets the tone for all the meaty goodness you're about to get into with this one the crispy onions light it up immediately then into the cheese and then into the meat and I got to say the selection of meats on this one is pretty awesome guys that braised beef very flavorful very savory and it goes very nicely with the roast beef itself guys a really really delicious sandwich so far you know it's all the stuff that Arby's does really well and what they also do very well is supply you with a nice sandwich diaper in there very back guys because there's a lot coming on with this one I've got a lot of cheese and a lot of stuff falling out the back but nice quality overall and I have to say the beer braised marinated beef is a lovely situation it's smooth its tender and the quality is nice very rich flavor on that too and when you combine that with the soft toastiness of the pretzel bun which I'm really diggin the quality of it I really love the feel of this one here you're getting a lot of heartiness when you bite into this one and of course the crispy onions I'm not really tasting any real mustard though that's the only thing but it is definitely cheesy and the quality of the meats is awesome guys but still no corned beef yet I wonder if I have just a little less compared to everything else it looks like I kind of do and I'm okay with that there's more roast beef on this right now along with the braised beef but you know what let's see if we can kick a little bit more flavor up and go with my all-time favorite horsey sauce let's do it pretzel bun action front and center for you guys as we light this one up with some horsey sauce right here for this bite lovely situation I think we're about to get into what do you guys think yeah I think it's about to be a very lovely situation let's dive in mm-hmm man oh yeah and yes I finally got some corned beef in that bite and I gotta say I'm absolutely loving that guys it's almost like a rich smooth creamy type of meat and it really adds a nice dimension to the overall light chew and softness of the braised beef itself great stuff that's really good all right let me go for one more bite of this lusciousness before the final close-up and then we'll wrap this one up so tasty mmm all right we're going 360 with this one just so I can show you what I'm working with from the back and as you can see the corned beef is kind of hanging out in the back mostly that's why I really wasn't getting it early on but as you can see the crispy onions plenty of that beer cheese mustard combo even though it's mostly cheese I'm not really tasting mustard I'm okay with that but as you can see lots of meat here guys the triple stack in this form is absolutely amazing and when you add the awesomeness and the authenticity of that pretzel bun on top of it you got a really tasty sandwich guys it's what Arby's does very well and if you ask me it's perfect for their meatoberfest promo well it couldn't really taste the mustard on that one but thankfully the beer cheese itself was just strong enough to really let me know that it was there and the quality of it is pretty good guys it's a light saltiness and the creaminess is awesome it goes amazingly well with the meats in general and with the braised beef on top of the guy's easy recommendation along with the roast beef and finally the corned beef at the very end I probably should have distributed to me just a little bit in the beginning but guys delicious stuff all around when you do get to it it's complimented very nicely with that pretzel bun really awesome stuff so with that said I'm gonna have to give the beer cheese triple stack as part of meatoberfest here at Arby's a rock-solid 9 out of 10 you want to know how to improve this sandwich just a little bit add a little bit more cheese and maybe make the mustard just a little bit more pronounced but other than that the quality is amazing guys just the right amount of crispy onions on that and that pretzel bun really sets the tone just a delicious sandwich overall how could you not want to give this a try right well obviously I think most of you are gonna let me know right now drop some comments down below if you're gonna be giving this one a go and if you are how excited are you to give that pretzel bun a shot over here at Arby's I was pretty excited
