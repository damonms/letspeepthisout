 what's going on everyone and welcome or welcome  back to the channel it's Ian K where today i've   returned to carl's jr to check out the other new  item off of their all new gold digger menu that's   right and you already know so stay tuned because  the gold digger double cheeseburger is up next   welcome to peep this out  reviews with ian K stay frosty all right it's round two of the gold digger  action over here at carl's jr guys with their   all new gold digger double cheeseburger and guys  what we've got here is some value-sized goodness   and i gotta say that kind of goes against the gold  digger theme with this one but we've got a really   nice little value cheeseburger over here a double  with some pretty nice looking features let's break   this one down real quick alright so it's value  size flavor lit by fire over here at carl's jr and   starting off with a very nice semi-toasted regular  style bun on this one guys let's pop it and take   a look underneath what we've got here is a very  decent amount of that carolina gold barbecue sauce   action and of course as we pan down you're gonna  see it's on top of two crispy pieces of bacon   essentially one strip split in half and there's  plenty of that sauce to go with and guys that's   sitting on two 100% beef patties on top of it not  bad in the presentation department i gotta say   and they're split very nicely with that slice of  american cheese right there as well underneath it   we've got the usual finishing items lettuce tomato  pickles and mayo but guys it's all coming back to   what this one is supposed to be and essentially  that gold digger theme is really kind of playing   with my head just a bit considering this is a  value burger but even still it's looking pretty   awesome alright so there you go it's the all-new  gold digger double cheeseburger here at carl's   jr let's peep out this flavor so yeah i'm not  saying she's a gold digger and while carl's jr   is definitely doing that i don't think she would  actually go with this particular one personally   because it's kind of on the small side still  but guys it still looks pretty awesome and i   gotta say the presentation is pretty nice i'm  getting some real nice aroma from the carolina   gold barbecue sauce and still like i said the  presentation not too bad on this one so let's   confirm the goodness it's the all-new gold digger  double cheeseburger here at carl's jr let's do it that goes good with the beef wow yeah she take  my money what carl's jr did guys this is actually   pretty tasty in the flavor department so i'm  not really minding that one bit the flavor of   the patties goes beautifully with that carolina  gold barbecue sauce action it's like a smoky   honey mustard but with that barbecue flair and  it goes amazing with the beef as you'd expect   of course all the crunch with all the goodness on  the bottom the pickles especially a highlight and   i gotta say it's really drowning out that tomato  action i'm not minding that one bit along with the   smokiness of the bacon to go with not bad on this  one but again gold digger it's really playing with   my head why is this called a gold digger burger i  mean naturally the carolina gold barbecue sauce it   is what it is carl's jr please if you're watching  this right now drop a comment down below educate   the masses as well as myself i'd love to know why  you're calling this a gold digger at the same time   but still it's classic carl's jr flavor on top of  it guys with really really beautiful smoky flavor   coming from that honey mustard like carolina  gold barbecue sauce and i got to say the   presentation again very inviting let's go  for another couple on this one pretty tasty that pickle is amazing with the sauce  that's nice well whoever made my burger   god bless you because you really loaded up the  pickles beautifully on the bottom right there   that is a beautiful situation and that's really  adding to the overall experience with this one   but as you can see the value size goodness  from what i'm getting here does deliver a very   solid flavor profile across the board as you'd  expect it to with this carolina gold barbecue   sauce and the smokiness of that bacon again  very nice on display for you here right now   and those pickles are really adding  overall again very nice combo on this   yeah i'm kind of surprised this is actually not  on one of their flagship angus burgers over here   guys because i can really see the thickness of  that meat going beautifully across the board but   i guess they wanted to give a value menu item  a little bit of a bump so to speak because of   the quality of the sauce if you guys haven't  checked out the hand breaded chicken sandwich   that i just did take a look at that review popping  up on your screen right now that was a beautiful   combination of freshly made hand breaded  goodness on top of the barbecue sauce that   came with this guys and i got to say that was  really really fun to do definitely check that   one out but guys when it comes to this again  i'm really wishing this was just a bigger burger   with more thicker meat because like i said the  quality of the sauce goes amazing with the beef   and of course with all the crunchiness on the  bottom of this one as well it's adding beautifully   those pickles are really really nice on this  one so let's go for one more bite on this one   we'll wrap the review up with the rating coming up  next but guys a very solid value here in southern   cali it's about $3.49 for this i believe the average  around the country is about $2.99 50 cents over not   too bad but again the quality is with singing on  this one one more bite we'll close it out hang on well the vibrancy of that carolina gold barbecue  sauce is definitely drowning out the flavor of   the cheese that's holding these two patties  together but that's quite all right because   i'm still getting that creamy mouthfeel with this  one on top of all the other flavors so like i said   a really awesome flavor profile with this and i  gotta say it really works very very nicely even if   it's slightly above the value price point it does  deliver some pretty awesome flavor pretty nice on   this all right so with that said i'm gonna have  to give the in name only as far as i'm concerned   gold digger double cheeseburger here at carl's jr  a pretty solid 8 out of 10 guys like i said   all throughout this review the flavor combination  of that carolina gold barbecue sauce along with   the charbroiled beef over here at carl's jr is a  major highlight on this one it really goes very   nicely add in the smokiness of the bacon and of  course all the other crunchy goodies on that one   especially the pickles and you've got a pretty  decent value for what you've got over here a   little over $2.99 here in southern cali $3.49 it's  still a pretty decent value but nowhere near the   gold digger name as far as i'm concerned but  even still something worth checking out and   obviously i would love to see that sauce on a  much thicker piece of meat over here but even   still what i've got today was still pretty  flavorful all right so if you've got carl's   jr in the area do me a quick favor drop some  comments down below would you pay $2.99 or even   $3.49 for something like this today i mean did  this actually look like it was worth it to you   drop those comments down below and definitely  let me know and with that this is Ian K closing   out another high quality foodie feature for you  here on peep this out reviews bringing you brand   new content every single week here on my channel  so while you stay tuned for that next review coming real
