 hey everyone I'm back at it this time over at Papa John's yet again to check out another one of their Papdias and this time we're going a little bit more traditional with the meatball pepperoni so stay tuned because it's up next welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty I think I've got more handheld happiness on deck thanks to Papa John's with this all-new meatball pepperoni Papadia this is looking nice and toasty guys maybe a little bit more toasty than the Philly cheese I did not that long ago but I think this is gonna fit the mold considering the flavor that we're going in on take a look on the inside of this one here let me lift this up wow that is lovely a lovely situation here we've got some pepperoni there whole pieces of meatball guys cut in half plenty of cheese plenty of pizza sauce right there that is looking nice that's what the other one up here just take a fast look yeah that is a lovely situation guys I'm trying not to steam up my camera lens here but that is a lot of meaty cheesy goodness a traditional pizza style sandwich quesadilla whatever you want to call it it is flipped over it is crispy it is toasty and of course for dipping how could you not go with a side of pizza sauce here that marinara goodness to dip into looking really tasty on this one guys let's give it a go and see if the flavor's gonna deliver its the meatball pepperoni Papadia here at Papa John's let's peep out this flavor get a new Papadia for six bucks yeah I'm definitely a fan of meatball on pizza for sure guys even more so than pepperoni so the fact that I'm getting pepperoni and meatball together on the inside that's gonna be a lovely combination in general and I'm glad I'm going the more traditional route this time out because this really seems a little bit more traditional when you think about it it's more like an open-faced pizza with meatball and pepperoni just flipped over so as this is beginning to burn my fingers here and real quick

this mmm thick meatball the cheese is dense the pepperoni the light spicing coming up on the back end man the toastiness of that dough that is a lovely situation and I love the fact that it's a thin crust man that delicious that was a heck of a first bite so let me go for another one before I give you this next close-up guys because I really want to it's delicious mmm no small meatball chunks on this one guys I'm loving the fact that they are actually meatballs cut in half and they really are nice and dense when you bite into them just look at the thickness of that right there the pepperoni is a nice accent so this is really a meatball show but I'm loving the fact that the cheese is singing with it the pizza sauce and the overall crispiness the little over crispiness of the crust this timeout is really adding to the experience this is just really really delicious and it's such a simple ingredients list with this one and that's not necessarily a bad thing because sometimes simplicity is the way to go it's just meat cheese the sauce that thinness of that crust which is really awesome essentially like I said a small pizza flipped over cut in half you got a whole new product line right here you can do so many different flavors of this one and I really hope they do more than just the main ones that are available let's go for another bite and we're definitely going for a dip in that dipping sauce you know we're hitting that up let's do it alright let me dip the crust into this one cuz it's the easiest way to do it and as you can see I've got some meat right there on the back so this is gonna be a lovely situation I think and I'm loving how thick this marinara sauce is as I'm swirling this around here let's give this a go I'm diving in right now yeah and you better believe I'm not hesitating either let's do it mmm-hmm gotta be honest it's just okay with that you know the flavor of this marinara actually feels like it's got roma tomatoes in it for some reason so the taste is just a little bit different it doesn't really taste like traditional pizza sauce and I don't really know if that pairs very nicely with what I'm having here right now because the flavors actually stand out more with the meat and the cheese and all this goodness which is fine but I'm not sure if I like the marinara sauce as a dipping option with this particular one I think the light amount of sauce this actually has on its own is all you really need so I'm glad I have something to try with this naturally but on its own it's probably the way that I would go of course if I had some of that garlic dipping sauce to go with this one I think this would have been euphoric but as it stands I can see why they pair it with the marinara but it's just ok with it let me go for one more little dip with this one we'll give you another close-up as a final shot before we wrap this up with the rating and then we'll just continue on let's do it mmm all right so this is a fun one to check out because my love for meatball is definitely up there so I was very excited to give this one a go and thankfully there is no shortage of it on the inside even though this half does have a little bit less compared to the other one but as you can see guys it is a very delicious situation here you can't go wrong with the pizza ingredients with this one and again that's sauce I don't know if I would do it as a dipping option but your mileage may vary but still a very delicious version of this papadia and I'm glad I checked it out so with that said I'm gonna have to give the meatball pepperoni Papadia here at Papa John's a pretty solid 8.2 out of 10 it's just over eight because the quality of the meatballs naturally are definitely up there I love the fact that their whole slices of meatball in that along with the pepperoni and overall it's a nice combination a classic combination that I think many of you guys have had in the past before if you've had a meatball sub chances our pepperoni is a nice addition to anything that you put that with so for me just over eight is fair even with that marinara sauce which is not exactly my favorite I'm glad there's an option that come with it but naturally I think this would be even better with that garlic dipping sauce everything pretty much is here now the question is is this version of the Papadia that I reviewed right now something that you want to try with or without the garlic sauce even though I would recommend with naturally and I may actually do that again off camera but drop some comments down below let me know what you actually thought of this flavor are you a fan of meatball and pepperoni together drop those comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K closing out another
