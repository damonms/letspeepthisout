K stay frosty all right so let's get this party started because  this thing is smelling pretty awesome already   guys feast your eyes on the steak nacho fries  burrito an absolutely loaded situation we have   in front of us here right now guys and i have  to say i am totally digging the amount of fries   and steak to go with let's break this one down  all right so what we've got on the inside of   this oversized warm tortilla is a very solid  amount of seasoned steak nacho cheese sauce   chipotle sauce shredded cheddar cheese reduced  fat sour cream diced tomatoes and of course the   main star of the show seasoned nacho fries  to go along with that steak and guys again   a very substantial looking situation with this  one and i gotta say the aroma is lighting up   my car with all the classic flavors of taco  bell you can definitely smell it pretty nicely   so let's not waste any more time on this one  i can't wait to sink my teeth into what we've   got here this is the steak nacho fries burrito  here at taco bell let's peep out this flavor   yeah this is definitely a lovely visual  representation of the goodness right here guys   that cross-section shot is looking pretty awesome  with all of the ingredients on display plenty of   steak and a pretty decent amount of those nacho  fries as well so let me see if i can confirm the   goodness for you it's the all-new steak nacho  fries burrito here at taco bell let's do it oh yeah this is some tasty taco bell goodness   right now guys and i gotta say with  the addition of that chipotle sauce   on top of the bold mexican spices that you're  getting with those nacho fries in general   they're very tasty and obviously there's a reason  they keep coming back i gotta say the combination   is mixing beautifully let's go for another few  more bites in this guys this is pretty tasty mmm well it's a very carby situation as you'd  expect it to be considering the tortilla and   all the fries on the inside of this guys but when  you're getting the nice amount of light heat that   i'm getting from the seasoning and everything else  in here with the nacho cheese sauce to reduce fat   sour cream and the seasoning from the steak it's  a very pleasurable experience and very hearty to   dive into guys as you can see all the classic  flavors of taco bell they mix very nicely as   you'd expect them to and obviously with the return  of the nacho fries those go pretty nicely with it   yeah shout outs to my local team over at  the taco bell on colorado boulevard guys   let me just say this is definitely a beautiful  situation the way this is made here right now   everything is pretty awesome everything is  very plentiful on the inside and i gotta say   it almost looks like the poster on the  drive through and i have to say again   with the quality of what i've got here right  now this is pretty much all of those awesome   flavors of taco bell that you know and love  with the addition of the nacho fried goodness   with this so i'm totally digging it let's go  for a couple more bites it's pretty banging man i dig it there's something about reduced fat  sour cream along with the chipotle sauce you're   getting a little bit of the coolness a little  bit of the heat to go with but the flavor is so   rich and vibrant along with everything else on the  inside pretty nice guys pretty nice you know and   correct me if i'm wrong down in the comments but  i think this is the third iteration of a steak and   nacho fries combination together over here at taco  bell back in the day i believe they had the reaper   ranch burrito with the steak variant naturally  as well as i believe it was the steak rattlesnake   fries burrito i think that was the only other one  besides this one that i'm having right now so this   one may feel like the generic name for what it is  but the quality of it is pretty tasty and there's   a plentiful amount of the steak to go with so i  guess the wild card with this one is the chipotle   sauce that it's got on the inside and i'm totally  digging that because it goes beautifully with the   nacho cheese sauce as well as the shredded  cheddar cheese everything together in one   you can get it along with the hearty bite and the  mouthfeel of the fries and that steak together so   a pretty banging situation all around all right  so let's go for one more bite on this one before   we wrap the review up with the rating coming  up next but guys another banger of a situation   over here at taco bell while it's a little bit  on the familiar side the quantity of everything   you're getting on the inside of this is not bad  for about four bucks here in southern cali this   is a pretty delicious situation and a hearty one  at that one more bite we'll close it out hang up yes sir i do love me some tasty taco bell goodness  and this is no exception all the way around the   board with this one guys you're getting a very  nice flavor profile along with the seasoned nacho   fries of course the steak is really really tasty  with this one and with the chipotle sauce and the   reduced fat sour cream the nacho cheese sauce the  shredded cheddar cheese everything on the inside   of a warm tortilla this is definitely satisfying  definitely a banging situation along with being   fairly sizable pretty nice order ahead and  pick yours up at our contactless drive-thru yup   definitely pretty tasty on this one and aside from  it being a little on the carbier side and again   naturally you'd expect that with fries inside of  a tortilla everything else in that really sings   in the flavor department i'm totally digging the  overall flavor of everything on the inside of that   and like i said it was pretty hearty and pretty  sizable for the money so definitely worth checking   out so with that said i'm gonna have to give this  new feeling nacho steak fries burrito here at taco   bell are pretty rock solid 8.5 out of 10 and guys like i have to say that score   really says something because typically i don't go  above a 7 or so when it comes to some of these   things at taco bell naturally because they're  very familiar flavors but the combination of   the steak along with those nacho fries and the  chipotle sauce was a primo flavor profile and   considering how much was packed into there on top  of it it really felt like it was substantial not   only in flavor but a pretty decent value for the  money it was pretty sizable pretty good feeling   in the hand and i gotta say again hearty hearty  hearty across the board really really great stuff   all right this is your time to shine do me a  favor and drop some comments down below let me   know if you're going to be giving this one  a shot over here at taco bell or if you're   really one of the types that just wants to  go with the nacho fries directly of course   that's available on the menu right now along with  the cheese sauce but how excited are you to try   this variant with the steak in a burrito form  drop those comments down below and definitely   let me know and with that this is Ian K closing  out another high quality foodie feature for you   here on peep this out reviews bringing you brand  new content every single week here on my channel   so while you stay tuned for that next review  coming real soon in the meantime stay frosty well   i gotta say definitely no hot sauce required at  least in my opinion with this one guys it's got   the right amount of sizzle across the board but  should you want to lace this one with some
