 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty what's going on everyone and welcome to the  channel where today i've hit up good old del   taco because it looks like mexican sandwiches  a.k.a tortas have debuted on their menu for the   first time ever and i gotta say they're looking  pretty epic and pretty cheesy too guys feast your   eyes on what i've got here for you today it's  the carne asada and queso epic torta and guys i   gotta say loaded with cheese is an understatement  this is looking pretty awesome let's break this   one on down real fast yeah the hype is looking  pretty real on this one so what we've got here   is a seven inch toasted signature roll filled  with grilled carne asada creamy queso blanco   grated cheddar cheese and pico de gallo and guys  the presentation of all that together is looking   very hearty this looks like a mexican sub sandwich  and i gotta say it's definitely got some length   it's got some weight and it looks like it's got  some really awesome stuff to satisfy so let's   not waste any more time on this one let's see if  it's gonna ultimately deliver this is the all-new   carne asada and queso epic torta here at del taco  let's peep out this flavor yeah this is definitely   a fast food first guys the very first fast food  torta i gotta say this is looking really really   awesome i'm totally digging the toastiness of the  bread here you can really tell this is very fresh   in the hands totally digging the nice flour bottom  on this one here as well it's feeling really nice   but guys it's filled with plenty of cheesy meaty  goodness i can't wait to get into it enough   talking here we go it's the carne asada and queso  epic torta here at del taco let's peep this out loaded with cheese whoa right off the break the  creamy queso blanco guys that is a beautiful   situation it's got just the right amount of  saltiness and when you mix in the nice tartness   that i'm getting believe it or not and the  sharpness combined with that along with the grated   cheddar cheese a lovely situation and then you  get into the carne asada and as you can see pretty   decent on this one guys haven't gotten to the pico  just yet and that's perfectly fine by me it's not   my favorite but i'm totally digging the amount of  cheese you can see it on the inside of that look   at that as i'm squeezing it there is a lot of good  stuff let's keep going in guys very tasty on this man this is so hearty to eat wow let me crack  this one open so you can get a better look on   the inside guys there is no shortage of cheese  whether it's quesa blanco or the grated cheddar   in there it's kind of melting all together  but wow look at all of that meat action it's   a very simple ingredients list on this one but  i gotta say it is very gluttonous very delicious   and it goes pretty amazing with that toasted roll  pretty awesome yeah i had a feeling this was going   to be a flavor showcase right off the gate guys  and honestly there's a couple of other ones they   have on the menu i'm kind of curious about as  well so stay tuned for those as time goes by a   very lovely situation in terms of the presentation  and there's one with guacamole which i think i'm   going to save for last it looks pretty awesome but  guys with this again a lovely situation there is a   solid amount of carne asada on the inside of this  and it is just beautiful across the board the   flavor is awesome you can tell it's grilled it's  marinated nicely it's very hearty very flavorful   but again just the right amount of saltiness and  creaminess of all the cheese on the inside so   really digging this let's go for a  couple more bites guys really tasty mmm you know i've had a few tortas in the past and  this is a little bit more of a different style i   mean naturally when i think of tortas i think of  more like a regular sandwich a little bit more of   a thicker type of bread but they actually do  have versions that are on sub like rolls like   this guys and i really like that combination  because it differentiates from a standard   torta but guys epic in name because it's packed  full of the goodness on the inside of this so   totally digging the quality it's very fresh and  definitely one of the best tortas i've had at   least the only torta i've ever had fast food wise  and especially coming from del taco again an idea   whose time is long overdue to be honest this  is really delicious and i can kind of see why   they're kind of changing their name right now to  del torta instead of del taco which is kind of   fun for marketing but guys again very very tasty  i got gotta keep showing it to you because this   is loaded with cheese i haven't had this much  cheese in a fast food item in a very long time   and i gotta say this is really beautiful  even with that pico actually look it is   all littered throughout just a lovely lovely  thing very tasty all right so let's go for   one more bite on this one then we'll wrap the  review up with the rating coming up next but   guys a really beautiful showcase and right  out of the gate this is super flavorful a   banging situation on this one over here at del  taco one more bite and we'll close it out hang on mmm all right you can't tell me this doesn't look  incredible right now guys all the queso blanco all   the grated cheddar cheese and all the meat going  in with this it's a very basic ingredients list   but guys it works extremely well and as you can  see no shortage of the carne asada action with this   one i am totally digging what i've got here right  now and it is just lovely lovely lovely right out   the gate with these epic tortas definitely a  banging option on the menu over here at del taco   new epic tortas bigg-er toasti-er epic-er man  you know i am so good after those three or four   bites of that so dense so rich i am pretty much  satisfied guys very very delicious okay overall   with everything you've seen and heard up to this  point and as if i have to confirm it for you   which i'm going to anyway i'm gonna have to give  the carne asada epic torta here at del taco the   obvious 10 out of 10 like i said guys right out  the gate it's fresh it's got so much on the inside   of that roll and i got to say the toastiness and  the softness at the same time dovetail beautifully   right into the creaminess of all the cheeses and  naturally with plenty of the carne asada in there   very nicely marinated just the right amount of  saltiness and overall guys even with that pico   de gallo in there you couldn't really taste it i  mean at least i couldn't with any of those bites   because of how rich the cheese was just super  delicious and super hearty that's all you really   need guys to satisfy for the day i think if you  can finish that pretty nice all right so do me   a quick favor if you've already given this one  a shot over here at del taco drop some comments   down
