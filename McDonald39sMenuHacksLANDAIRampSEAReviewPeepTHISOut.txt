 what's going on everyone welcome and welcome back  to the channel it's Ian K where today i'm over at   mcdonald's to check out the fourth and final  options off of their official menu hacks now   available for a limited time only and truth be  told i'm thinking this one can actually be the   official burger of our nation's armed forces so  stay tuned because the land air and sea is up next   welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty all right so let's see if i actually saved the  best for last with this one because if anything   this is definitely the tallest definitely the  heaviest out of all the menu hacks available   at mcdonald's right now so without further  ado you guys are looking at it right now   here we go the land air and sea burger and  guys again very tall very hefty it's got   all the proteins you can imagine on this one here  just about everything that they offer pretty much   and i gotta say the presentation of  this is a pretty big monstrosity let   me pull it back for you real fast as you  can see it's taking up the whole screen   all right so breaking this one down what we've  got is the classic big mac featuring two all beef   patties special sauce lettuce cheese pickles  onions on a sesame seed bun followed up with a   mcchicken along with it which features lettuce  mayo and of course the crispy chicken patty   and then naturally rounding it out we've got the  filet-o-fish that crispy fish fillet along with   tartar sauce and cheese once you put all of these  together you've got exactly that guys land air   and sea beef chicken and fish together all under  one roof so to speak and i gotta say the height   is pretty crazy on this it does look pretty  cool i have to admit for what you're getting here   and honestly i'm trying to keep this one in  frame because out of all the burgers that i've   tried over the years at various other fast food  restaurants none is really as tall as this because   of all the bread this has got this is pretty crazy  guys in my hands here right now how i'm gonna wrap   my mouth around this i don't know we're definitely  gonna go in and try right now you're gonna witness   it for the first time as i'm experiencing this  for the first time here on peep this out reviews   here we go it's the land air and sea burger here  at mickey d's an official menu hack let's do it oh well first off i got to be real with you like  i always am this is kind of ridiculous guys i   mean i got pretty much everything in one  bite this is going to be a huge mess here   as you're going to see a little bit of the chicken  a little bit of the beef a little bit of the fish   and all the stuff that goes along with it there  the predominant flavor that i'm getting with   this one believe it or not is the big mac sauce  it's really standing out along with all the other   proteins the crispy goodness the beefy goodness  not bad so far but very messy already yeah the   mac sauce is the problem with this one you've got  it in that middle layer as well as the bottom so   guys along with the tartar sauce and everything  else this has got everything is moving around   here so let's go for a few more bites on this  one but it is crazy messy and again just upside   down for you there take a look at that action  here let's give it a go again we're going in man the fish is getting away from me  in that last bite but guys i gotta say   this does not really work very well  combining all of these together it's   crazy messy there's no way to keep it  all together but as you're seeing here   it's all the gluttonous good stuff that  mickey d's has under one roof so to speak   and i gotta say it is fun to eat but a challenge  to eat at the same time especially here in the car   yeah this is definitely a mess i gotta keep this  one upside down for just a bit to help reorganize   all the layers on this one guys definitely  messy super fun to try and eat though i have   to tell you and out of all the other menu hacks  on the menu this is probably the most flavorful   because of everything that's in it naturally with  the other three that i did that you're probably   seeing jumping up on your screen here right now  this is a nice addition to finish off with and   i'm glad i kind of saved the quote-unquote best  for last because it's every flavor that you know   from mcdonald's under one roof and i'm gonna  keep saying that because that's what it feels   like everything under one roof for a really really  big house so let's go for another couple on this   real quick and as you can see again it is crazy  messy that mac sauce i had a feeling was gonna   be the wild card to give me a problem with this  one and it is let's go for another couple on this yeah this is definitely a one and done situation  for me here on the channel guys i'm absolutely   not gonna be doing this again i'm so glad to  officially do it on the channel for the review   naturally but guys this is a little too much for  me to be honest but at the same time i'm really   digging what i've got here flavor-wise it's decent  but aside from that i do have to say it was kind   of fun building this one and putting it together  and just seeing it kind of stack and become what   it eventually is right now in my hands a very  very huge gluttonous burger that has all the main   proteins from mcdonald's under one roof so pretty  tasty for that and the pickles naturally with the   big mac the sauce all those flavors they're  decent it's just crazy messy there's no way to   really do this easily make sure you've got plenty  of napkins you are absolutely going to need them   all right so let me go for one more bite in this  one before we round the review out with the rating   coming up next but guys i'm pretty good right now  in terms of my hunger level those few bites that i   took are pretty much it for me it's very thick  very gluttonous it's doing its job but again   i'm not going to be getting this again i'm just  glad to officially do it here on the channel   super fun to experience one more  bite we'll close it out hang on well the house is truly crumbling with this  one guys as i'm getting further and further   into it it's becoming pretty much nondescript  in the initial appearance department but you can   see all the proteins you can see everything there  it's got all the goodness the mac sauce is really   giving me problems even though it's flavorful but  what you've got here is a very very tasty one and   done for me at least and if you guys are down  with this now you've got it officially available   to you on the menu to build which you're probably  doing unofficially anyway they're just marketing   it pretty nicely though but still a lot of fun to  check out either way order the land air and sea by   name build it by hand and hack the mcdonald's  menu i'm surprised at how attracted i am to it   man i am so glad i've got this tray underneath  me right now guys please heed my warning if you   haven't gotten the point by now have plenty of  napkins on hand because you are absolutely going   to need them this thing is definitely a messy  situation but a gluttonously delicious one at   the same time so while i'm not going to be getting  this one ever again at least in the combo form the   way this one is designed it was super fun to  check out officially here on the channel and   still the fact that they're acknowledging this as  an official menu hack available to you even though   it doesn't have any promo pricing i mean guys $13.47  you're basically buying three different sandwiches   and they just want you to put it together it  would have been nice to have some promo stuff   to go along with it price-wise but it is what it  is still very gluttonous and still tasty so as   far as this one goes rating wise i'm gonna have to  give the unofficial burger of our country's armed   forces the land air and sea just an okay 7 out  of 10 guys the execution does look pretty cool   initially until you bite into it and that's when  everything just becomes a complete mess but still   the flavors are familiar you're going to recognize  everything in those bites and naturally with the   size it's very gluttonous it is pretty much  going to satisfy you i think once you get   to the halfway point unless you're crazy hungry  this is definitely overkill but still super fun   to check out either way all right so now that i've  completed the quadrilogy of reviews over here at   mickey d's when it comes to their menu hacks do me  a quick favor drop some comments down below which   was actually your favorite out of all four of them  and which do you actually get more often than not   drop those comments down below and definitely let  me know and with that this is Ian K closing out   another high quality foodie feature for you out  here on peep this out reviews bringing you brand   new content every single week here on my channel  so while you stay tuned for that next review coming   real soon in the meantime stay frosty yeah  while this one is definitely nothing special   to look at as you get further in guys the initial  presentation is pretty awesome and of course with   the culprit being that mac sauce everything  pretty much disintegrates as you get further   in but guys the flavor's still on point alright  everyone until next time i'll talk to you soon   hey thanks for checking out another one of my  reviews but just in case you didn't see the   one before this one you can find it right  up
