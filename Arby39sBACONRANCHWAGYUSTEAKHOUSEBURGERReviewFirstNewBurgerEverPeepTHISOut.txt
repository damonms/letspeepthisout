 what's going on everyone and welcome and  welcome back to the channel it's Ian K   where today i'm over at arby's once again  this time to check out the other brand new   burger they've got on the menu now available for  a limited time only that's right i still can't get   over it burgers at arby's so stay tuned because  the bacon ranch wagyu steakhouse burger is up next   welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty well i gotta say this is already winning  in the presentation department along with   filling out my hand pretty nicely guys feast  your eyes on this here we go with the bacon   ranch wagyu steakhouse burger here at arby's  lots of delicious ingredients to go in on   guys this is looking pretty amazing let's break  this one on down real fast yes sir definitely a   nice presentation on this one starting off with  that soft yet toasted buttery brioche bun let's   pop it and take a look underneath and it looks  like what we've got here is a decent amount of   parmesan peppercorn ranch along with shredded  lettuce and as we pan down we've got even more   of that parmesan peppercorn ranch and shredded  lettuce along with a couple of slices of tomato   and of course we've got that bacon action guys and  that's all on top of a slice of american cheese   that covers the main star of the show guys the  american wagyu ground beef patty comprised of 52%   weigu beef and 48% ground beef again another  lovely situation of thickness on this one it's   definitely looking pretty awesome and underneath  it looks like we've got even more of that parmesan   peppercorn ranch along with some pickles and some  red onion but guys coming back to the meat itself   6.4 ounces of goodness before cooking i gotta  say i am very excited to see the combination   of flavor with this one along with all the  other ingredients this is looking pretty nice   so there you go it's the all new bacon ranch wagyu  steakhouse burger here at arby's let's peep   out this flavor you know i gotta say again the  presentation of this is absolutely killer guys   and with the patty itself not being so much wide  as it is thick it really looks to satisfy and it's   going to be a very hearty bite to have a feeling  just a lovely situation but again i really wish   i had a little bit of a burger diaper actually  in the very back of this to hold everything in   if you guys haven't seen the first review  that i did on the deluxe version of this   take a look at that jumping up on your screen  here right now that could have benefited from   a burger diaper as well but i think i'm just gonna  tough it out let's just go for it guys here we go   it's the bacon ranch wagyu steakhouse  burger here at arby's let's peep this out mmm the thickness is crazy good you know the  flavor of that wagyu and ground beef combination   on this one guys goes so amazing together but i  gotta say it really dovetails into the parmesan   peppercorn ranch better than that special burger  sauce from the other one guys this is actually   a better burger believe it or not in my opinion  just overall a very hearty burger at the same time   and with the smokiness of that bacon thrown into  the mix this is a beautiful showpiece of all the   meats that they have over here at least in this  burger anyway for arby's very very delicious on   this for sure and i guess i'd expect nothing less  considering the cooking process which is basically   sous vide low temperature longer cooking naturally  to really seal in the juices all that good stuff   you can really taste the quality it's  definitely an upper scale type of burger   and i think they were going for that personally  guys because it really works amazingly well   with all the ingredients now with the parmesan  peppercorn ranch goodness of course they've had   that on the menu forever but it goes amazing with  the meat on this guys and it really is a showpiece   along with the smokiness of that bacon let's go  for another few on this guys this is really good yes sir a very solid choice going with wagyu  beef with this one guys the marbled goodness   that that actually offers a little bit more  fat in it gives you a lot more flavor to   go with everything else that you've got here  guys and when you combine that with the bacon   and everything else on this even though the cheese  is kind of there i'm not really tasting that   the quality of this one along with that parmesan  peppercorn ranch sauce is singing to me big time   it's a nice combination that really sets off  all the flavors in this one but speaking of   all the awesome flavor on this burger let's go for  a little bit of extra shall we and of course that   means adding a little bit of horsey sauce action  this is really gonna be something to try never   had it on a burger because then again i've never  had a burger here at arby's hang on one second yeah definitely gonna give this a shot all right  and yes i just spit that out in front of you guys   craziness here we go little shot of  that horsey action let's give this a go oh man wow where to begin first off that horseradish bite  definitely gets to your tongue before anything   else and then you start tasting all the other  flavors of the beef and the bacon everything   together it all blends and i gotta say guys  beautifulness all around and it goes amazing with   the wagyu and ground beef action over here horsey  is made from meat and it really works extremely   well horseradish sauce of any type i think we'll  be banging on this considering the quality of it   really delicious stuff in fact i really love  it so much so on this burger i'm gonna go for   another one before we wrap the review up with  the rating coming up next but guys let's go   let's just go for it this is too delicious not  to really really delicious creamy action man   this really is a highlight i'd love to see like  a horsey sauce type of burger specifically as   a special type of sauce without having to put  it on but even still i don't mind it because   it's truly a banging situation here one more bite  we'll close this one out guys hang on one second okay well let's just jump right to it because  i have a feeling you know what to expect   when it comes to a rating on this one overall  i'm gonna have to give the bacon ranch way good   steakhouse burger here at arby's the obvious 10  out of 10 guys that was a beautiful situation   and believe it or not the parmesan peppercorn  ranch is a better compliment compared to the   special burger sauce in my opinion the combination  goes amazing with that meat and once you add the   smokiness to the bacon into the mix the crunch  of the pickles everything else that one has got   a very lovely situation of course the cheese  is still a little non-existent but overall it's   keeping everything together but the flavor is  drop dead amazing on that especially when you   add horsey sauce into the mix easily worth your  time you should definitely go with this one which   of course is now gonna segue into this question  i'm gonna ask you do me a quick favor drop those   comments down
