tuned because the queso burger is up next welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty so here we go with your queso burger over here at Sonic and there's definitely cheesy goodness falling out of this one guys take a look at that that is looking really really nice and I have to admit the size of this is looking pretty good already let's lift the bun up on this one here lots of goo whoa lots of gooey goodness guys take a look at this a mixture of cheddar and a cheese sauce together we've got some grilled onions we have some hatch chilies and some zesty Baja sauce in here and I got to admit guys this is looking really good the grilled onions are all throughout this right now and this is actually on top of what looks like a quarter pound patty of beef here 100% goodness and it's looking fairly thick let me take a look at the very bottom here I have a feeling there's gonna be nothing there you go was hoping there'd be some more cheese there but man guys the hatch chilies the baja sauce you have those onions you have a little bit of the mayo this is looking really really tasty let's see if the flavors gonna deliver on this one cuz the aroma is awesome it's the all-new queso burger here at Sonic let's peep out this flavor yeah I'm definitely a cheese lover so virtually any burger that's got queso in the title is instantly gonna grab my attention so naturally when I saw queso burger over at Sonic guys they're just cutting to the chase and telling you what it is it's a cheese burger but obviously it's got more to it and more to it it definitely does because aside from all of that cheesy goodness as we go in for one more quick close-up here you've got plenty of grilled onions and I'm diggin the amount of the goodness this one it's got here guys it looks and smells pretty fantastic alright before I take the first bite and like always if you guys are fans of high-quality delicious looking food reviews make sure to hit that subscribe button down below and

right away the cheese sauce and those hatch chilies are coming through that's a nice flavor it's very robust along with being just a little heated so let me bring this one in closer again for you as you can see I'm gonna squeeze that right down there and lovely situation as that cheese is oozing those hot chilies add just a little bit of spice it's nothing crazy at all but it's definitely different than jalapeno loving that flavor it's almost like an Ortega salsa type of situation that type of heat kind of like that type of thing it's kind of the best way I can describe it because I'm getting a vibe like that like I really need some chips to go with this right now and granted it is queso of course but guys thankfully the beef patty is fairly juicy this time out and everything else is swinging on this one not really tasting the light mayo and that's actually okay but those grilled onions along with the cheese major highlight guys and it's a rich type of cheddar too let's go for another bite mmm that's good man those hatch chilies are amazing I don't really have hatch chilies very often so I am digging the flavor of the cheese along with it guys and I got to say the only way that I can think to improve upon this is maybe making it a double because it really needs a little bit of extra meat and as you guys can see around the side here again no shortage of the cheesy goodness here guys this is really really nice and those grilled onions again really swing with the hatch chilies and the cheese it's a nice combination and worthy of the queso name so delicious stuff let's go for a couple more bites of this one here but as you can tell I'm digging it I'm usually on the fence with Sonic here and there this is actually really good let's keep going yeah the further I get into this the more I'm wishing there was a second patty on this because this will be perfect as a double so let's go for another quick close up here I'm gonna go for another bite of this one but as you can see the hatch chile combination with a zesty cheddar goodness is amazing the Baja sauce is probably adding a little bit of extra heat to this one but those hatch chilies are very noticeable in flavor so I am digging that along with the grilled onions guys a delicious situation let's go for one more bite and of course we'll give you another quick close up here how could you not want to see all that cheesy goodness right I'm gonna go for that bite right there in the middle to finish this one out let's do it hmm queso alright so here we go with a perfect cross-section shot and I'm gonna squeeze down the very top here and as you can see the oozy ooey gooey goodness that is coming out over here right now it is oozing I should say really really sets this one off there is a decent amount of cheese as you can see and I really digging the overall combination but like I said please please please this has got to be done as a double I guess you can order a second patty and I think if I do that the next time around it's worth it order ahead in the sonic app definitely tasty stuff and now that I've made it to the halfway point of that burger I'm probably thinking maybe there could have been just a little bit of seasoning on the beef patty itself but other than that guys it's very flavorful it is 100% beef but still very juicy so light seasoning aside it really works very well with all those toppings on there and like I said with the hatch chilies the cheddar cheese and all that just the overall goodness that it gives you I'm really digging it with those grilled onions that was a major highlight for me beautiful combination and worthy of the queso name so with that said I'm gonna have to give the queso burger here at sonic America's drive-in a pretty rock-solid 8.5 out of 10 the only thing this one really needs in my opinion is really just a little bit of seasoning on that beef because all the other toppings are amazing and possibly making it a double that would really be a beautiful situation but guys a delicious cheese burger worthy of the queso name and like I said to hatch chilies alone really worth it just for the flavor of those in addition to the Baja sauce it was a nice combination of everything together and you can taste everything that's the important thing all right now the all-important question are you personally gonna be swinging over to Sonic to give this one a shot drop some comments down below how did this burger look to you right now and in addition to that have you ever had hatch chiles especially on a burger drop those comments
