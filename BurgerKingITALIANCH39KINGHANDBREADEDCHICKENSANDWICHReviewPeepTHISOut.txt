 what's going on everyone and welcome back to  another high quality foodie feature for you here   on the channel where this time i'm back on over  at bk to go in on a variation of their all-new   hand breaded chicken that i've always wanted to try  and now that the italian original chicken sandwich   is here now's the perfect time to go in that's  right you already know so stay tuned because the   hand breaded italian ch'king is up next welcome  to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty so here we go with the hand breaded italian  ch'king here at bk and already the presentation   is very inviting on this one guys aside from  that nice brioche style potato bun the chicken   in the middle is looking pretty awesome with that  mozzarella cheese and the marinara sauce peeking   out all right so let's pop the top of said brioche  style potato bun and take a look underneath and   it looks like we have a decent portion of that  marinara sauce and underneath it guys take a   look at that there mozzarella cheese and of course  their hand breaded white meat chicken breast very   popeye's-esque if i could say so and i gotta say it  is fried up very nicely nice golden crispy brown   on this one and it looks really really awesome  underneath it and keeping everything together   is some more mozzarella cheese and on the very  bottom more of that marinara sauce but guys the   presentation although it's very simple on this one  is looking super inviting like i said definitely   nice quality and it's definitely got some height  to it as well i can't wait to get into this one   so there you go it's the hand breaded italian  ch'king sandwich here at bk let's peep out this   flavor yes sir just like i said very popeye's  esque with this one guys take a look at that   chicken right there i gotta say it looks very  similar to popeyes and honestly it really is   a doppelganger if you ask me aside from the  mozzarella cheese and the marinara sauce sticking   out there you'd be hard-pressed to tell me this  wasn't a popeye's chicken sandwich it definitely   looks awesome and of course it's got the height  it's got the girth as well can't wait to get   into this so here we go we're doing just that it's  the all-new hand-breaded italian ch'king sandwich   here one more time for you guys here at bk i'm  so glad i'm doing this right now let's do it yes yes all right right off the break i always  said since day one with these brand new hand   breaded chicken sandwiches here at bk that i  wanted to try a chicken parm version because even   though i reviewed a chicken parm variant way back  in the day when they upgraded their chicken then   which was still pretty tasty you can't fade the fact  that having it on hand breaded chicken is going to   be even better and guys it is absolutely better  i can't imagine this being that much different   when this comes out officially because you know  it's coming but as you can see the loveliness i   got in front of me here right now is showcasing  very nicely the chicken is awesome and i have to   say again very lovely on that marinara sauce  situation along with the mozzarella cheese   and again the quality of that chicken like  i said is absolutely tasty on this guys i   mean fried chicken of course i'm really getting  that chicken parm vibe with this one strictly   because of the marinara sauce and the fried  goodness on the outside but the thickness   of the chicken overall again i'm just going  to keep showing this to you as much as i can   is really taking this one up to new levels  right now i had a feeling this was going   to be pretty tasty and i am so glad to  be doing this again let's keep going in well I definitely took a nice big solid bite out  of that one there for the second time and as you   can see the mozzarella cheese is sandwiching  together everything nicely guys i have to say   the sauce on the top on the bottom is held  in beautifully with that mozzarella cheese   admittedly it's a little on the mild  side in that flavor but the creaminess   is definitely adding to this one and again  it is holding its own along with that nice   soft brioche style potato bun this is  definitely an awesome chicken sandwich   all right so not taking too much away from the  italian original chicken sandwich which i reviewed   recently you guys can take a look at that review  popping up on your screen here right now this is   actually the preferred way to actually experience  i think something like a chicken parm style so   again i'm gonna keep showing it to you the chicken  makes the difference with this one aside from the   original chicken sandwich being kind of like a  big nugget you're getting a nice juicy chicken   breast with this one and of course the quality of  that mozzarella cheese and the marinara sauce it   being the same is definitely taking this one up  and it really does enhance what's already a very   tasty chicken sandwich over here at bk banging  stuff guys let's go for a couple more quick bites you know what i'm really digging the most about  this sandwich aside from the flavor of marinara   sauce and the mozzarella cheese is just the  overall breading to meat ratio i mean naturally   you're going to have a very thick amount of  chicken right here and a very light coating   believe it or not of the actual breading itself  so it's not overly crazy but again it makes a   difference with this one like i said with those  simple ingredients to really take this one up a   notch guys again very delicious stuff and totally  worth getting in this variation i'm telling you   this really is the way to experience it all  right so let's go for one more bite in this   one before we wrap the video up next here guys  but again for the 5 millionth time i'm super   glad to check this one out and it was well worth  the wait to go for a chicken parm variant of these   hand breaded chicken sandwiches over here at bk  you know this one's coming officially and i can't   imagine it being that much different than this  right now delicious stuff one more bite hang on all right so let's do a little 360 around the  world action for this one and as you can see guys   lovely presentation all around a very decent  amount of chicken he really is on point with the   flavor overall and as you can see the quality of  the ch'king speaks for itself over here at bk pair   it up with some really tasty marinara sauce and  mozzarella cheese and of course a potato bun and   you've got something you definitely want to check  out easily worth the time easily all right so   being that i put this one together right now i'm  not going to give this a rating but if i was going   to give it a rating of course it's going to be way  up there that's easily one of the best versions   of the hand breaded chicken sandwich over here at bk  and when they do come out with an official variant   which i have no doubt they will at some point in  the near future you can bet i'm gonna be getting   it again it is definitely delicious stuff all  right so one simple question drop some comments   down below what did you personally think of this
