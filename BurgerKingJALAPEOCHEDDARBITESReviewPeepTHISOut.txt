 hey everyone I'm back at it this time over a good old BK to take a look at their latest side item so stay tuned because the jalapeno cheddar bites are up next welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty so we're going in on a box that should be full of flavor flavor flavor it's the jalapeno cheddar bites here at BK and these actually kind of look like little jalapenos covered in breading all on their own guys that's looking kind of cool actually nice and crispy nice and golden let's lift one of these up here and see almost like a little triangle of cheese actually this is really really nice but as you can see the breading feels kind of light on this but it does feel kind of hefty though these are kind of heavy so looking nice here we've got an 8 piece order of these and for dipping some ranch to go with so that's gonna be awesome right away because I love the ranch here at BK but guys there you go let's see if this one delivers on that flavor promise it's the jalapeno cheddar bites here at BK let's peep out this flavor oh and just so you know you can also get this in a four piece as well but being that I'm a huge fan of cheese and anything fried anyway I have a feeling this is gonna be pretty tasty so let's just say I'm pretty glad I've got an extra four piece to go with alright so like always before we get started if you guys are fans of high quality

digging the little size of these little nuggz here they look really really cool look at that nice and crispy pretty much like a little block of cheese like a little triangle but more jalapeno goodness obviously thrown into the mix with this let's give this a shot right now it's the brand-new jalapeno cheddar bites here at BK that cheddar is thick and I have nothing to drink right now Wow guys look at this on the inside that is a nice cheesy squirt right there let me get that focus in the focus is crazy lately here but as you can see this looks really really good little bits of jalapeno not so much heat but a nice pickle type of pepper flavor that's actually really tasty mmm I'm glad I've got the extra four piece right now believe me I'm very happy these are tasty very nice and again the coating on this is very light it actually sets it off very nicely here the crispiness that it's adding overall and that rich cheddar flavor is coming through beautifully on this year let's go for one more of these and then we're definitely going for a different some ranch mmm that is cheesy I am loving that I'm gonna keep showing this as much as I can to you here look at that really nice a decent amount of jalapeno as well nice size I would recommend getting the 8 because they are a little on the smaller side but they're packed you're a little hefty this is a lovely situation mmm all right so the moment I am definitely looking forward to considering how well this is going already you've got to have ranch with some fried goodness here guys I definitely love the ranch here at BK lovely situation in terms of just the overall thickness that you're gonna see here but guys look at this look how thick this is it stands up on the inside here look at that that is just nuts let's give this a shot with that ranch I know this is gonna be bomb hmm and it is the light tang the creaminess of that ranch the thick density that I'm getting from the cheddar and those jalapeno pieces mmm man these are really good I'm kind of getting a Mac and Cheetos vibe actually from this but it really is nice because there's no noodle on the inside but a lot more full rich cheddar flavor which is bomb I am really loving this combination this is lovely Wow hmm all right so let me just kill this 4 piece cuz that's all I'm gonna have this for right now because I really want to save these for a little bit later on but guys as you can see nice crispy situation on this we're gonna go for one more dip very very nice the thick ranch this is the perfect pairing with this I see why it's gonna come standard nice combination overall and definitely something I would recommend giving a shot if you love cheese and the slightest and you like cheddar especially lots of rich cheddar flavor on this with a little bit of that jalapeno on the backend just a lovely situation definitely bomb mmm one more last shot look at that cheesy goodness on the inside of this guy's that is just awesome and a very solid amount of jalapenos as well very even mix and definitely a lovely situation highly recommended on this bangin guys there's really no other way to sum this one up that is a bangingly deliciously cheesy snack right there and I have to admit it delivers across the board the cheesiness is there the jalapeno flavor is there the heat not so much but honestly they're not going for that with this you're getting the nice jalapeno flavor overall but that cheese is amazing and the coating is just thin enough but when you bite into it it feels like you're getting a lot of it don't let the size of those fool you they are a little on the small side but they're packed and they're dense easy recommendation so as if you really need me to attach a number to this rating right now cuz you already know what its gonna be I'm gonna have to give the jalapeno cheddar bites here at BK a rock solid 10 out of 10 skip the 4 piece go right to the 8 piece I guarantee you you're gonna pretty much inhale the 4 like I just did you're gonna be glad you're gonna have that extra 4 spot on the back up that is really great now the obvious question at least to me anyway is do you personally think they're great drop some comments down below have you had these already and if you haven't are you super excited to give these a shot drop those comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is
