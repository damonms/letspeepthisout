 hey everyone and welcome back to another  high quality foodie feature for you here   on the channel where this time i've  returned to sonic to see if they can   redeem themselves after my last couple  of less than stellar experiences here by   going in on their latest burger promo  which admittedly looks pretty decent   so let's see if this one's gonna be any good this  is the supersonic crave double cheeseburger and   already guys this is looking pretty decent in the  meat department considering the double patties   that are on here but overall the presentation is  not too bad let's pop the top on this bun and take   a look underneath so starting us off we've got a  healthy portion of their all-new crave sauce mixed   in with a little bit of diced onions some lettuce  and some pickles and as we pan down it looks like   we've got two tomato slices as well this looks  a little thrown together but it's all good   and that's all on top of two 100% pure beef patties  guys and again separated with a couple of slices   of cheese not too bad semi-fresh looking let me  see if i can split the meat here in the middle and   see if we can get some cheese pull it's admittedly  a little light in that department but overall we   do have the cheese we do have the beef and plenty  of all the other condiments on this one with that   crave sauce being the main highlight so let's  not waste any more time on this one this is the   all new supersonic crave double cheeseburger  here at sonic america's drive-in let's peep   out this flavor yeah this definitely looked a  little thrown together when i popped the top on   this one so i kind of reoriented the pickles and  the tomatoes just a bit but as you can see guys   not bad in terms of the thickness department when  it comes to the meat on this one and again with   the two slices of cheese i see why they're calling  this the supersonic burger it's basically the big   gun double cheeseburger they have on the menu with  that crave sauce thrown into the mix so let's get   into it guys it's the all new supersonic crave  double cheeseburger here at sonic let's do it meaty but you knew that right well right  off the break that crave sauce is a major   highlight as it should be considering it's  in the title to this one but honestly guys   it's kind of reminding me of a little bit more  of a kicked up thousand island dressing maybe   just a little bit more sweeter in general but  overall it's mixing nicely with the beef and   everything else on here let's go for another bite  on this one we'll give you a close-up but so far   it's a better experience but this doesn't  feel too much different than a standard   regular double cheeseburger with some thousand  island dressing so far let's keep going in you know i almost feel that this one can benefit  from a burger diaper in the back because that   sauce is leaking big time there is a lot of  the crave sauce on this guys but even still   it's dovetailing nicely with everything that  you're seeing here that pure beef is pretty solid   it's not the freshest beef i've had over here  at sonic but it's definitely not bad either   and overall it's mixing very nicely with  the crunchiness of the pickles the lettuce   a little bit of the tomato action as well but  overall a very tasty double cheeseburger so far   with some kicked up thousand island in  my opinion you know truth be told i was   originally going back to sonic to try the single  variant of this but when i got there they were   promoting this one all around the location like  the double variant is the version to get with   this naturally so i was kind of curious to  give it a try since it's been a minute since   i've had a double cheeseburger from sonic but  even still the extra beef patty does make a   difference because it makes it larger naturally  but overall it's a lot of beefy flavor but like   i said a little bit of a kicked up thousand  island dressing that crave sauce is okay   but it's not blowing my socks off but even still  not a bad experience so far let's keep going in you know the further i'm getting into this  the more i'm wishing the beef itself was just   a little bit on the juicier side because that  crave sauce is kind of picking up the slack for   that personally and you know now that i think  about it i think the main difference between   the regular supersonic double cheeseburger here  at sonic and this crave variant is pretty much   just the sauce i think that other one uses just  straight mayo or just the usual condiments as   well but even still guys like i said it's  great to have an extra option on the menu   with crave sauce naturally with the  extra patty that this has got as well   and overall it's not a bad double cheeseburger  i just wish it was just a little bit juicier now   that i'm getting further in but even still pretty  tasty guys pretty tasty so let's go for one more   bottom this one before we close it up after  the rating coming up but let me just say guys   definitely a better experience compared to the  last couple of times that i've been here to sonic   and honestly you can only go up from that point  right one more bite and then we'll close it up so let's kind of go around the world quickly with  this one guys it's very messy but at the same   time that sauce is a major highlight again it's  a kicked up type of thousand island dressing   that goes amazingly well with the beef over here  again i just wish it was a little bit juicier to   really bring out the flavor even more but overall  with what this one has got with the cheese with   all the crunchy goodness definitely digging the  onions the pickles and of course the lettuce just   a nice combination guys a nice combination all  around one sonic crave cheeseburger so with that said i'm gonna   have to give the new supersonic crave double  cheeseburger here at sonic america's drive-in   just an okay 7 out of 10 and i think you  can probably catch the vibe all throughout this   review it's not blowing my socks off but it's a  better experience and i gotta say considering a   double cheeseburger over here at sonic being as  good as this is right now i'm happy what i got   with semi-fresh although like i said i was really  hoping the beef was gonna be a little bit fresher   it's still delivered flavor-wise and there's  something to definitely be said about that   crave sauce because like i said that's the main  highlight of it really on top of everything else   on that burger it's got a little bit of elevated  sweetness but overall the combination works with   everything on that burger so overall not a bad  experience this time especially with this one   all right so aside from asking you if you're going  to be giving this one a shot do me a quick favor   drop some comments down below let me know which  variant of this you're going to be giving a go   on is it going to be the single or the double  and if you've had both which did you actually   like the best drop those comments down below and  definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K   closing out another high quality foodie feature  for you out here on peep this out reviews bringing   you brand new content every single week here on  my channel so while you stay tuned for that next review   coming real
