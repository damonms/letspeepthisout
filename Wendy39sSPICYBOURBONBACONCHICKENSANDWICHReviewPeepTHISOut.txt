 hey everyone welcome back to another high quality  foodie feature for you here on the channel   cheaters cam style after hours over at wendy's  this time to go in in a different variation of   their all-new bourbon bacon because honestly  it just had to be done to satisfy my curiosity   so buckle up because we're about to get into the  spicy bourbon bacon chicken sandwich and already   guys i am digging the presentation of this one  that chicken fillet is looking pretty awesome on   the inside of this one here and of course what's  setting it off is the pretzel bun that it's on   and honestly guys i had to go with the pretzel  bun because how could you not these are awesome   so let's pop it and take a look under the hood  and as you're gonna find we've got plenty of   that bourbon bacon sauce here along with that  applewood smoked bacon action guys i love how   it's glistening in the light here right now  there is a decent amount of both of them and   i'm digging that this also has got some crispy  onions of course plenty more of that applewood   smoked bacon action as you can see there as  well and an american cheese slice all on top   of a spicy crispy chicken fillet and honestly with  the chicken game being huge over here at wendy's   how could we not try it with chicken right this  is looking pretty great so it looks like on the   bottom there's nothing there but that's perfectly  fine because it is definitely front loaded on the   top with the good stuff guys let's see if this  one's going to deliver with the flavor this is   the all new spicy bourbon bacon chicken sandwich  here at wendy's let's peep out this flavor   yeah i already knew when i was filming that  bourbon bacon double cheeseburger last week   that i was gonna be back to give this one a shot  with chicken because how could you not right all   of these toppings look amazing with the chicken  already guys and i have to admit with that pretzel   bun on the very top here that is definitely gonna  be the capper to really kind of capitalize on the   flavor with this one plus it feels awesome in  the hand on top of it so let's not waste any   more time on this one guys it's the spicy bourbon  bacon chicken sandwich here at wendy's let's do it mmm you know i got to say when i was putting this  one together in my head before coming to do   this review i was really looking forward to  the fact that the bourbon bacon sauce given   the sweetness that it's got was hopefully  going to be elevated because of the heat   from the chicken and guys it is completely  this is a beautiful combination of sweet   and heat together and i gotta say the smokiness  of the bacon on top of it and the crispy onions   on that it is just a delicious situation here guys  take a look at that chicken patty on the bottom   different protein of choice instead  of the burger here but even still   the combination of the chicken and that barbecue  sauce this really feels like a southwestern   summertime barbecue burger actually but with  chicken and i gotta say guys it is really tasty   let's keep going in guys my satisfaction  is definitely up there already here we go chicken is thick too all right here's a better  cross-section shot with that second bite taken   out and i gotta say guys it is a bourbon bacon  showcase with a little bit of heat with this   one here the bacon is awesome with this one in  general i'm not tasting anything really in the   sauce itself as opposed to all the applewood  smoked bacon which i actually have more of   compared to what i had the first time around with  the bourbon bacon double cheeseburger but guys a   lovely situation the crispiness of the chicken on  the bottom over there a lovely situation on top of   that and the heat to go with it guys really tasty  yeah there was just no way this could have failed   because obviously it's got the western theme going  and when you think of crispy chicken and barbecue   sauce instantly you're winning right there already  on top of the bacon with this as well guys and   again that bourbon bacon sauce is really lighting  this one up the sweetness is a little bit up there   but the heat that i'm getting thanks to the  chicken is elevating the overall flavor profile   and it's kind of balancing it believe it or not  i don't really mind it so much but the heat is   really adding and of course the pretzel bun  action guys soft catcher's mitt goodness and   i gotta say the freshness is banging they really  do what pretty amazing over here at wendy's and   i'm so glad i was able to customize essentially  the pretzel bacon pub chicken sandwich over here   you're basically swapping out the ingredients for  what's exactly on the current offering right now   which is the bourbon bacon cheeseburger and there  you go swapping the protein you're good to go here   and it's roughly the same price maybe just a  little bit more but even still guys a beautiful   combination all around here let's go for a  couple more bites and i gotta say guys again   i'm glad i'm doing this especially late night  this is super delicious let's keep going in crispy bacon you know when it comes to fast food  wendy's clearly knows what they're doing when it   comes to bacon the quality of the applewood bacon  is always banging over here they have a reputation   for a reason of having high quality bacon on  their fast food burgers and i gotta say guys   it is definitely not tasting like fast food  it really kind of tastes more like a diner   type of bacon i mean it's really pretty high  quality and the crispiness 9 times out of 10   mostly 9 times plus out of 10 is always on point  and it really elevates what it's put on when you   combine that with this all new bourbon bacon sauce  even though like i said i'm not really tasting   bacon in the sauce itself the apple would smoked  bacon is easily making up for the fact that it's   adding that flavor on top of the sweetness and  then when you add the cheese which admittedly is   a little non-existent on here considering all the  other strong flavors it's understandable but when   you combine everything together with the chicken  and of course the pretzel bun guys it's an easy   recommendation to give it a shot because all the  current ingredients right now on the wendy's menu   can give you what i'm having here right now so  definitely give it a go and like i said again   the quality of the bacon here on top of  the chicken the spiciness the sweetness   and of course the pretzel bun i'm so glad again  i got this pretzel bun it is so delicious with it   it's an easy way to go guys easy take  one more bite on this one we'll close   it up after the rating but guys again do  it you know you want to you're watching   the review this far in you need to  go give this one a shot let's go now i'm sure this would be just as tasty with  their premium bun that comes with the standard   bourbon bacon cheeseburger on its own but guys if  you have the pretzel bun option available and you   should that's the one you want to go with here  because it really does add the overall textural   and the chewiness on top of it which i'm really  digging but when you combine that with everything   else on here as you heard me say crazily all  throughout this video i gotta say guys this   is really the way to go with this the bacon is  awesome the chicken is awesome with it and even   though you can't really taste the cheese with  all the crispy onions and all the nice flavors   otherwise it really is a very satisfying crispy  chicken sandwich right now especially with a lot   of bacon flavor great stuff well as you can see  this definitely wasn't about just swapping out   the protein with all the same ingredients on the  original bourbon bacon cheeseburger and calling   it a day i switched it over to the pretzel bun  and that makes a huge difference because all   those flavors combining with the flavor of that  and just the overall feel of it elevates it to a   whole new level and obviously you guys already  know the chicken game at wendy's is on point   everything about that was super delicious with  the exception of the cheese which is still just   okay but even still guys the quality was pretty  high so i'm going to assume the cheese wasn't   even there because it really wasn't a factor  whatsoever considering all the other flavor   and with that said i'm gonna have to give the  spicy bourbon bacon chicken sandwich a rock   solid 10 out of 10 because like i said for all  the reasons that you heard up to this point the   quality of everything on that was completely  singing right now guys it was freshly made   and everything was just super flavorful  the bacon was definitely high on that   and everything about that aside from just  the sauce itself being a little bit sweet   even still like i said the combination of the  bacon really kind of helped to even that out   the quality of that chicken the crispiness on the  outside and more importantly the spiciness that it   added was really really a lovely situation just  solid stuff all around all right so now the only   question that i'm gonna ask you is based upon this  build of the sandwich that i just reviewed for you   right now what did you personally think of it  drop some comments down below and definitely   let me know and with that this is Ian K closing  out another high quality foodie feature for you   here on peep this out reviews cheaters cam style  after hours bringing you brand new
