 well it looks like the latest from Sonic is taking  their fast food famous tots and kicking them up   a bit with a little bit of barbecue flare and I  gotta say guys presentation wise it looks pretty   tasty in addition to smelling pretty interesting  as well more on that in just a bit so stay tuned   because I've got their all-new barbecue chip  seasoned tots here on the channel I'm Ian K and   you're about to peep this out welcome to peep  this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty   yes sir when I say interesting I definitely  mean it in addition to being a little familiar   guys because I'm getting shades of barbecue  flavored Lays chips with this it's a pretty   strong pungent type of Aroma and it reminds me  of that instantly but it looks pretty nice and   the crispiness sure appears on point with  these so basically what you're looking at   is a nice portion of their classic tots that  are covered in what's described as a sweet and   savory barbecue chip flavored seasoning and  it's a wet type of sauce and it seems to be   drenched pretty nicely all throughout here guys a  very nice combination of sauce and crispy potato   goodness how bad could this really be right well  given that it's Sonic and their stuff tends to   be a little hit or miss with me every time I  review it at least how bad could this really   be unless this is just not made properly right  I mean it's a sauce on top of tots so let's get   one of them going here we'll get into this and  see exactly how this is gonna be it's small very   simple ingredients list it's the all-new barbecue  chip seasoned tots here at Sonic let's peep this out mmm very sweet   a little bit of Tang and then the barbecue sauce  comes out crispy Tot action that's not bad   a little decadent there saltiness is on point but  naturally they are coated very nicely guys very   hard to mess this one up thankfully it appears to  be made pretty nicely as well let's keep going it they are good for fast food tots not bad but again  I'm getting that Lays barbecue chip Vibe with   this one here so I like that because I like Lay's  barbecue chips and actually the sauce works very   nicely here it seems to be soaked up beautifully  and all the nooks and crannies of these tots and   there's a very nice amount of it all throughout so  for $3.89 a little bit pricey maybe for this but it   is what it is but it's not overly outrageous  still pretty tasty let's keep going in   not bad you know these are being marketed as a  nice little side item for whatever you get   over here at Sonic but just on its own it is  pretty tasty guys not bad in that department   but let me see how it is with some Sonic ranch  sauce because I had to get some ranch with this   I mean guys it's one of my all-time favorites  if not the all-time favorite sauce that I like   to get with chicken with anything really so  with potato tots why not let's give this a shot   and see how this is you can get any sauce  on the side with this but naturally Ranch is   my old standby I had to give this one a shot  with that let's give it a go with the ranch   mmm creamy Tangy tart very very nice let's go for  a couple more that barbecue flavor is nice with the   ranch guys the crispiness of the tots too nice and  potatoey on the inside very crispy and the sauce   a little bit of a light spice that I'm kind  of getting in the back of my throat with it   but it could be more of the salt if anything  but guys very tasty let's go for a couple more it's good so yeah guys I'm very glad that this is  made correctly and there is plenty of that sauce   action to go with I was kind of expecting this  to be more of a drier type of rub but I like the   fact that it's actually kind of like a gravy the  sauce is kind of thick and I really like that so   pairing it up with your sauce of choice you got  a lot of stuff to look forward to with this one   very very tasty again average pricing here in  Southern Cali $3.89 still pretty good let's go   for one more bite we'll wrap the review with the  rating coming up next hang on so yeah   guys not too much else to say with this one you're  going to get probably that Lay's barbecue chip   Vibe like I did with this one especially if you've  had them recently and I have to say that's a nice   combination with these crispy tots so the portion  size is fairly decent almost feels like the tray   that you would get with any of the specialty  fries at Wendy's and I have to say it's filled   up pretty nicely along with a decent amount of the  sauce definitely worth checking out at least once so with that said I'm gonna have to give  the all-new barbecue chip seasoned tots here   at Sonic a pretty decent 7.5 out  of 10 I'm not gonna go much higher than that   because guys at its core it's a basic Tot over  here at Sonic with a pretty nice sauce on the   top and I'm glad that it's a thicker type  of sauce because you're guaranteed to get a   really nice amount of that barbecue flavor and  the combination like I said does remind me of   Lay's barbecue chips and I think that's what they  were probably going for with that the familiarity   is definitely there pairing it up with your  sauce of choice you've got a lot of options   over here at Sonic Ranch is definitely Primo  but you'd expect that I'm a little bit biased   that way still something worth checking out at  least one time to give a go on it's pretty tasty   all right so do me a quick favor like always drop  those comments down below let me know what you   thought of the look of these barbecue chip seasoned  tots here at Sonic they look pretty appetizing to   you and if you've had them already which sauce  did you pair it up with was it pretty tasty with   what you got drop
