 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty here we go with another high quality foodie feature for you with Ian K here on peep this out reviews this time over at domino's because it looks like they've got two brand new specialty pizzas ready to go and one of them looks like it's going south of the border actually guys feast your eyes on their all-new chicken taco pizza and i gotta say this is definitely looking pretty colorful featuring premium chicken we've got american cheese cheddar cheese shredded provolone cheese three different types of cheeses obviously diced tomato onions and green peppers and i gotta say it looks really really good nice and colorful for the crust i decided to go with a hand tossed crust they're standard crust here it's a ten inch small pie and i gotta say it looks really really tasty so let's see if the flavor is going to deliver on this one it's their all-new chicken taco pizza here at domino's let's peep out this flavor yeah so it looks like they classify a small pie as 10 inches but honestly this feels a little bit bigger than a personal pizza actually i mean it looks good it's colorful but honestly just a little bit below the medium in terms of the size here and the box is a little on the mini size as well but it looks pretty good either way all right so like always before we get into this one if you guys are fans of high

guys the chicken taco pizza let me pull up a piece here for you give you another quick showing of it as you can see it's definitely colorful definitely it's got most of the ingredients of what a chicken taco should have but i think it's missing one key component hopefully the flavor is going to deliver either way and we'll talk about that as we get in further but here we go the chicken taco pizza here at domino's it's definitely cheesy and definitely flavorful but i'm not really getting a chicken taco vibe i mean don't get me wrong the flavor is absolutely there but i'm getting some nice creaminess from the cheddar cheese the provolone and then naturally everything else on this the chicken is pretty good it's definitely premium you can really taste it it's fairly juicy but i gotta admit i'm not really getting anything above and beyond a chicken pizza now i think what this really kind of needs and you're probably gonna go there with me with this right now is taco seasoning a little bit of a sprinkle of that on top of that would have gone a long way because guys i think it needs it honestly i'm not really getting anything above and beyond really nice creamy cheese with some chicken and a little bit of seasoning but it's mostly coming from the garlicky goodness that it's actually sprinkled with here it feels like but honestly very very tasty either way let's keep going the tomatoes the onions and the peppers are really adding something to this one here but as i'm getting further in there the flavor is elevated i'm not really getting anything above and beyond like the garlicky goodness that i'm used to over here but with that cheese and with everything else this has got it's a really nice evolutionary step up from a regular chicken pizza but it's not really feeling like a taco to me that's the only thing i'm definitely getting some nice saltiness to go with everything here but naturally salt equals flavor anyway but i gotta say the ingredients are very fresh and that three cheese blend this one has got on top of the chicken and of course the onions the peppers nice situation so far let me go for the crust real quick to see if there's maybe anything going on in the back here hmm well i'm definitely getting that classic hand tossed flavor of the crust over here at domino's for sure but again the ingredients on the front of this one here like i said although very fresh very cheesy very creamy and along with the chicken there's nothing really pronounced really to tell me that this is like a chicken taco like it's trying to emulate that naturally so i think a little bit more of spicing i think is really what's needed with this to kind of take that up some taco seasoning to sprinkle on maybe some ortega seasoning even that would really kick this one up but guys it's still fresh still very delicious let's go for one more bite you know for some reason getting to the very end of the slice now maybe there actually is something on this chicken believe it or not i mean it really feels like it is marinated somewhat like it's got something but it's not so much pronounced with taco seasoning that's the only thing but the flavor is really really nice a little bit of the garlic goodness a little bit of the salty goodness from the crust and of course it's nice and toasty on the bottom but again colorful it's got all the things you'd expect to have on a chicken taco naturally but it's just the taco flavor itself is a little on the light side for me but honestly everything else like i said is very very fresh and again very creamy with that cheese not bad on this one though really isn't i don't know if that one's supposed to have taco seasoning on it i'm not really getting it but naturally the chicken itself does feel like it's got a little something extra but nothing is really jumping out that this is definitely like a chicken taco that i'm having but the ingredients are very fresh everything on it is very tasty naturally the three cheese blend with that provolone the creaminess is adding to that as well which i actually loved in their philly cheesesteak pizza which you guys can take a look at me up right in corner of your display here right now that was pretty amazing it's adding just the right amount of pastiness and flavor to everything else that it's got so with that said the american cheese of course the cheddar cheese like i said part of the three cheese blend a beautiful thing and then with the onions the peppers the chicken itself just a very flavorful chicken pizza and hey it's nice that there's some onions on there as well i mean naturally i'm not really thinking of onions on chicken tacos anyway but for pizza of course onions is a pretty good thing so with that said i'm going to have to give the quote unquote chicken taco here at domino's a pretty decent 8.1 out of 10 it's getting the extra point above because the flavor is definitely there and i really appreciate the concept of what this is but like i said if they really want to make this one even more of a chicken taco it needs some type of taco seasoning some extra spice to really elevate it up because what i'm tasting right there doesn't really seem like it is it seems like it's trying to be but not quite but still very flavorful and still a recommendation to try just to satisfy the curiosity all right now the question is are you personally going to satisfy your curiosity with this one drop some comments down below what did you think of the overall ingredient set on this particular one did it seem like a chicken taco pizza to you drop those comments down below and also what's your favorite pizza over here at domino's drop those comments down and definitely let me know that as well and with that this
