 so it looks like Carl's jr. is going beyond once again with a brand new burger featuring beyond meat and I think this one may look a little familiar to ya so let's hit that drive-thru and set ourselves up welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty actually no but peep this out let me go for one of those new beyond barbecue cheeseburgers please just to the  burger by itself and that's it great thanks so are you getting a Western bacon cheeseburger vibe because I am yeah I'm getting Western bacon cheeseburger vibes is it similar kind of like that right thanks so much I appreciate it you too stay frosty we'll see ya all right guys let's peep this out we're going beyond flavor lit by fire by checking out there beyond barbecue cheeseburger and already guys that familiar aroma is letting up my car beautifully right now that barbecue sauce is very strong as always we've got that very wide sesame seed bun here on top let's pop it and take a look underneath looks like we've got plenty of that Hickory barbecue sauce all that goodness there we've got a slice of cheese and as you guys can see beyond meat patty guys looking really nice you can see those grill marks in there too and again it really does look like beef let me actually lift this up a little further for ya feels like beef two really really nice as you can see very very close to beef guys looking really really nice I don't need that we've got some onion ring pieces here it looks like and some more barbecue sauce so no bacon on this one for obvious reasons but guys it really does look pretty good I know some of you guys are gonna be saying well it's got a cheese slice on it guys it's not meant to be a fully vegan burger but this is a nice doppelgänger to a very familiar one known as the western bacon cheeseburger in effect here guys I got to say this looks really really tasty let's see if it does deliver that tasty flavor this is the beyond barbecue cheeseburger brand new here at Carl's jr. let's peep out this flavor right off the bat let me just say my initial gripe with this one is the appearance of it I mean everything does look pretty tasty with the exception of the onion rings guys they're not exactly onion rings in ring form their pieces that's the only thing that's really kind of killing this one right now I'm sure the flavor is gonna be there I'm sure it's gonna be decent but I really wish they were like solid onion rings you expect to see that right it is what it is so let's see exactly how this is but before I take that first bite and as always if you

every week so here we go the first brand new burger featuring beyond meat aside from the original which was fun to check out as well it's the beyond barbecue cheeseburger here at Carl's jr. yup alright right off the break let me just say this is instantly reminding me of the beyond Western bacon cheeseburger that I put together a few months back you guys can take a look at that review popping up on your screen right now that wasn't officially available on the menu then I was just very curious to try to beyond meat in that burger so essentially that's exactly what this is officially available under the BBQ cheeseburger name minus the bacon but guys because of the smaller ingredients list on this one you can actually taste the beyond meat a little bit more cleanly I should say it really stands out just a little bit more without being masked with everything and just like the beyond famous star that Carl's jr. initially launched back earlier this year that one actually had the luxury of having all those toppings together so without all of that you actually have more of a chance to taste the beyond meat and I gotta say it is pretty tasty guys it really is pretty good so let's go for another bite and I'll definitely give you that close-up well given the lighter ingredients list on this one I can actually taste the cheese with that BBQ sauce it's a nice combination along with the crispiness of those onion ring pieces on the bottom and as you guys can see the beyond meat patty on the inside featuring that pea protein goodness it really is pretty good even if it's a little on the dry side which these plant-based burgers tend to be this one is actually really really tasty and again it goes amazingly well with that barbecue sauce it's a nice combination well what can I say it really is a Western bacon cheeseburger minus the bacon I mean it would have been nice to have that extra flavor on top of the Beyond meat because it's flavorful on its own but again if you really want to see what that one's all about after I put it together unofficially again take a look at that review in the top right corner but to have an official version of this available without the Western name I don't know why they didn't just put Western cheeseburger on this one here I think it would have been a nice thing just don't put bacon in it but again it is what it is it's beyond meat it's the tastiness you already know from that burger with the familiar ingredients although a little on the lighter side from Carl's jr. not bad though mmm alright let's do a little 360 action on this one because it is a super wide burger and as you can see I think a pretty good value for the money considering the size guys plenty of that barbecue sauce as you can see in the back there the onion ring pieces although I do wish they were the rings like I mentioned but the familiar flavor of the pea-based patty from beyond meat is definitely lighting this one up and the cheese you can actually taste again with that barbecue sauce not bad whatsoever and a nice evolutionary step up from the western bacon cheeseburger minus the bacon okay now you can definitely add bacon to this one to make it exactly like the burger that I reviewed a while back and that's actually not a very bad thing I would recommend that you do that because I do believe it's missing that little extra touch considering what it's trying to emulate and I only say that because when you see this burger on the menu next to the western bacon cheeseburger how could you not help but think it's gonna be exactly like that right I mean it pretty much is so with that said I'm gonna have to give the Beyond barbecue cheeseburger here at Carl's jr. just a decent 7.8 out of 10 where it really lost the points for me initially is really just the juiciness that I wish could have been there just a little bit more on top of the onion rings that were kind of mashed up there that was really the only thing appearance wise flavor wise very familiar but again like I said if you really want that experience you got to do the bacon for all your vegans out there I get it it still has cheese on it but guys this needs bacon you need to add it because I'm telling you I really wish I had it right now so after what you've just seen and especially after the breakdown of this one right now what do you personally think of this one drop some comments down below are you a fan of beyond meat in general and if you are how excited are you to give this version officially available on the menu in barbecue form at Carl's jr. drop some comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K closing out another episode of peep this out bringing you brand new content every single week here on my
