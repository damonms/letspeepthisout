 what's going on everyone and welcome back to  another high quality foodie feature for you   here on the channel where this time i've returned  to carl's jr because after checking out their blt   ranch hand breaded chicken sandwich recently i  noticed they brought back something that looked   pretty tasty to go along with it that actually  goes back to one of my first reviews here on the   channel that's right you already know what it  is feast your eyes on the returning bacon fries   and already i'm digging the amount of chopped  bacon on the top of this one guys not only does   it look pretty appetizing it looks nice and  crispy so very simply what we've got here is   a portion of their natural cut fries featuring  a little bit of that potato skin on the outside   topped off with some ranch and lots of crispy  bacon guys this is actually looking fairly decent   for the portion size so let's see if the flavor is  going to deliver on this one because with all this   bacon how could it not this is the returning bacon  ranch fries here at carl's jr let's peep out this   flavor yesir for those of you who have been  with me since the very beginning or if you've   perused the carl's jr playlist you're probably  going to notice i reviewed the bacon fries way   back in the day about seven years ago and from  what i remember the experience wasn't the best for   me and honestly this portion size looks a little  bit smaller than what i reviewed that first time   but there's plenty of bacon and it seems just more  inviting and it's definitely aromatic guys the   bacon is pretty awesome here so let's get this one  going here guys i'm in between projects right now   i thought i'd take a little quick break and swing  on over to carl's jr and give this one a shot   and i gotta say guys again really digging the  amount of bacon on here right now what i'm   noticing already though is there's really not a  lot of ranch on this but let's see what is here if   it tastes pretty decent here we go this is already  better already from what i remember the bacon is   plentiful you know it's going to be hickory smoked  goodness let me go for a little bit more here   man they actually have it all  throughout which is really good here so   they're bacon bits so it's kind of chopped  very small so they can pile it on i kind   of wish there was some bigger chunks here but at  the same time not bad so far let's keep going in the ranch is tangy what little of it i do have   very vibrant flavor with this definitely better  experience and just because i want to get a lot   of bacon with one bite here oh this is actually  not bad here we go take a look at that there   some glory shots as it focuses in nice and  crispy on this guys fairly warm the natural   skin that you can see on the fries here the  ranch is decent what is here is definitely   flavorful but like i said i wish i had just  a little bit more of it i think they were a   little too reserved when they were pouring some  of the ranch on this but let's just keep going in my bacon's banging well now that i've uncovered  a portion of the bacon as you can see i'm not   kidding when they say there's hardly any ranch  on this there's just a little bit all throughout   here but there's plenty of bacon which i'm  really digging but obviously the crispiness of   the fries this is a better experience flavor-wise  compared to what i did the first time around from   what i remember but overall like i said i really  wish there was just more ranch but what is here   is definitely jumping out at least in the bacon  department for sure with a little bit of the tang   of that ranch yeah this is definitely a better  flavor experience compared to what i remember   from about seven or so years ago and from what  i also remember i believe the portion size that   time around was a lot bigger as well i think  they actually filled up one of their standard   burger boxes with more fries and obviously the  ranch and the bacon but obviously with this   this is actually $3.99 for a smaller portion  size but you're getting better flavor this   time around compared to having a lot more the  last time out and not really having any flavor   so i guess the trade-off is the portion  size and flavor obviously but at the same   time i'm really glad this is actually singing  right now in the flavor department but again   and i'm gonna beat this one to death i wish there  was just a little bit more ranch but what is here   is definitely a banging situation guys plenty of  bacon i really like that and the crispiness of the   fries is very solid with this so overall can't  really complain too much except for maybe the   price point just a little bit so with everything  you've seen and heard up to this point i'm gonna   have to give the returning bacon ranch fries  here at carl's jr a pretty decent 7 out of 10 from what i remember the last time i think  it was a mediocre type of score but with this   it's definitely a better flavor experience  like i mentioned earlier but the portion size   is literally half of what i remember that's really  the only thing it's a little bit more expensive   and you're getting less food but the quality seems  to be better even though the ranch is a little bit   on the lighter side but what is there is pretty  tangy overall just okay all right so i've got a   couple of quick questions for you for those of  you who may have tried these bacon ranch fries   back in the day about seven or so years ago along  with trying them recently how did you personally   like the quality of them did you notice a  difference in terms of the overall flavor   drop those comments down below and definitely  let me know and with that this is Ian K   closing out another high quality foodie feature  for you here on peep the sound reviews bringing   you brand new content every single week here on  my channel so while you stay tuned for that next review
