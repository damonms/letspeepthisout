 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty hey everyone I'm back at it this time over at wing stop to take a look at a lunch combo they've got on the menu that I didn't even know they had until I checked out their mobile app so let's see what's up but this crispy tender lunch combo here at Wing Stop and already a very crispy situation lots of fried goodness in the car here right now guys starting off with the main event here at the very end 100 percent white meat chicken fried up to a crispy golden brown these three crispy tenders are looking pretty nice drizzled very liberally with their Hawaiian sauce I decided to go with combination of sweet and tangy with a little fruity blend of Island citrus that they're calling it and a little bit of Asian Flair thrown into the mix as well so smells very pineappley I got to say very very nice situation there next to that we've got a very heavy-handed portion of their standard fries a very lovely situation we've got fry seasoning some salt nice amount I gotta say guys again very heavy-handed good stuff and I decided to go with Arnold Palmer half lemonade half iced tea for the drink so for five bucks not a bad deal at all I'm definitely big in the portion size and the price is right for five bucks let's see if the flavor is gonna deliver it's the crispy tender lunch combo here at Wingstop let's peep out this flavor yeah this has definitely got some Hawaiian flair going I'm getting a lot of pineapple aroma off of this one with a little bit of heat believe it or not in my nose right when I took a little sniff of that real quick I felt like a little bit of a burn so I think I'm gonna be in for a fun time with this one right now so let's get into it but first things first if you guys are fans of high quality

it's the crispy tender lunch combo we're gonna be focusing primarily on this chicken cuz that's where it should be right now guys this looks really really tasty nice and big nice and thick let's give this Hawaiian flavor a shot mmm okay ooh that is really sweet it is so sweet it's like gritting your teeth type of sweet has a lot of sugar I got to admit guys but the chicken is very nice it's nice and juicy even though it is white meat and white meat as always tends to be a little bit drier on average compared to dark meat but I have to say the quantity of the white meat along with that coating that actually the ratio is nice and this guys I want to say it's almost 50/50 believe it or not let's go for another bite and I'll give you that close up but so far pretty tasty on this mmm definitely a solid piece of white meat in this strip guys it really doesn't taste overly fried either so it's very soft but a little bit of crunch to it but a really nice amount of flavor on this one the outside coating definitely a lovely situation but that sauce is just a little strong in the sugar department that's really the only thing but lots of pineapple flavor not too much heat though just a little bit of sizzle let me know that's there but guys a very very solid amount of meat and three of these guys for five bucks along with fries and a drink so far pretty good value I'm not really a fan of super sweet sauces in general so naturally this is not going to be my first choice but for you guys I wanted to give it a shot and honestly I really wanted to see how that Hawaiian flavor was gonna come through was it gonna be more pineapple because that's what I'm thinking when I think of Hawaiian type of sauces it's got plenty of pineapple guys I don't know about the Asian Flair too much maybe the sweetness and the tang slightly but it's really more of a pineapple type of glaze if anything but super sweet that's the only thing yeah very sweet and hey you know what I'm really glad that I've got some fries to go with this right now because I think the saltiness is gonna help with that overall sweetness let me grab a couple of these real fast let's get into it right away cuts it right away nice saltiness I'm a big fan of natural cut fries like this where they have the skin on the outside and the fact that they're using some salt along with it they're very reminiscent of the Wendy's fries actually but just a little bit crispier supposedly this fries seasoning adds a little bit more to it and what it's really adding what that really is is a little bit of sugar just a little bit but there's enough saltiness to offset that along with the fried coating of the fry itself pretty tasty and hey for any of you wondering why I don't have any dipping sauce to go with this chicken even though it is glazed typically you have something on the side to go with it much less some ketchup to go with the fries I could have gotten some ketchup with these but naturally I wanted to focus more of the chicken wing stuff doesn't give you an extra dipping sauce unless you pay for it so the quality of what you're getting for the chicken is really good but they don't throw in anything extra sauce wise except the flavor that you're gonna be getting with the meal so a little no bueno for that but still it is what it is all right let me knock out this fry real fast and I'll give you one final look at that chicken guys before we wrap this one up mmm tasty all right I just speared the end of this crispy tender with the fork to give you a full-length view of what you're getting with this one here and as you can see up close again a very solid amount of white meat chicken with a decent amount of coating that doesn't overpower one or the other I'm really liking the fact that the meat to the breading ratio is very solid virtually even and as you can see a very generous amount of sauce on this one lovely situation overall and again for five bucks for three long chicken tenders like this along with the fries and the drink nicely done mmm you got a love Arnold Palmer iced tea and lemonade lovely combination alright guys so overall after everything you've seen here right now in the review I think you have a pretty good idea of how I feel about this one it's decent don't get me wrong but I would have loved to have had an additional sauce to dip into that quality of the sauce is pretty tasty on those chicken tenders as well just a little too sweet for me that's really the only thing but the overall bangin value you're gonna get for five bucks is solid and the quality of the flavor is pretty decent so with that said I'm gonna have to give the crispy tender lunch combo here a wingstop an 8.1 out of 10 it's just a little over eight because I love the quality of the chicken itself the sauce is not really my favorite I think had I gotten maybe a barbecue or standard ranch I think drizzled all over it even plain that would have been I think a better choice for that but I'm glad I chose the Hawaiian like I said the heat is not really there even though initially I thought it was gonna be but the sweetness is just too much for me but a decent quality value meal and like I said for five bucks you really can't hate on what you get in there pretty decent now of course the question is do you think this looks pretty decent drop some comments down below what did you think of the overall presentation of his crispy tender lunch combo here at Wingstop and first off are you actually a fan of the crispy tenders here to begin with this is my very first time trying them and I would easily get him again essentially what I'm really having here is to regular boneless nuggets put together but naturally having it in the long strip form was pretty good but are you a fan of them in general drop those comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K closing out another episode of peep this out bringing you brand-new content every single week here
