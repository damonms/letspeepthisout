 what's going on everyone and welcome back to  another high quality foodie feature for you   here on the channel where this time i'm over  at pizza hut to check out the return of their   detroit style pizza only this time around there's  a brand new option available for it that's right   and of course i'm definitely going to explain  it for you so stay tuned because it's up next   welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty so here we go with the returning detroit style  pizza here at pizza hut and already those memories   are coming back to me with how tasty this was the  first time around guys this is already looking   pretty awesome so what you're looking at here is  eight pieces of rectangular shaped goodness along   with plenty of cheese all the way to the edge and  it's topped off with vine ripened tomato sauce   on either side of this one and that's definitely a  differentiating ingredient with this one it looks   really great and with all the cheese on this  one it means we've got some caramelized crusty   edges definitely a lovely situation those corner  pieces for sure are going to be the highlight   but the difference overall this time around for  this detroit style pizza is the fact for the first   time officially you can actually customize this  with up to five toppings off the menu so for all   of you peeps who love to change things around  a bit and not just go for the standard options   you definitely have the ability to create your own  now and as for my personal choice i decided to go   the hawaiian route and i'll definitely explain  why as we get further in so let's do just that   this is the returning detroit style pizza here  at pizza hut let's peep out this flavor yes sir   the presentation looks very inviting on this one  guys and like i said during the initial close-up   having tomato sauce on the top of the pizza  is a real differentiating factor with this   one because visually it looks pretty awesome and  it's completely different so let me pull up one   of these corner pieces here and i'll explain why  i went to hawaiian route and well we'll get into   this but wow this is really hefty just like i  remember the first time around as this begins   to focus in that tomato sauce action plenty of  pineapple plenty of ham on this particular one   the toastiness on the very bottom and those  caramelized edges are just banging on this   right now let's give this a shot guys i  can't wait to get into this one it's the   detroit style pizza returning here to pizza hut in  hawaiian form at least for me anyway let's do it already yeah this is definitely got the denseness  that i remember the first time around guys it's   a very thick piece of pizza naturally and  of course when you have all the toppings on   this one in this case that tomato sauce is  standing out to me along with the juiciness   of the pineapple believe it or not i was  getting a lot of little squirts from that   really really tasty it's definitely different  along with the ham plenty of cheese haven't   quite got to the caramelized edges on this one  yet but it's a beautiful presentation on this one   and again that tomato sauce the vine ripened  goodness definitely an upscale version of tomato   sauce over here pizza hut it's pretty tasty let's  keep going in with the caramelized edge here we go hmm crispy light oiliness from it banging  and because this little piece is staring   at me here right now before the next  close-up let's go for another bite all right so let me ask you does pineapple really  belong in a detroit style pizza much less any   pizza at all drop some comments down below and  let's get the conversation going with this one   it's always a controversial topic but i have to  admit it works very well because the vine ripened   tomato sauce here is blending with the juiciness  of that pineapple and it's adding a little   zip to it which i really like along with the  ham the caramelized edge goodness right there   you already know what it is definitely a lovely  situation and a fairly thick piece of pizza really   really nice you can see the airiness of it right  there it's crunchy and light but dense at the same   time just a lovely situation so far with this oh  and real quick let me just mention if you're a   huts rewards member you're going to have exclusive  access to pick this one up beginning august 24th   and then august 25th it's going to be available  to everyone so if you're watching this on the 24th   check your app check the website chances are  it's going to be there for you definitely give   this a go and for everyone else august 25th on  for a limited time only of course right let's   go for another couple of bites on this guys i'm  really digging it the quality is really tasty you know now that i think about it this really  hasn't been off the menu too long over here at   pizza hut but considering how successful it  was when it came around the first time which   was a blast to check out take a look at the  description box down below for two different   versions that i reviewed back then with it  back in the menu so soon this easily ranks   as like the fastest time they brought a limited  time promo back in probably like 10 years or so   this is really something special guys and  obviously i think they know they've got a   good thing going with this one here guys and  the fact that you can customize it officially   this time around that's another bonus but again  it's all about the caramelized goodness it's all   about the overall flavor those ripened tomatoes  are really awesome on this and just in general   even the pineapple even the ham  definitely a banging situation   all right so let's go for one more bite one  more close-up of this one and then we'll wrap   it up but guys again i'm so glad this is back  on the menu right now and even the hawaiian   version of it i got to say ranks up there it is  still pretty tasty all right guys one more bite all right so let's take another look at one  more slice of this and as you can see guys again   very very lovely situation with the amount  of dough that you're getting here of course   it's got a little bit of height to it as well  the caramelized edges all the way around this   one a beautiful situation those corner pieces  are going to be the most sought after by far   but depending upon your choice of toppings  you have a lot of goodness to blend in with   the vine ripened tomato sauce on this one guys it  really does add to this overall and again visually   very very nice i'm so glad this one is back tasty  stuff all right so wherever you fall on the scale   of pineapple belongs on a pizza or pineapple  doesn't belong on a pizza no matter where you   are in between on this one you can't deny that  the flavor is pretty interesting and especially   when you combine it with detroit style like i did  right now that is just a banging combination guys   of course the base that i'm working with is  already tasty starting off right there i mean   the cheese the caramelized edges around it just a  beautiful situation all around and while i'm not   going to give my version of this a rating because  naturally i concocted it myself in addition to   being supplied this pizza by pizza hut thanks guys  i appreciate that greatly let me just say you have   some great options available to you with this one  and again with all the toppings they have on the   menu i'm very curious to know what you guys are  going to be doing topping wise when you decide to   give this one a shot again or for the first time  if you're trying it for the first time so do me   a quick favor do just that drop some comments  down below let me know your perfect combination   of toppings that you think you're gonna go with  for the detroit style pizza now that it's back   on the menu for at least a limited time only how  many times are you going to be giving it a shot   drop some comments down below and definitely let  me know and with that this is Ian K closing out   another high quality foodie feature for you here  on peep
