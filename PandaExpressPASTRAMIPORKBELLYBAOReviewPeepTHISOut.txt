 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty looks like the Panda Express innovation kitchen in Pasadena California just dropped their latest test item and if you're a fan of Taiwanese Street food and pastrami let's just say you've got a reason to sit up and take notice that's right and as you just saw it's they're currently in test pastrami bao bun and the presentation is really nice on this already guys I'm really digging in the size of it as well for $2.75 looking really nice and of course I'm absolutely digging the light fluffy airiness of the bao bun itself this is looking really really great on the inside we've got a fairly thick slice of pork belly it's actually slow-cooked and marinated in pastrami spices along with some Hickory liquid smoke flavor so that's actually gonna be really really nice I think overall to go with that you've got some pickled cucumbers on the top there three slices and what looks like a very sweet type of teriyaki type of sauce I should say on the very inside of this lined on the top and bottom so looking really great I'm very excited to give this one a go let's just do just that this is the pastrami bao bun currently in test at the Panda Express innovation kitchen in Pasadena California let's peep out this flavor you know I'm so glad this actually comes with a paper sleeve right now and I think the reason they do that is because the bao bun itself does kind of stick to your fingers just a bit it's got like a steamed type of feel but it's very light very soft but naturally because it's that type of texture it's absorbing all of the sauce on the inside so nicely that it's splitting the very bottom so the protection is definitely a good thing I'm glad that it's here let's not waste any more time we're gonna get into this right now but like always if you guys are fans of high quality delicious looking food reviews make sure to hit that subscribe button down below and don't forget to tap that belly icon so you could be notified as soon as brand-new content drops every week here we go it's the pastrami bao bun currently in test for Panda Express at the innovation kitchen here in Pasadena California let's do it mmm soft very soft going into that mm-hmm that's tasty I'm getting some ly pastrami spices from the actual pork belly itself but where this is really shining right now is the sauce as well as that bao bun the softness and the deliciousness of it is coming through amazing add in the fact that you've got some nice thickness of the pork belly on top of those pickled cucumbers and that combination blends together just amazingly with everything else and again on top of the light airiness of that bao bun pretty lovely situation let's go for another bite and I'll give you that close-up it's pretty good mmm you definitely get some nice notes of hickory as you get further into this one guys but the real stars of the show are easily gonna be the bao bun the sauce and those pickled cucumbers believe it or not it's really a dominant flavor profile overall and then the flavor of the pork belly comes through at the very end so I love the combination when it's all together but you do get more of it altogether as you get further in but very tasty and hey let me just say after reviewing the honey glazed pork belly back in the day as well as the orange chicken burrito here at the Panda Express innovation kitchen I personally believe the quality of this particular item right now should be on the menu permanently because I could easily see myself getting something like on the side like in terms of the main dish that I'm getting I'll just add one of these pastrami bao buns to go with it the size is decent the quality is good and I have to admit it's a nice heartiness which really does deliver across the board pretty tasty flavor so let me go for one more bite of that flavor and then we'll close this one out with the rating and the wrap-up hang on mmm well let's go for one more close-up on this one guys and I'll definitely go 360 to give you a nice look at this one again but as you can see from my fingers on top that bao bun does stick to your fingers so it's nice to know that you actually have that sleeve to go with but the flavor overall does deliver on this one the thickness of that pork belly is awesome and again the sauce is a real highlight on this one even though it does kind of overpower in general the nice quality of the pork belly is awesome and let me swing this around just a little bit more cuz it is sticking of my fingers like mad a very decent size for $2.75 guys very solid quality and again I'd love to see this one on the menu permanently it's pretty tasty so with that said I'm gonna have to give the pastrami Bao bun currently in test here at the Panda Express innovation kitchen in Pasadena California a pretty decent 8 out of 10 everything was very flavorful on this guy's don't get me wrong I really enjoyed it but if there's one thing I could probably make a recommendation on maybe limit the sauce just a little bit maybe just a little less possibly because it really does overpower the flavor of everything in that and I really would have liked to have tasted the pork belly just a little bit more but overall still very tasty now the question is considering this is only available at the Panda Express innovation kitchen here in Pasadena is this something that you think you personally like to see nationwide drop some comments down below and let me know if it's something that you'd like to see and also if you're a fan of pork belly in general I'd love to know that as well drop those comments down below and definitely let me know and without this is Ian K closing out another episode of peep this out bringing you
