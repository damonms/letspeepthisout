 welcome to peep this out  reviews with ian k stay frosty hey everyone welcome back to another high quality  foodie feature for you here on the channel where   this time i'm back on over at wendy's to check  out the return of ghost pepper to their menu   only this time it's part of an all-new ranch  sauce that looks perfect for their spicy nuggs   that's right and as you already know it's the very  simply named ghost pepper ranch sauce pretty nice   guys i'm definitely digging the foil packaging on  this one for sure i can't wait to give this a go   and i'm expecting a little bit of heat naturally  but of course the nice cool ranch action that's   gonna go with it i think it's gonna be pretty  good wendy's has some pretty good ranch anyway   so i'm hoping this is gonna be solid so let me  open this up really quick we'll get a quick aroma   test of it it's nice and ranchy looking actually  smells more like kind of like a mayoe type of   ranch than anything else i'm not really getting  any spices of it but as you can see the spicing   looks like it's mixed pretty nicely all throughout  and again i love ranch anyway and this looks very   very thick all right so we're going to start  off with is some of their spicy nuggs naturally   that's how they're advertising this of course a  quick little four piece but i've got two other   things we're going to dip into so hang tight for  that guys i think you're going to definitely want   to see what i'm about to do but here we go let's  give this a shot let's go for a little dunk here   yeah nice and ranchy definitely the  spicing looks pretty nice all throughout   let's give this a shot it's the all-new ghost  pepper ranch sauce here at wendy's let's do it a little bit of sizzle on  this but also from the chicken   wow that's beginning to really pick up now nice  and steamy whoa i am digging this guys very nice   i'm definitely glad i brought some water  too aside from it being crazy hot outside   as you can see this is really the perfect pairing  for something like this it only makes me more   excited to try something else here in a minute  for you wow my voice is beginning to go already   this has got some nice heat it's pretty good mmm  oh yeah let's do one more nug because why not   man i am digging this a little bit of the  cool action to kind of bring it down just a bit   but i really love how the spicing is even across  the board this is a beautiful mix of goodness and   like i said a little bit of the coolness but  that heat is really still continuing to build   up it's not really dissipating because of the  ranch but it's definitely there pretty good oh yeah they need to keep this on the  menu big time this is really really good   all right one more time man let me give you  some more glory shots it's just a dipping sauce   after all but even still it's done the wendy's  way i'm trying to keep that focus for you again   really digging the amount of spice this  has got it's noticeably elevated   as you'd expect it to be it's  ghost pepper right here we go man i should have got maybe a 10 piece  nugg aside from what i'm going to do right   now for you man looks really good and real quick  before we move on let me grab some water real fast i think that's kind of making it worse actually  but even still it's wet it's definitely helping   somewhat i guess but still i am really digging the  quality of the sauce here guys and as you can see   nice mixture of the goodies okay so how could you  come to wendy's and just do nuggs and not want to   put it on a chicken sandwich with this sauce  right so that's what i'm going to do right   now for you let me get this one opened up here and  i'll get this ready to roll pop it open here let   me grab one of the sauces all right there we go  we're going to pop this open i actually picked up   a free classic chicken sandwich minus the tomato  and minus the mayo thanks to that code underneath   the pringles the wendy's spicy chicken pringles  that i reviewed not that long ago so that's   definitely a beautiful situation in and of itself  because we're really going to get this thing   lathered up just a bit so we can really give this  a shot with this all-new ghost pepper ranch sauce   all right let me pop this lid back  on there we go and as you can see   this is gonna be the real deal right here  why they don't have a sandwich with this   yet i don't know but i'm making it for you  right now we're gonna try it real quick it's   the classic chicken sandwich with the all new  ghost pepper ranch sauce here wendys let's do it come on all day long   and this is the spicy patty on top of it  so i'm already starting to have a problem   let's go for another bite guys i'll give you a  close-up and then i gotta get some water hang on man oh yeah more often than not it's a beautiful  chicken sandwich eating experience over here at   wendy's and when you pair up this all-new ghost  pepper ranch sauce with the peppery goodness   from the actual spicy chicken patty itself guys  it's a beautiful situation i'm having trouble   talking already and guys honestly again with  the sauce being what it is it's adding that much   heat to the situation here right now and i'm  digging it this is really a beautiful pairing   so much so that i got to take a time out real  quick because like i said aside from it being   crazy hot outside this is lighting up my mouth  big time it's delicious though it really is   mmm man good times good times alright one  more bite of this and there's something else   i want to try for you real fast because i'm super  curious about it and some of you asked me about   this in the last review i did from wendy's  with the pringles hint hint hold on one second come on that's just a beautiful situation as  long as this ghost pepper ranch sauce is out i'm   absolutely going to be adding it to my chicken  sandwiches over here at wendy's on the side of   any reviews i may be doing from them this is a  beautiful thing guys the ranch goodness the creamy   goodness it's got a little tanginess to it but  the heat along with the awesome flavor from that   ghost pepper ranch sauce is going so beautifully  with this i mean it's fried chicken with ranch   and that's definitely a bonus right there but  a little bit of extra heat definitely a lovely   situation so speaking of said pringles let me put  this off to the side here and because i bought two   canisters of the wendy's spicy chicken pringles  when i reviewed these you're probably seeing that   review jumping up on your screen or maybe the  playlist for wendy's jumping up on your screen   we're gonna give this a go to see how that ghost  pepper ranch sauce is with the pringles variant   of the wendy's spicy chicken and guess what i've  got another code for another chicken sandwich you   better believe i'm gonna be using it with this  ghost pepper ranch all right let me bring up one   of these we'll pop this down over here and let me  pick up another ranch i have one that's open here   let's give this a shot this almost looks like  it's gonna fit inside the container actually   so here we go there you go with what you already  know of what you've seen already and let's do a   little pringle action spicy chicken from wendy's  and pringles together let's try it like this that's delicious that is freaking delicious hang  on man let me put my water off to the side here   and we'll put the canister over here because we're  gonna do a few of these this is really tasty the   saltiness that i'm getting from the pringle and  that chicken broth like flavor that i'm getting   and the actual spiciness that it's already got  anyway because that's what it's simulating this   is a pretty good pringle anyway but guys with the  ghost pepper ranch this is pretty fun right now   absolutely i guess if you still got some stuff  left in the containers when you're done eating   your meal you have some pringles coincidentally  with you it's nice dipping sauce just for that   it's not all about the nuggs guys it's  whatever else you can find to try and make   whatever else you're eating tastes pretty  good and this is actually pretty tasty so   very lovely situation one more on this but as you  can see i am so glad to have given this a shot   this is definitely worth checking out especially  if you like heat guys for fast food this is   noticeably elevated and the quality is pretty nice  beautiful stuff over here at wendy's with this one   yeah definitely a beautiful situation with this  one guys i mean the ghost pepper ranch sauce of   course goes beautifully with their spicy nuggs for  a reason that combination of that pairing is a   beautiful thing but when you pair that up with the  classic chicken sandwich spicy or regular i'm sure   it's going to be just as fine the added kick that  you're going to get from the spicy chicken itself   really adds another layer another dimension to it  and overall it's still pretty delicious but hey   let's not forget about the pringles aspect of it  because like i said with that new promo out right   now for the limited edition pringles the spicy  chicken variant it still goes pretty nicely and   the spicing is very similar i mean you're getting  the same ghost pepper ranch sauce naturally but   the spicing on the chip itself is very apparent  the chicken broth like flavor is a little bit more   minimized because of the heat and the tanginess  and the tartness of the ranch itself but the   combination is nice and it's crunchy and super fun  to eat so still pretty delicious so with all that   said i'm gonna have to give this all new ghost  pepper ranch sauce here at wendy's a rock solid   9 out of 10 and the only reason i'm not giving  it the perfect 10 out of 10 is because for me   classic ranch is always going to be the very top  i mean it's just a beautiful situation in general   but if you're looking for something a little bit  more heated this is noticeably elevated especially   for fast food heat and that's really the beautiful  thing about that it's a very even mix across the   board and that ghost pepper flavor really is  jumping out at you guys you're gonna notice it   right away when you bite into it no matter what  you put it on if it's chicken nuggets if it's   chicken sandwiches or even the pringles the spicy  chicken pringles you already know what to expect   pretty tasty stuff all right so i already know  if you've made it this far into the review you're   going to be giving this one a go and when you do  are you going to be experimenting with this one   drop some comments down below let me know  if you're going to put this on the chicken   sandwich that i just did right now or how about  the pringles are you going to go and complete   the trifecta aside from those nuggets drop those  comments down below and definitely let me know   and with that this is Ian K closing out another  high quality foodie feature for you out here on   peep this out reviews bringing you brand new  content every single week here on my channel   so while you stay tuned for that next review coming real soon  in the meantime stay frosty yeah nothing against   the spicy nuggs over here at wendy's i think we can  all pretty much agree their some of the best fast   food nuggets out there and of course the ghost  pepper ranch sauce is gonna pair beautifully   with it but guys again you can't fade the fact  that it needs to be on a chicken sandwich this   ghost pepper ranch needs a full-fledged sandwich  to be created for it it really does i'm glad i   actually did that for you guys today all right  everyone until next time i'll talk to you soon   hey thanks for checking out another  one of my reviews but just in case   you didn't see the one before this one you  can find it right up over here along what i   think youtube's gonna recommend for you to  check out as well as always i think you'll   find something like both of them and i'll  definitely catch you in the next one see ya
