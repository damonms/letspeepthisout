 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty well happy new year and welcome back to another  high quality foodie feature for you here on the   channel guys where this time i'm over at panda  express because they're actually testing shanghai   ribs at a location fairly close to me and i gotta  admit these are looking pretty awesome up on their   menu and as tasty as i think that actually looks  it looks even better live feast your eyes on this   guys this is a lovely situation what we've got  here is a fairly decent portion of pork ribs   doused in a savory sweet tangy glaze and  it's topped off with some sesame seeds   i've got it on a bed of their famous chow mein  it's definitely one of my favorites over here   but man guys these are looking nice and meaty and  i gotta say nice and juicy there is plenty of that   glazed goodness all throughout this right now and  i'm absolutely digging this presentation so real   quick before i get my hands dirty with this one  and before we get into it a huge shout out and   thank you over to chewboom for posting up on this  along with getting snacky with darrel aka darrel   dupit i hope i didn't butcher that last name darrel just in case if you're watching this right now   but he actually managed to find a location out  his way that actually had these on the menu as   well and i got to admit guys again a very lovely  situation on the presentation here this looks   very very appetizing so let me lift up one of  these here we'll get into this a lovely meaty   situation wow these are thick that is nice  look at that chunk of meaty goodness right   there guys i'm really digging the sesame  seed accent on the top supposedly a nice   sweet savory glaze on this one here and nice  and meaty and pork ribs are the bomb so let's   give this a shot guys it's the currently in test  shanghai ribs here at panda express let's do it tender oh yeah all day long already nice and  meaty wow and you know what honestly it's not even   really super sweet for something that's supposed  to be kind of tangy and savory sweet it's not grit   your teeth type of sweet which is really good  so you can really taste the quality of the meat   itself and those pork ribs as it focuses in as you  can see a very meaty lovely situation the sauce   itself is really sticking to the bone there guys  that is a lovely situation it's very thick so   obviously it's going to go very nice with the chow  mein i have underneath it but a lovely situation   guys i can't keep saying it because it is it's  a crazy lovely situation let's keep going in oh yeah you know i'm a huge fan of spare ribs  and it's been a minute since they've been on   the menu here at panda and considering that's  something that you'd expect to see it should   be a permanent option in my opinion the fact  that this is actually out right now at least   temporarily at a test location shows that  they really are thinking about hopefully   bringing this nationwide and they really should  because this is a beautiful situation again   keep track of those beautiful situations  throughout the review really really tasty let me give you a shot of the biggest one in  this bowl right now guys take a look at that   the bone is on the very bottom and that is all  meat that i'm holding right on the top as well   as the very top of your screen this is just  a lovely situation here guys nice and glazed   it really is lovely here really really nice  look at that nice and meaty too there i'm   very impressed with the size of this considering  the premium it's a dollar 25 upgrade to get this   about $4.60 or so a la carte these are easily worth your time because the flavor is crazy and there's   a lot of pieces that have a decent amount  of meat lovely guys lovely situation indeed   all right so let's go for a bite of the big one  because i can't hold off any longer let's do it tender and juicy wow that was so good you  know the really good thing about this also   is it's not very fatty there are some nice  thick chunks of meat throughout this guys   and even though there's a little bit of grizzle  in it just a little bit what you're getting more   is the pork that you're expecting here and again  that glaze sauce that savory sauce that it's got   is not overly sweet but again a very heavy  teriyaki vibe that i'm getting with this one   and of course the accent of the sesame seeds  beautiful guys beautiful indeed and if you're   wondering why i haven't gotten into the chow  mein just yet i'm trying to make my way down to   it because i am digging these guys but naturally  i have a lot of that sauce from these ribs here   actually on the top of it here i'm going to get  into that in just a second but guys very very   nice in terms of the quality and again i think  this is a good showpiece for you right here very   very solid just in terms of the thickness of the  pork on it and again very very juicy and tender   that's a beautiful situation these are fairly  fresh they are mom all right because i am curious   finger looking good indeed let me grab a fork i'm  going to grab a little of the chow mein action   and show you that i've got some of that sauce  in the very top the oiliness that i'm seeing   from their chow mein which is a little bit of  a light soy and obviously the cooking oil that   they're using here again i think it's going to go  very nicely with some of the sauce that i have on   the very top let me give this a shot we'll  wipe this on just a bit let's give it a go   hmm oh yeah that's sweetness a familiar soy taste  of their chow meim now let me go for one more   with that that is really really good really  good actually i kind of prefer the chow mein   over the fried rice over here at panda if you guys  agree with that drop some comments down below let   me know what you actually get when you get your  stuff over at panda but i'm always a fan of the   chow mein and naturally with the sauce that  i've got here it's really really good oh yeah   all right so let's go for one more bite of this  big guy right over here and we'll give you another   close-up and we'll finish this one out but guys  a lovely situation again i'm not sure how many   times i've said it throughout the review but it  is really really worth it because the sauce on   this is beautiful the tenderness of the pork is  beautiful and overall the experience has been   pretty solid with this i would love to see this  go nationwide it is pretty banging let's go for it well clearly panda knows what they're doing with  this one because if you decide to get the fried   rice you can expect that to all be soaked up  very beautifully with the sauce here guys this   is really really done very well it's not overly  sticky it is thick but the sweetness is on point   and again the meatiness of these ribs is very  well done not too much fat there is a decent   amount of meat but again you're getting fall  off the bone type of goodness right over here   which has a flavor very distinct just by having  it separately by itself guys it really is nice   to have it this way and it is super fun to eat  if a little on the messy side but guys with all   this in front of you right now i'm not complaining  i'm really not so with that said i'm gonna have to   give the currently end test shanghai ribs here at  panda express in southern california a rock solid   9 out of 10 now my main gripe with this  and it tends to be the same pretty much with   the current trend in fast food lately is the fact  that this is a little on the pricey side at $4.60   or so a la carte about nine dollars including  a one-item bowl which is what i have right now   that's a little pricey so i would have liked  to have seen just a few more pieces for what   i got now granted what i did get was flavorful but  again you are paying a premium they do say premium   a buck 25 upgrade for a reason this needs to be  maybe just a couple of pieces more to make it   worth it but even still at almost 10 dollars it's  up there but guys if you've got this in the area   i would easily recommend it because the flavor is  pretty banging so for all the complaining that i   do about the price of some of these things lately  which i'm sure you guys are probably thinking the   same thing at least it's delivered on taste and  i got to admit that's really where it counts so   do me a quick favor drop some comments down below  did this actually satisfy your expectation of what   you're expecting with this review did this look  pretty awesome right now and would you like to see   it go national drop those comments down below and  definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K   closing out another high quality foodie feature
