 hey everyone welcome back to another high quality  foodie feature for you here in the channel   cheaters cam style after hours over a jack in  the box to round up my look at one of their latest   limited time only chicken sandwiches that's right  you already know it's the spicy cluck sandwich so   stay tuned because it's up next welcome to  peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty so here it is the spicy cluck sandwich at jack in  the box and already we're being greeted by a   shiny yet very fresh-looking toasted brioche bun  guys i'm definitely digging the presentation of   that and it's obviously housing all the good  stuff right there in the middle as you can see   the chicken is peeking out pretty nicely  and it absolutely looks pretty sizable   all right so let's pop the top and take a look  underneath and it looks like we've got a fairly   decent portion of good good sauce along with  three crunchy pickles and i'm definitely down   with that because i absolutely love pickles  and i think that should dovetail nicely into   what it's sitting on guys the spicy breaded  white meat chicken filet and i gotta say again   very sizable looking breaded up and fried to a  crispy golden brown and it's filling out this   brioche pretty nicely in fact it looks oversized  and i'm definitely down with that the appearance   is very awesome on this one underneath it it looks  like we've got more of that good good sauce and   that's actually a very good thing but as you can  see coming back to that chicken again lots of   really tasty looking breaded coating on this one  guys and again a sizeable piece of chicken at that   all right so let's not waste any more time  on this one let's confirm the spicy goodness   hopefully with it it's the spicy cluck sandwich  here at jack-in-the-box let's peep out this flavor   all right so let me start this one off by saying  obviously i've reviewed so many different chicken   sandwiches throughout the year not just a jack  in the box but a lot of other places and you   think i'd be sick of it by now but when they  look as good as this i have to admit i'm even   more excited than ever because like i said  guys the thickness of that fillet and the   overall presentation is looking pretty amazing  the pickle's sticking out on that one as well   very nice and a very fresh-looking toasted brioche  some nice combination of goodies here for sure so   let's not waste any more time we're  finally doing it right now it's the   spicy cluck sandwich here at jack in the box  after hours here at cheater's cam let's do it we're right off the break this is already  feeling like the entry-level version of the   chicken sandwiches here compared to the blazin'  cluck sandwich that i reviewed pretty recently   which you're probably seeing jumping up on the  screen right now obviously it's got spicy in the   tile so it does have a little bit of spice to  it but the overall flavor of the chicken itself   and the breading instantly comes up front with a  little bit of the zip from that good good sauce   and then the heat begins to kind of come through  and it's pretty obvious the heat is definitely in   that spicy chicken fillet because guys it is  really coming through pretty nicely a little   bit of a sizzle but nothing crazy whatsoever  but again a very nice quality piece of white   meat chicken with this one and of course the  crunch the snap and the acidity of that pickle   that i got right there in the beginning as well  really set the tone for this very very tasty but   again nowhere near the heat level compared to the  blazin' variant that i did recently but even still   a very tasty chicken sandwich with a decent amount  of sizzle so let's keep going in it's pretty good you know the fact that the spicy white  meat chicken fillet is juicy on top of   everything else here is really adding to  the overall experience when you combine   that with the good good sauce which is  adding a little bit of sweetness overall   you're getting a very nice chicken  sandwich eating experience with this one   with the heat level that's actually coming  through at the very end as i'm talking right   now my mouth is kind of lit up but at the same  time it's very tolerable but still very tasty   yeah i kind of had an idea going into this review  exactly what to expect from it and so far i'm not   disappointed i'm just so glad that it was made  very well because the juiciness of that chicken   is adding so much to the overall experience like  i said and the fact that it's fried perfectly   and the thickness is pretty good and guys again it  fills out this bun pretty nicely i mean i love the   fact that you can actually see the chicken peeking  out the sides there very very nice overall and   those pickles adding a nice touch i would have  liked maybe just one more but again we've got   three on here so one extra from the typical amount  that you would get on a chicken sandwich elsewhere   is actually not bad so more pickles than merrier  as far as i'm concerned let's keep going in man i am really digging the meat to breading  ratio when it comes to this right now i probably   mentioned i guess it's maybe closer to 70% meat  30% coating and the coating is very heavily spiced   as i'm getting further into it it's still very  tolerable nothing that warrants a special effect   on the screen right now but at the same time it's  noticeable and that's the important thing because   guys it's a spicy cluck sandwich you want it to  be spicy it definitely is all right so here's an   even better cross-section shot now that i'm about  halfway into the sandwich here guys and as you can   see a very lovely situation and again a great  chicken sandwich eating experience tonight with   this one after hours and sometimes it's hit or  miss when you order late night this thankfully   is made to order and you can really tell the  quality is decent with it very nice indeed   all right so let's go for one more bite on this  one because obviously i think you get the point   by now the fact that this was made fresh on  top of it it's delivering on everything it's   selling with this one here and the spiciness is  definitely up there as i'm getting further in   but at the same time you've got the pickles to  go with and that good good sauce adding just the   right amount of zip overall guys pretty tasty  indeed one more bite we'll close it up hang on check it out deja vu another close-up shot i  know you just saw this one just a few seconds   ago but let's just go around the world to close  this one out and as you're going to see again   the close-up of that fried crispy goodness is  a lovely situation with that good good sauce   i really like the name of that i think it's kind  of fun but as you can see guys again the chicken   is filling out this bun nicely and overall again  a very juicy piece of white meat tonight and it   really showcases these cluck sandwiches here at  jack nicely done guys nicely done my new spicy   cluck sandwich with a bigger crispier and better  than ever spicy fillet bigger pickles more sauce   and the perfect amount of spice to get your taste  buds tingling all right so with that said i'm   gonna have to give this new spicy cluck sandwich  here at jack in the box a pretty solid  8.5 out of 10 and the only reason i'm not  gonna go higher than that is because guys the   price point's a little up there at $5.79 granted  it's a pretty sizable sandwich considering the   competition out there at $3.99 maybe a little bit  above that you really shouldn't get much above   $4.49 at the same time now look i get it it's the  west coast prices are typically higher so i guess   the best bet is to go for the combo for like maybe  $8.99 or something like that and get some fries and   a drink but on its own like i said it does deliver  and the quality of the chicken was primo tonight   juicy it had just the right amount of heat and  overall the size like i said really really solid   i just wish it was a little less expensive all a  cart but i see what you're doing jack you want the   combo price i get it all right so for those of  you who've given this one a shot already do me   a quick favor and drop some comments down below  what has your experience been like with this   particular one and did you actually prefer this  one over the blazin variant i'm very curious to   hear what your thoughts are compared to that one  drop some comments down below and definitely let   me know and with
