 what's going on everyone and welcome or welcome  back to the channel where today i'm over at jack   in the box to check out the latest sweet treat  they've got on the menu for a limited time only   that's right and as you already know i'm  hopping aboard the pineapple express so   stay tuned because it's up next welcome to  peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty so here we go guys the pineapple express shake  here at jack in the box and as you're gonna see   a very frosty cup of sweet looking goodness guys  i have to say this is looking very golden and very   very chilly in my hands at the same time all right  so apparently what's in this based upon what i was   told is a pineapple type of flavoring a powder of  some sort that actually is blended with vanilla   soft serve and then topped off with whipped  goodness of course and a cherry guys you gotta   have the cherry on top right so it's definitely  got the right accent on top of that nice yellow   color guys and on a cold day here in southern  cali right now this is very frosty in my hands   yes sir as it begins to melt down that little  cherry is beginning to make its way down to the   bottom of this but as you can see very cool  looking in terms of the accent on this guys   and again a very chilly day here in southern  cali so without further ado let's knock this   one out right now it's the all new pineapple  express shake here jack in the box let's do it mmm super thick but super rich wow crazy sweetness  very heavy on that vanilla and the pineapple   together it's a pretty nice combo so far mmm  i can barely get this up the straw guys so as   you can see the coloring it's pretty nice on this  plenty of the whipped cream goodness on the very   top let me go for that just a little bit here look  how thick this is the straw is lit up with this   goodness guys this is really nice mmm super rich  super vibrant and as this cherry begins to go down i might as well take this down really quick  guys as you can see let's give it a shot hang on mmm absolutely nice accent let's keep going i can barely get this thing up it is very very  strong in the thickness department hang on it goes good with that cherry though really nice  so yeah the sweetness is definitely up there guys   and considering the size that i've got here right  now this is more than enough this is actually a   regular for $4.29 the large is $4.79 out here but  this is all you really need very very cool in   terms of what this is actually offering over  here at jack and i got to be honest the first   time i saw this i immediately thought of pineapple  express the movie with seth rogen and james franco   but on the real the backup thought was actually  the porkchop express and if you know exactly   where that's from the big huge huge freightliner  that was driven by jack burton in a very popular   1986 movie drop those comments down below let me  know which movie that is it's actually one of my   all-time favorites so jack if you're watching  this i think you're missing the boat slightly   by pairing this up with a pork chop express type  of entree to go with the pineapple express i think   it's a pretty nice combo but as it stands for  the shake it is very very sweet but the flavoring   is pretty nice i'm not getting really dole whip  vibes from this it's more like the artificial   pineapple type of flavoring but even still it  really is very very strong along with the vanilla   goodness from that soft serve that it's mixed with  and naturally with the whipped topping on the very   top here guys you can't fade that pretty nice  all right so let's go for a couple more sips on   this one guys because the right side of my face  is beginning to freak out it's very very sweet   but the pineapple is pretty good powder or not i  thought it was maybe like a syrup of some type i   guess it still gives you the color either way very  very cool and naturally this actually looks very   cool up on the poster in front of the restaurant  as well too so another couple of sips hang on i can barely get this up to the straw but it's  super flavorful what i am getting actually wow that is crazy order on ubereats postmates and  grubhub alright i think i'm good with this right   now very tasty a very cool sweet treat over here  jack to go with and naturally again i think that   should pair up nicely with just about anything on  their menu on its own very very sweet but like i   said guys you'd expect that the powder that's  mixed in with that is very very strong in the   pineapple department so it really is a pineapple  express because i am running all over the place   it feels like right now because the sugar level is  crazy but at the same time i'm digging what i've   got here price point decent at $4.29 but like i said  that's all you really need just get the regular   all right so with all that said i'm gonna have to  give the pineapple shake over here jack in the box   a pretty decent 7 out of 10 i'm not gonna go  much higher than that and i'm definitely not gonna   be getting this one again because although  i do love dole whip this is kind of giving   me little shades of pineapple goodness in the  background in terms of what that is but this is   very strong in that vanilla soft serve department  with the pineapple goodness coming up but overall   very very sweet and again one last time you gotta  love the whipped topping on the very top of this   here along with that little maraschino cherry  very very lovely situation you gotta have one   of those it really looks great on the poster  and guys super fun to check out either way   all right so do me a quick favor for all of you  peeps that have jack in the box in the area if   you do give this one a shot which i'd recommend  trying it at least once and if you've actually   had the dole whip float in the past anywhere  else where they may serve something like that   how do you think this actually compares to that  drop those comments down below and definitely   let me know and with that this is Ian K closing  out another high quality foodie feature for you   here on peep this out reviews bringing you brand  new content every single week here on my channel   so while you stay tuned for that next review coming  real soon in the meantime stay frosty yup sugar   overload on this one but you'd expect that and  considering the flavor is definitely delivering   that pineapple goodness on top of the vanilla  goodness that this is mixed with guys a very   lovely situation especially again with that cherry  on top along with the whipped cream pretty awesome   all right guys until next time i'll talk to you  soon hey thanks for checking out another one of   my reviews but just in case you didn't see the one  before this one you can find it right up over here   along what i think youtube's gonna recommend  for you to check out as well as always i think
