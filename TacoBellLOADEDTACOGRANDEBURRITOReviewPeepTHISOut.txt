because it's up next welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty all right so let's see if we can strike some gold with the loaded taco Grande burrito here at Taco Bell and as you can see this is actually looking pretty decent guys the filling on this one does appear to be a little bit more substantial at least compared to the Chipotle chicken that I checked out recently what we've got here is the standard warm tortilla filled with their seasoned ground beef we've got some cheese some lettuce some red strips for crunch and some reduced fat sour cream and I got to say this doesn't look half bad in the size Department it is still on the small side but it does feel a little bit more hefty on the inside so I am cool with that let's see if the flavors gonna deliver on this one it's the loaded taco Grande burrito here at Taco Bell let's peep out this flavor value beyond belief alright so yeah this one infinitely feels like it's starting off better alrighty guys so before I confirm what I think is gonna be a pretty tasty grande burrito for you and like always if you guys are fans of high quality delicious looking food of use make sure to hit the subscribe button down below and don't forget to tap the bell icon to be notified as soon as brand new content drops every week guys the loaded taco Grande burrito not necessarily grande in size but it's definitely got some heft here we go mmm instantly better a lot of filling in that a lot of sour cream in that first bite as well the crunch of those tortilla strips that's a lovely situation and I'm really diggin how that sour cream is mixing with the lettuce believe it or not so you're getting the nice crunch most tortilla strips in there as well as all the beefy goodness that you know from Taco Bell this is pretty much the quintessential flavor of Taco Bell all inside this burrito here and I am really digging the crunch like I said of everything in it hey it's essentially a taco supreme crushed up without the tomatoes and then thrown inside of a tortilla how bad could that really be right guys let's go for another bite mmm it's so much more satisfying overall and I am definitely a fan of that reduced fat sour cream mixing with those tortilla strips guys that is just a lovely situation the saltiness that I'm getting the creaminess the sourness from it as well and then when you mix that with the beef that a lovely situation this is just really really tasty I'm so glad I technically saved the best for last because this definitely is the best out of the group out of the two anyway so size-wise it's not bad for a dollar considering the size of the last one that I got the Chipotle chicken make sure you guys take a look at that review popping up on your screen right now for the evidence of that one that was tasty and flavor but not necessarily in what I got actually this is a lot closer to what I was expecting at least it's a little bit bigger overall and the quality is classic Taco Bell like I said the quintessential flavor of Taco Bell on the inside of a tortilla pretty tasty stuff so let me go for one more bite of this one I'll give you a fast close up of the other half and then we'll wrap this one up after the rating but guys so far this one is easily worth the buck easily now even though this one lacks the avocado ranch sauce from the original version of it you're not gonna miss it too much considering the amount of sour cream in this one guys so if you wanted to add that ala carte to this you can but overall what you've got here is those classic Taco Bell flavors all in the inside of a nice warm tortilla easily worth the buck like I said and easily worth your time this is pretty tasty so with that said I'm gonna have to give the loaded taco Grande burrito here at Taco Bell a rock-solid 9 out of 10 the only way that I can see to improve this one is to add the avocado ranch back into it and make it part of the actual burrito but being that you can actually add that ala carte it's not necessarily a bad thing the size is pretty decent again your mileage may vary depending upon where you get them but naturally this is the best experience I've had so far at least of the more recent Taco Bell reviews that I've done so far now the obvious question at least from me to you anyway is did this loaded Grande burrito looked like it was worth a buck drop those comments down below what did you think of the overall presentation of this one and personally have you tried it already drop those comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K closing out another episode of peep this out bringing you brand new content every single week here on my channel so while you stay tuned for that next of you coming real soon in the
