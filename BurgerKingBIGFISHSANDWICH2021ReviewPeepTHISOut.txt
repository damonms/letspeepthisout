 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty hey everyone welcome back to another high quality  foodie feature for you here on the channel where   this time i'm back on over a bk to scratch another  one off that old food review bucket list with an   item that just happens to be perfect for the  season of lent so without further ado let's get   into it guys feast your eyes on the big fish here  at bk and already guys this is not a bad looking   fish sandwich actually here it looks like that  little square pollock fillet is really fitting   this bun pretty nicely so let's start off top to  bottom with this one with that toasted brioche   style bun looking nice and fresh and when we pop  it you're gonna see it's got a little dollop of   tartar sauce holding together some of that  shredded lettuce admittedly not my favorite   type of lettuce and as we pan down there's  that panko breaded 100% white alaskan pollock   filet right there guys coated very nicely topped  off with a couple of pickles and a few little   stragglers of that lettuce action right there  but not too bad there as well and underneath it   some more of that tartar sauce action but guys  like i said this is a pretty nice looking sandwich   but admittedly the price point does have me a  little concerned on this one considering this   was a little over six dollars after tax about  $5.69 or so so hopefully it's going to deliver   on flavor because like i said it's a pretty  nice looking fish sandwich actually so let's   peep this out guys it's the big fish my first  time trying this over here at bk let's do it that's not bad already and admittedly  where most of the flavor is coming from   is actually from the tartar sauce  which is a little on the sweet side   and the pickles believe it or not the  pickles are really adding to this overall   and then you go into the nice flakiness  of that pollock fillet which admittedly   again is not too bad in terms of the size it is  covering this little brioche bun pretty nicely   and fairly flaky guys just a little on the thin  side but man so far i'm kind of impressed not bad yeah yeah this definitely feels like a freshly  made fish sandwich guys everything is nice and   warm on the inside there it doesn't feel like  it's been sitting at all it really does feel   nice and flaky on the pollock too there  i'm really digging that and those panko   bread crumbs they really make a difference with  fish and i really see why a few places use it   it's definitely a nice flavor situation for sure  guys but again the price point is really what's   hanging in the back of my head with this one  it's just a little on the pricey side overall   and that's really kind of a shame because i  think this would do much better as like say   a two for five or something like that because  at $2.50 i think it's kind of worth it and when   you consider the size of this here guys  it really is a little on the small side   so anything over $3.99 believe it or not is gonna be  a stretch for this so at $5.69 here in southern cali   it's asking a little much for what this is  but considering what i'm getting flavor-wise   right now and the fact that this is made pretty  nicely there that's kind of elevating it slightly   but again it's a little on the expensive  side let's go for another bite on this one yeah definitely a good call with the pickles on  this guys i probably could have used maybe one   or two more on here because that pickle juice is  elevating the panko bread crumbs and the overall   flavor so nicely with this on top of the tartar  sauce which is fairly plentiful it's more on the   bottom but guys very very delicious on this one  i'm glad i checked this one out i'm only sorry i   waited this long to do it but this is the time to  do it because it is the season of lent after all   all right so let's go for one more bite in this  one and we'll close this one up after the rating   guys but again another fast food fish sandwich  that i never thought i'd be seeing myself trying   actually because i've never really been a fan  of fast food fish but when it's made as decent   as this is i can probably get into it once in  a while one more bite we'll finish this one up well panko bread crumbs and pickles are absolutely  the secret weapon with this one guys i am really   digging this one here it really deserves to be  a little bit bigger i think with a name called   big fish you really want to have it just a little  bit larger overall especially for the price point   like i keep coming back to but what is here is  pretty flavorful even if it's a little on the   more expensive side and again i'm really digging  that combination of the tartar sauce and the   pickles with this one along with that panko it's  elevating this one up very very nicely not bad   for a fast food fish sandwich and i never thought  i'd hear myself say that so jumping right to the   rating i'm gonna have to give the big fish here  at bk my first time giving this one a go a pretty   decent 7.5 out of 10 and guys that's  about as high as i want to take this one because   like i said it's more of a premium to give this  one a shot and like i said in terms of the season   right now you think you'd want to see like a  two for five or something to really push this   it really kind of warrants that but what you're  gonna get flavor-wise is pretty solid like i said   the pickles themselves along with the panko is  a beautiful situation along with the tartar just   the right amount of sweetness on that and it has  some pretty nice flavor overall thanks to the 100%   white alaskan pollock on this one so guys a very  very solid fast food fish sandwich and like i said   i never thought i'd hear myself say that pretty  decent all right question time for all you fast   food fish lovers out there and i'd venture to  guess that's virtually everyone who's made it   this far into the review where is your personal  go-to
