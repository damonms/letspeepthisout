 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty alright everyone let's get it it's Ian K back  again with another high quality foodie feature   for you here on peep this out reviews this time  over at papa john's because not only is the fan   favorite double cheeseburger back on the menu  this time around it's got an awesome looking   papadia variant to go with so let's go in on the  double cheeseburger papadia and as always we've   got a nicely toasted folded situation right here  guys i'm really digging that folded over pizza   crust it's looking really nice and toasty let's  take a look on the inside and as expected all   the goodies from the double cheeseburger pizza  are visible we've got a combination of beef   zesty burger sauce pickles tomatoes and mozzarella  and i gotta say it is looking very very nice but   the biggest standout amongst all those ingredients  is the pickles i'm super excited to give this a   shot because that makes it really authentic and  because you can never have too much zesty burger   sauce we've got a nice little side of it here  for our dipping pleasure can't wait to get into   that as well and just because i'm curious let's  take a look at the other half here really quick   and as usual lots of the same goodness on the  other side i can't wait to give this a shot guys   this is looking really really good so there you go  it's the little brother to the double cheeseburger   pizza it's the all new double cheeseburger papadia here at papa john's let's peep out this flavor   so yeah guys i'm not even gonna front right now  if you've got anything resembling a cheeseburger   in terms of name only or just what you're trying  to do with it if it does not have pickles you're   already losing points because it's not super  authentic you've got to have pickles and guys   this actually does and i am really digging the  presentation not only does that green add some   authenticity to the look of this one it overall  is gonna add that flavor that i'm expecting from   that double cheeseburger pizza which if you guys  haven't seen that review that i did a couple of   years ago it should be popping up on your screen  here right now definitely give that one a shot   because it was pretty glorious so with this  i can't wait to get into it but like always   before we do if you guys are fans of high quality  delicious looking food reviews make sure to hit   that subscribe button down below and don't forget  to tap that bell icon so you can be notified   as soon as brand new content drops every week  guys here we go the double cheeseburger papadia   simulating the buns top and bottom there with  the goodness on the middle let's give it a shot oh my god instant pickles oh cheese  the beef that zesty burger sauce oh man   this is an explosion in my  mouth right now this is insane   hands down the right amount of saltiness the  acidity to snap the crunch of the pickles and   everything else with us right now a lovely  situation here guys just look at that that   is super authentic the pickles are nice and thick  they're definitely cut very well and the cheese and   the beefy goodness is amazing on the inside of  this there i'm not really tasting any tomatoes   but the cheese i gotta say is a beautiful blend  of that really rich mozzarella over here it's a   lovely situation with this and guys of course the  toastiness on the outside of the crust beautiful   situation let's go for another bite we'll give  you some more close-ups this is pretty banging the snap and the tartness of those pickles  are awesome with this and of course when   you combine that with that zesty burger sauce  which really feels like a little bit more of a   muted mac sauce it really is a lovely situation  decent amount of beef on the inside as well and   all the cheesy goodness to go with but guys just  a lovely combination of what was from the pizza   in papadia form and as you can see there is no  shortage of deliciousness in front of you here   right now this is pretty awesome you know i gotta  say as i'm getting further into this i can't help   but think about that recent cheeseburger pizza  that i reviewed from the other guys recently   domino's as good as that was believe me and it was this actually adds another layer of authenticity   because of the pickle situation and i think  i mentioned it in that review as well   you got to have pickles on a cheeseburger pizza  and with this one being as good as it is from what   it was from the pizza version that i did i got to  admit i'm really enjoying it in what's considered   a part pizza part sandwich situation here and  i'm really digging the fact that the actual   crust itself is simulating what the buns would  be on a cheeseburger but with the ingredients on   the inside so one more bite then we're going to  definitely get into some of this quote-unquote   zesty burger sauce A.K.A mac sauce whatever you want to call it it looks very similar let's go in alright one more quick look at this one before  we go for that dip because you can never get too   many tasty looking shots of this guys this is  actually really good and when it comes to the   zesty burger sauce yeah it actually kind of  smells like mac sauce believe it or not and   judging by the look of it there you tell me  it isn't looking like you're thinking what   it is right now it really does feel like it  here we go let's go for that dip there you go   nice little shot of it there coated up  nicely on that bite let's give it a go overload of it wow vibrant oh man this is insane  it's got almost like a very familiar thousand   islandy type of flavor to it on top of a little  bit of pickled relish believe it or not i'm   getting a lot of different flavors with it but  it's very rich a little bit of sweetness but man   you know what let's go for another dip on  that because that actually was really good   really really good let's go for  another overloaded piece of it   there man this is just awesome  right now really really awesome man such a good call having it on the side  you know i gotta say as i was watching this   being prepared and when it came out of the oven  i thought the amount that they swirled onto it   afterwards there before they folded it over was  going to be enough but considering the amount   that they give you and what it actually adds  to the party when you actually add more of it   let me just say it's a good call you're  going to want to seriously go for that dip   and let's go for one more here just  with that crust to give this a shot   because i really want to try it with the  toastiness there but as you can see it's   very thick and just an overall beautiful  situation here guys one more bite hang on all around man this is so good actually it's  beyond so good it's pretty insane and i think   you know where i'm going with this rating wise  when we get to that point of the review right   now so i'm going to go for one more bite of this  one before we close this one out after the rating   but guys a lovely situation and overall just great  great stuff here especially with that zesty burger   sauce as you can see really really good here we  go all right so for the final shot let me show you   the other half of this one and as always guys a  delicious blend of the good stuff from that double   cheeseburger pizza the zesty burger sauce is on  point the beef the cheese everything in this one   but it's the pickles that really take this to new  levels and i gotta say it's a beautiful situation   having it in this part sandwich form is a lovely  thing highly recommended on this but i think   you knew that already right better ingredients  better pizza better than a sandwich papa john's   yeah they're definitely not playing with this one  over here right now and considering how beloved   the double cheeseburger pizza is over here at papa  john's i absolutely loved it a couple of years   ago and i'm so glad that it's back on the menu  but to have a papadia variant of it like this   let me just say a beautiful situation guys so  for the obvious rating i'm gonna have to give   the double cheeseburger papadia here at papa  john's the awesome 10 out of 10 and what really   makes this one for me is the side of that  zesty burger sauce but more often than not   the pickles and i think you know that already  guys i'm telling you the acidity the snap and   the crunch what it adds the tartness the blend of  everything together with that zesty burger sauce   is amazing along with the light saltiness of the  cheese and of course the beef the nice toastiness   of the outer crust guys i can go on and on with  this one here just go get it this really feels   like a cheeseburger hybrid done right and i gotta  say the pickles and that zesty burger sauce easily   take this one in new heights easily alright so  i'm not even gonna ask you if you're gonna give   this one a shot because i think most if not all  of you definitely are what i am gonna ask you is   what are your thoughts of pickles on things like  this do you need to have the actual ingredients   of a cheeseburger in these cheeseburger hybrids  drop some comments down below and let me know   what some of your thoughts are on that as well as  some of your favorite cheeseburger
