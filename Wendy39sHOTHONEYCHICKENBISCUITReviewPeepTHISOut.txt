 well good morning everyone and welcome or welcome  back to the channel it's Ian K where today i'm   over at wendy's to go in on what looks to be a  little sweet sweet heat for breakfast that's right   and you already know what it is so stay tuned  because the hot honey chicken biscuit is up next   welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty all right right off the top let me get this one  started by saying that while i've definitely   said in the past i am not a morning person by  any means i mean any breakfast review that i've   done i've pretty much always reiterated that  this is actually trying its very best right   now to put a smile on my face because i got to  say guys the aroma of butter in my car right now   is very strong yeah this biscuit has definitely  got some buttery action and while i definitely   appreciate that it's what's on the inside of this  one that i really want to get into so without   further ado let's do just that guys it's the hot  honey chicken biscuit here at wendy's and i gotta   say this is looking really nice in that chicken  department nice and thick nice and plump let's   get into this one and break it on down all right  so very simply what we've got here is a very fresh   looking and very aromatic in the butter department  buttermilk biscuit and on the inside of this one a   crispy white meat chicken filet and as you can see  it's breaded up and fried to a crispy golden brown   it seems to be drizzled with plenty of that hot  honey sauce right there soaking right into it and   i gotta say it is looking very very nice nothing  on the very bottom of this one but at the same   time i'm hoping to get a little bit of that buttery  action infused with the habanero peppers of the   hot honey sauce itself to go with this chicken  but overall this combination looks pretty nice   yeah and considering this is my first time i  think i'm going in on the buttermilk biscuit   over here at wendy's this is definitely  going to be a first for me on top of that   so on top of the hot honey sauce we've got  the buttermilk biscuit action to go in and   again it is feeling and looking very fresh and  i am definitely digging the aromatic goodness   of the butter on this one so guys without  further ado one more time let's do it again   it's the hot honey chicken biscuit  early in the AM from wendy's let's do it mmm sweetness butteriness mmm little bit of heat  coming in that's pretty tasty yeah just as i had   hoped the butteriness is shining through on this  biscuit guys let me just show this to you on the   inside it is very very aromatic in that butter  department as i've said but the butteriness is on   point and it dovetails right into the crispiness  of the chicken the chicken's a little on the   dry side but that's where the actual moisture  from that hot honey sauce comes in and again   the infusion of a little bit of sweetness and  definitely a little bit of sizzle on this one it's   nothing crazy but the flavor is very nice and it  complements the butteriness of that biscuit pretty   nice on this one so far yeah this definitely  feels quality made guys and considering in the   past i've done the breakfast baconator over here  at wendy's i guess i would expect nothing less   than that similar quality with something like this  and while the ingredients list is very simple on   it what you're getting is a fairly crispy piece  of chicken to go with their signature hot honey   sauce which is the main promo over here so  when you combine that with that tastiness   of the biscuit you've got a pretty nice flavor  combination let's keep going in it's not bad i like the fact that it's not crumbly and falling  apart either that's really good you know just   thinking back as i'm going further into this one i  believe i checked out the chicken biscuit from BK   a while back this absolutely smokes it in terms  of flavor and just the overall everything that   i'm getting with this one now granted this does  have the signature hot honey sauce to go with   so that infusion of a little bit of sizzle and  the sweetness is really elevating this one but   what really does it for me on top of that is just  the overall flavor of the biscuit because that's   the whole transportation mechanism to get this  into your face so to speak so when you combine   the flavor of the biscuit with the quality  made piece of chicken on this one and again   the crispiness is on point with it guys i mean  just to kind of show you the back of it here   it's nicely breaded there's a nice  coating to meat ratio in this one   and overall it just works really really  nice so let's go for another couple on   this one guys this is actually really tasty  and i don't mind being up super early in   the morning to do this right now because the  quality is shining through let's keep going in   i like it here's a nice cross-section shot again  of everything this one has got to offer and again   very simple on the ingredients list on this  one guys but you're getting a very plump piece   of chicken i have to say well it's a little on  the dry side just a little bit like i said the   moisture of that hot honey sauce is really doing  its job with this one the fact that it's on a very   buttery biscuit that's not crumbly and falling  apart really says a lot the quality is very nice   overall on this you know if there's one small  knock against this one aside from the fact that   the chicken itself is a little on the dry side  and naturally i'm glad the hot honey sauce is   on here to kind of give you that moisture it's the  fact that it's $3.50 for a very small little biscuit   sandwich so i know it's west coast where i live  right now southern cali you tend to pay a little   bit more of a premium but at almost four dollars  for something kind of small like this probably   maybe $2.99 tops i got to be honest guys i mean come  on really but still what you're getting here is a   very flavorful situation and i'm definitely glad  to have checked this one out and again one of the   cool things about this is the fact that as i'm  getting further in this biscuit is not falling   apart that's one of my major gripes with all the  other things that i've done in the past which is   some of the biscuit options that say BK or Carl's  Jr this actually is holding its own composure-wise   and i'm really digging that so you have the  form you have the flavor a little bit of heat a   little bit of sizzle a little bit of sweetness i'm  definitely digging the overall quality like i said   it's not bad all right so let's go for one more  bite of this one before we wrap the review up with   the rating coming up next but guys a very quality  outing over here at wendy's and thankfully like i   said earlier this is definitely trying its best  to put a smile on my face and i think it is all   throughout this review this is still pretty tasty  one more bite we'll close it out soon hang on well nice job with the buttermilk recipe you've  got on this one wendy's it's really holding its   own in that composure department and staying  together fairly nicely it's buttery it's crispy   and on the inside you have another equally crispy  piece of chicken to go with along with that hot   honey sauce a very lovely situation as we continue  to go 360 around this one i gotta say very nice   overall i just wish it was a little bit bigger  for the money but what you're getting here is   a very quality made breakfast biscuit sandwich  with some signature hot honey sauce to go with   very nicely done overall so with that said i'm  gonna have to give the hot honey chicken biscuit   here at wendy's a pretty solid 9 out of 10  i gotta say minor gripes aside with the chicken   not being as juicy as it could have been and the  price point being a little up there what you're   getting is a quality made chicken sandwich and i  gotta say for breakfast that does a pretty good   job guys i have to say the biscuit quality is very  high like i've said all throughout the review and   the quality of the chicken overall with that hot  honey sauce is very flavorful now a little does go   a long way when it comes to that hot honey sauce  i mean you could get a little extra on the side if   you wanted to add more to it but like i said less  is more technically and with the flavor of that   being very rich very sweet the heat is actually  i think perfect for what you're getting with that   one and you can taste everything very nicely so  the combination of the sauce the crispiness of   the chicken the flavor of the chicken and the  butteriness of that biscuit very well made again   i might add definitely goes a long way to pretty  much solidify this as being a very solid breakfast   option and what i would highly recommend it's  pretty good all right so do me a quick favor drop   some comments down below let me know if you're  going to give this one a shot and if you're not   a morning person like i am does this actually  entice you to want to run it over to wendy's to   give it a go drop some comments down below and
