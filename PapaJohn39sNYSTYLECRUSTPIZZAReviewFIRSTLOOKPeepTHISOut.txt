 what's going on everyone and welcome back to  another high quality foodie feature for you   here on the channel where this time i'm over  at papa john's because it looks like they're   going back east for a little inspiration on  their latest upcoming promo yes sir and this   one definitely looks right up my alley and  of course i'll explain so stay tuned because   their new york style crust is up next welcome  to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty so here we go with the large 16 inch one topping  new york style crust pizza from papa john's and   already guys this is looking absolutely delicious  right now lots of goodness in my car in the aroma   department and the presentation is definitely  banging on this one i can't wait to get into this   all right but first things first i got to break  it down for you so what you're looking at here   is my topping of choice we've got their sausage  which i absolutely love it's kind of like a cross   between breakfast sausage and regular sausage  and it's just got a really nice flavor to it   so i definitely wanted to go in on that and of  course what that's sitting on is their regular   pizza ingredients we've got that classic marinara  and the cheese goodness right there but guys the   new york style crust think of it as a cross  between thin crust and regular pizza crust   but it's definitely larger and more foldable and  i gotta say this is looking and smelling great   i'm telling you i can't wait to get into this  all right Ian patience patience we'll get into   it but as you can see the garlic dipping sauce  of choice is definitely what comes with these   pizzas over here at papa john's it's definitely an  awesome situation i can't wait to do that as well   so obviously you can see i'm pretty excited  about this one because like i said guys aside   from the presentation the aroma is absolutely  awesome so let's not waste any more time finally   this is the one topping new york style crust  pizza from papa john's let's peep out this flavor   yes sir 16 inches of new york style crust pizza  action in your face right now guys i can barely   fit this in the frame this box is pretty huge  right now and the aroma like i said is crazy   i cannot wait to do this i know i keep saying  it ad nauseum but it looks and smells fantastic   let me pull one of these pieces up here and as  you guys can see wow this is smelling amazing   take a look at that there guys we got some crazy  sausage action but it's that new york style crust   the large foldable floppable pieces and as you  can see it looks pretty authentic for conveyor   belt pizza guys look at that on the bottom the  dusting looks great let's give this a shot guys   the one topping and in this case sausage over here  at papa john's new york style crust let's do it pizza so good well like i said this one's  definitely right up my alley because i'm   originally from new york and as a kid i remember  going to pizzerias with my grandparents and my   parents naturally and this has already taken  me back because of the size of the slices   a very lovely situation here guys as you can  see again that dusting on my fingers on the   bottom is taking me back to it and that cross  between thin crust and regular pizza crust is   definitely noticeable and of course the largest  size is taking this one up a few notches as   well and of course i got this one with my  favorite topping over here at papa john's   they're italian sausage which again really kind  of feels like a cross between breakfast sausage   and regular sausage it's like right in the  middle in terms of flavor and it's definitely   unique compared to all the other chains but guys  delicious stuff let's keep going in really tasty how could it not be it's hot pizza   well as many of you already know pizza is my  all-time favorite comfort food i absolutely love   it and i can have it pretty much at any time but  having this actually on a gloomy day right now on   a very cold day at that is only heightening  this one that much further guys and as you   can see again lots of cheesy goodness it's like  classic papa john's flavor but the fact that you   have large foldable slices here with that dusting  on the bottom it's got that authenticity of that   new york style if you ask me and i have to say  i'm really digging the overall quality of this   one in general pretty banging all right so i'm  definitely going for another bite on this one   before i get into what's coming up next and i  think you know what that is hang on one second super tasty stuff and i'm so digging the wide cut  on this guys i love holding it right there in the   middle and giving it that slight bend real fast  but tasty tasty tasty and like i said it's papa   john's pizza on a very cold dreary day right now  on top of it very good but as tasty as this is   and i already alluded to it about a minute or  so ago guys feast your eyes on it we're going   into it right now the papa john's special garlic  dipping sauce the signature of course and you know   we're getting down with it let's hit it yes sir  i love me some garlic dipping sauce over here   at papa john's very delicious i can already smell  that margarine garlic goodness already there   take a look at that as you can see that is pure  heaven on the inside of this container right now   and of course we're gonna go for  the dip so let me do this for you   yes yes yes we'll get that  nicely coated a nice little dip   look at that action here we go new york  style on the crust with it let's do it man come on i am in such  heaven right now with this   i mean i know it's just the standard papa john's  pizza which is tasty anyway but the fact that it's   on this type of style of crust that i'm used to as  a kid that's actually a very cool situation again   not quite thin crust not quite thick either right  in between and it really is pretty nice and the   fact that it's foldable i think i'm gonna go for  that in the next bite or the last bite actually i   should say because i should actually role play it  right let's just go for one more bite real quick all right so let's fold this  one up and give this a shot   yeah we're gonna double it up look at  that action delicious stuff all around i   hope that's staying in focus as you can see  buttery goodness garlic goodness all around   let's go for a second to the last bite i should  say i'm just digging this right now hang on yes sir the classic papa john's flavor  spread across a 16-inch new york style   crust guys you can't fade that for  13 bucks is a one topping not bad   whatsoever very satisfying and of course  when you've got this action to go with   you already know guys delicious stuff all  around very tasty let's go for one last bite so there you go guys let me try and keep this new  york slice in frame for you and as you can see   cut very nicely and i got to say again a nice  combination of the goodness in terms of the   toppings of course your mileage may vary depending  upon your favorite topping of choice with this one   but as you can see for me sausage definitely ranks  up there and of course the very bottom of this one   it's got that new york vibe i got to tell you  guys because of the cut and the fact that that   thickness is right in between those two sizes  thin crust and standard but on the real just   some seriously delicious papa john's goodness new  york style but of course that equally delicious   dipping sauce the garlic action very very lovely  yeah i sure missed those days as a kid hitting up   the pizzerias with my family getting actually an  individual slice on a piece of wax paper on top of   those metal pizza trays those were really really  awesome back then it was so distinct so different   and we just don't have that nowadays naturally  but i have to say that kind of reminds me of that   failing because of the quality of it and like i  said with the new york style crust being right in   between thin crust and regular and the fact that  they're cut large it's kind of taken me back just   a little bit so pretty tasty guys definitely fun  to check out so with that said i'm going to have   to give the all-new new york style crust over  here at papa john's a pretty rock solid  9 out of 10 guys this one has nostalgia all over it for  me right now and i got to say the overall quality   of papa john's in general is always pretty tasty  whenever i review it add in that special garlic   dipping sauce you already know what it is and  you've got a lovely combination so something   to definitely check out and at 13 bucks for a  one topping it's not bad again the slices are   cut nice and large so you've got your choice  to eat it open-faced or in that folded style   but either way guys very delicious stuff i would  highly recommend checking this one out all right   so now the all-important question because i have a  feeling if
