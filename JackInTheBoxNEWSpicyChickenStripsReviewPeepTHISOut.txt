their all-new spicy chicken strips combo and for $4.99 and this is not a bad looking deal starting off with a small order of their hot and salty fries looking fairly crispy we've got a small drink right behind it there I upped it to go for Diet Coke and that accompanies the star of the show guys take a look at this very threatening looking three piece order of the spicy chicken strips hand breaded in panko and cracker crumbs and seasoned with a very decent amount of spicing it looks like guys I don't know if that red is coming through but it looks very very red right there in the middle very fried looking 100% white meat chicken guys these are actually really nicely sized you pull this up here a little bit closer so you can take a closer look to examine it very heavy and a lot of breading and the smell definitely smells fried guys it really really looks and smells great so definitely pretty awesome in the size department considering it's about even across the board for all three of these pieces here guys looking pretty satisfying already they're for dipping we got to go with ranch the buttermilk house sauce aka the ranch it's absolutely my go-to here delicious stuff so let's see if this actually delivers on that deliciously heated promise guys it's the spicy chicken strip combo here at jack-in-the-box let's peep out this flavor so are you a fan of high-quality

let's dive into this one white meat chicken deep-fried in panko and cracker crumbs along with the signature blend of spices how bad could this really be here we go whoa well I was initially on the fence with this one after that first bite because I really wasn't tasting anything above and beyond a standard fry type of coating but now the heat is beginning to pick up and wow that is oh that's actually coming up a little bit stronger hang on mmm man that is nuts and guys I'm gonna show you this close-up right now but there is like a ring of redness around the inside of this on the outside of the meat under the coating but man that is pretty tasty guys you know what let me give you that close-up right now man let me just get my mouth some time to cool down after that bite I really wasn't thinking this was gonna be as hot as it turned out to be after that first bite but it really does creep up on you take a look right there around the white meat and you're gonna see some redness I'm definitely seeing it in my viewfinder right now but guys a very very nice fried outer coating as you guys can see it's very deep it looks a little over fried but it doesn't taste over fried but man that ring of fire guys right outside of the white meat underneath the coating is pretty extreme so I'm glad I got some ranch sauce let's get into that one actually you know what before we go for a dip in that ranch let me go for one more bite to see if that heat is just as strong the second time around let's go for it yeah it is Wow man guys that is like an easy 8 out of 10 in terms of spice mmm it doesn't detract from the flavor of this panko and the crumb coating that it's got here and the white meat is fairly juicier as I'm getting into it the end pieces were a little bit on the drier side so it's better as I'm getting further in a little bit thicker but wow that heat is really nice very tasty and it's still beginning to kick on me right now so let's go for a dip into this ranch guys because I think I made it yeah this is absolutely spicier than anything I've had recently from Popeyes KFC or church's I think the guy for the drive-thru was onto something when he said it really was better than the other guys let's see if this one cools it down and actually right now I'm really hoping it does cool it down because my mouth is on fire guys literally mmm well it does but not as much it's really fighting with the ranch right now guys this is pretty strong spicing on this I am very surprised this really does look threatening it tastes threatening it is threatening but the meat itself is really good on the inside just a little bit drier towards the ends that's the only thing but Wow tasty with the coating and guys again this is just gonna hang with me I think this whole review right now this is gonna be hard to finish let's just keep going we'll do the best we can here man this is probably the most difficult jack review I have done on camera yet man that is very strong and here I thought my tolerance for spice was going up not only is it like 80 degrees outside it feels like it's a 100 degrees in my car right now because of this I'm sweating like crazy right now let me finish this one out I'll give you another close-up of one more of these and we gotta end this one quick I'm telling you this is really strong no joke on these spicy chicken strips here at jack guys they really do deliver on the promise of being spicy and while chicken strips are easily one of my favorite types of finger foods I'm easily going to be getting this one again just take one more look at the coating on this it is really very tasty and as you can see fried up to perfection if you look closely you may be able to see some of that marinade peeking through a little bit and I'm very happy to report that it's even across the board on the inside that ring of fire is coated very nicely along with the signature blend of spices this one has very much a highlight checking these out today aside from the weather that I'm doing it and of course man I almost wish I didn't says the cheaters camera review at night because that easily set me off right now in a sweat department guys it is really really insanely hot to me right now my mouth is still buzzing with excitement because of the flavor on top of it as well as the spice is a very cool signature blend they're using here so with that said I'm gonna have to give the spicy chicken strips here a jack-in-the-box a rock-solid 10 out of 10 and how could I not considering everything you just saw right now everything you just heard but if I can make one recommendation get just a couple of more extra ranch's just to be on the safe side because depending upon your tolerance for heat these are definitely elevated way above normal in my opinion so aside from that and aside from also the fact that the chicken was just a little bit drier on the sides the middle was very juicy and overall a very pleasurable experience checking this one out and guys you can't beat a small fry and a drink along with that for $4.99 so the average price point for most of the national fast-food chains out there and this was easily something I would get again pretty tasty try my 100% all white meat spicy chicken strips combo today only at jack-in-the-box okay now the obvious question is did this look tasty to you drop some comments down below are you guys a fan of very spicy chicken strips and if you are are you gonna be giving this one a shot if you have a jack in the area drop those comments down below and definitely
