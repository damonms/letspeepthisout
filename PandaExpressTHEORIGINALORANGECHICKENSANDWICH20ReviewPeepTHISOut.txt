 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K  stay frosty what's going on everyone and   welcome to the channel where today I ventured  on over to the Panda Express Innovation Kitchen   in Pasadena California because it looks like  they're testing a brand new version of their   orange chicken sandwich which at this point  should hopefully be going National pretty   soon guys this is the second time but I  gotta admit it looks a little bit better   we're gonna break this one on down first and  definitely get into it it looks pretty awesome   all right so this time around it looks like we've  got a nicely toasted brioche bun and once we pop   it underneath you're going to notice it has some  official Sriracha aioli sauce along with three   crunchy pickles guys there's no shortage of the  sauce to go with those pickles looking pretty   nice and that's sitting all on top of a crispy  chicken strip and as you can see it is glazed   in orange chicken sauce so this is looking pretty  tasty and I gotta admit the overall appearance of   the sauce along with the orange chicken goodness  is looking pretty nice so let's not waste any   more time on this one this is the all-new orange  chicken sandwich 2.0 here at the Panda Express   Innovation Kitchen in Pasadena California let's  peep out this flavor yes sir lots of Saucy action   with this one and I'm very thankful for the  little chicken sandwich diaper that this comes   with guys but again coming back to that chicken  nice and crispy and it looks like it fills out   this brioche style bun pretty nicely so without  further Ado let's confirm the goodness for you   because this is really smelling pretty awesome on  top of it it's the all-new orange chicken sandwich   2.0 we'll call it currently in test here at Panda  Express in Pasadena let's peep this out well right off the break aside from the appearance looking  launch ready the flavor feels launched ready guys   this really feels like it's something you can  just walk into Panda Express right now and get   very tasty on the chicken as you can see here and  with the nice crunch of the pickle action mixing   it with the orange chicken sauce I have to say  that's a lovely thing right there a little bit   of heat coming up on the back end from the spice  but I gotta admit it's really more front loaded   with the orange chicken goodness as you'd expect  it to be this is pretty nice let's keep going in mmm oh yeah well the main difference this time  around is there's no King's Hawaiian bun it's   actually a regular brioche style bun which  is fairly soft there's no shredded cabbage   and the spicy sauce itself is definitely labeled  Sriracha guys this is looking really really nice   and you'd hope the flavors would sync up to  be banging like that because guys the flavor   is definitely on point with this one pretty  nice so far yeah I'm not missing the King's   Hawaiian bread from the previous version that  I checked out not that long ago which you're   probably seeing up on your screen here right now  definitely take a look at that original review   because you can really truly see the differences  between the two but guys as it stands with this   I am totally digging the accent of the pickles  along with the orange chicken sauce it is really   really nice and a little bit of the Sriracha  aioli on this one a little bit of a creamier   texture but banging nonetheless let's go for  another couple of bites on it guys pretty tasty mmm yeah the brioche style bun really kind of  makes this one guys I mean it's very similar   to the same type of brioche bun you'd find  in all the other chicken sandwiches on the   market fast food wise so I guess I can see why  they swapped out the King's Hawaiian bread for   the brioche style for their version but guys on  its own I have to say with that extra sweetness   from the King's Hawaiian without that the  main focus is on the chicken a little bit   more because naturally you're tasting more of  the orange chicken goodness and naturally on   top of that with the spicy aioli as I'm being  attacked with flies all around me here right   now but guys I think they want a little bit of the  sandwich but very tasty on this one the creaminess   is definitely on point and brundlefly is still  flying around me over here let me go for one   more quick bite we'll wrap the review up with  the rating coming up next but this was just a   quickie addendum to my initial review to kind of  see what the differences were going to be with   this and I have to admit again I'm not missing  the King's Hawaiian bread I'm not missing the   shredded cabbage this feels more like a classic  type of chicken sandwich with the sauce the   chicken naturally the pickles and of course the  Brioche style bun so one more bite we'll wrap the   review up coming up next hang on one second  let's go for one more it's pretty tasty guys let me also mention that the pickles themselves  definitely have some sweetness to them on top   of it guys so they're obviously sweetened  up on top of the nice sweet spicy type of   sauce that I'm getting from the orange chicken  itself and then when you add the accent of the   Sriracha aioli guys the creamy factor is  definitely on point with this so as far as   I'm concerned this is launch ready I really hope  this one goes Nationwide and considering this is   a new version I have a feeling this one could be  showing up sooner rather than later pretty nice   all right we got a heavy fly situation going on  here so just to wrap this one up guys I'm gonna   have to give the upgraded version aka the orange  chicken sandwich 2.0 here at Panda Express The   Innovation Kitchen in Pasadena are pretty Rock  Solid 9 out of 10 like I said this really does   feel like a launch ready situation and I really  hope this finally does go Nationwide it really is   the second time that I've actually checked out  a test Market item that's pretty much the same   type of thing with a minor adjustment so I have a  feeling we're going to see this one a lot sooner   than later considering the popularity of chicken  sandwiches in general you'd expect something from   Panda at this point right pretty tasty on that one  all right so do me a favor like always drop some   comments down below let me know what you thought  of this particular
