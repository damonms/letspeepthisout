 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty bk's got both the stacker king and rodeo king currently on their menu at the same time so I'm more than a little curious to try the combination of them together since that's what's officially available back east that's right and as you've already seen by the title of this review it's the rodeo stacker King and we're going big on the triple version and as always a very glorious scene here guys we have the fusion of the stacker King and the rodeo king together featuring three-quarters of a pound of flame grilled beef here looking really really fantastic let's pop the top of this large sesame seed bun take a look inside we've got onion rings we've got stacker sauce we've got barbecue sauce we've got hickory smoked bacon we've got a whole bunch of cheese three slices of cheese here guys and of course I'm gonna try and split each layer for you lovely situation we got that cheese pull number one and we have that cheese pull number two nice and gooey it does not want to give guys but as you can see as it splits apart they're more of that goodness and of course on the bottom we have just the bun not that you need anything else guys with all the bacon and all the other fixings on this minus the mayo of course a very lovely situation very gluttonous very huge and a lot of Burger King goodness on display guys it smells fantastic so let's see if this one delivers in the flavor because I have a feeling it's going to it's the rodeo stacker King the triple version here at BK let's peep out this flavor and so are you a

drops every week let's dive into this one man that 3/4 pound of flame grilled beef looks and smells so fantastic right now with hints of barbecue sauce in the air here we go it's the rodeo stacker King the triple here at BK mmm man beef overload and what a heavenly overload that is plenty of beefy flavor on this one along with the American cheese and then the onion rings are very very nice with that barbecue sauce not so much the stacker sauce just yet but the hickory smoked bacon is there it's a lot of meaty cheesy goodness already let's go further in mmm man yeah this triple is playing no games for sure guys it's an appetite destroyer just like most of these burgers are here at BK and with the onion rings in the very top there along with the barbecue sauce and that bacon it's a very lovely situation a little bit of light sweetness at the very end from the stacker sauce but it's the barbecue sauce to me that's really taking center stage everything else with the cheesy goodness the same familiar flavors at BK but guys gluttonously overloaded deliciousness on point with this one really really tasty and hey real quick let me send a huge shout out over to my buddy the endorsement who told me about this shortly before his review launched a few weeks ago and they actually had this available back east officially I'm glad I was able to put this one together here on the west coast with the stacker King as well as the rodeo king available right now how could you not fuse these two together right I mean unofficially it's still the same flavors but officially back east with their marketing very very cool stuff I'll put a link to the endorsement's review down below make sure you jump on over and check it out but guys the triple is a heavenly situation this is really just an excuse for me to revisit this the first time I did the stacker king triple and I'm so glad that I did diggin the barbecue sauce with it let's go in again mmm the hickory smoked bacon is so insane with the barbecue sauce and those onion rings classic western ingredients in any type of like western themed burger but I have to say with the stacker sauce added it's a little bit of extra sweetness at the very end again the barbecue sauce is the dominant player on top of three layers of beefy goodness guys three-quarters of a pound of beef can't speak more highly about it well actually I could but I think you get the point right now let's go for one more bite one more close-up and we'll finish this one out man this is so delicious mmm okay this sandwich is becoming very messy with everything about to fall out the back here but I'm gonna go 360 for you to give you all the goodies in effect in HD three patties a flame grilled goodness the good stuff you already know from BK we've got the bacon the cheese the barbecue sauce the onion rings the stacker sauce everything included guys everything your heart can contend with literally in one sandwich here it's gluttonous and the three patty version but insane and again the onion rings and that barbecue sauce and the bacon is an awesome highlight to this one really really tasty stuff yesir an awesome fusion of the rodeo king and the stacker King both burgers that I've already reviewed the past as well what you guys can also find down below in the description box if you curious to hear my thoughts on them let's just say they were both really really delicious and you've got plenty of delicious footage to look forward to if you decide to check those out but when it comes to the actual hybrid fusion unofficially officially whatever you want to call it that I just checked out let's just say it rocks so with that said I'm gonna have to give the rodeo stacker King the triple variant here at BK a rock solid 10 out of 10 every single individual ingredient of this burger stood out exactly the way I expected it to guys and I'm glad the stacker sauce kind of came up at the end there because I was a little worried about it with the overabundance of the barbecue sauce and the flavors it was delivering everything else was definitely on point and again you can't beat 3/4 of a pound of beef guys it's gluttonous but it's super delicious a highly recommended hybrid burger you should definitely check out but of course the question is are you gonna check it out drop some comments down below have you had the stacker King already have you had the rodeo King already have you had a triple version of any of them together drop those comments down below let me know if you're gonna give these a go I'm very curious to hear
