the amazing customer service and to all the team over there you guys absolutely rock i cannot wait to give this a go and obviously guys how could i not take a look at the amazingness that this is lots of goodness here guys pickles beef cheese lots of it muenster cheese one of my favorites can't wait to give this a go guys let's do it right now it's the bacon pretzel pub hamburger here at wendy's let's do it well hopefully you guys caught that oh halfway into the bite because i had to let that out guys i was going into an immediate amount of beef and heavy amounts of beer cheese and muenster cheese at the same time and the flavor instantly was hitting me as i was going in this is pretty amazing already let me just show you real fast here guys this is absolutely flavorful that smoky honey mustard is really standing out on the applewood smoked bacon the crispy goodness haven't gotten any pickles yet but man this thing is loaded with flavor and of course the pretzel bun action is amazing on this right now i love the feel i love that textural feel that it's got let's keep going oh man you guys have got to do the double on this when you give this a shot i mean it's just the perfect amount of extra beefiness on top of all the other ingredients and there's so much going on under this burger right now that it really makes the difference just the combination is awesome and while you can definitely do a triple version of this burger believe me i almost did that i thought that would have been just too much beef considering all the amount of toppings on this right now so for me personally i think the double is perfect it's got the right amount of beef i think just to make it even super heartier than it already is with all the toppings on top of that and again guys just an insane situation right there i mean just look at that it is absolutely glorious in terms of flavor and presentation really really awesome stuff let's keep going there we go got some pickles there that is nice that is just so good i'm telling you we need a burger like this right now because there's so much going on underneath there's so many different flavor profiles all at the same time and when you combine that with the fresh never frozen beef over here at wendy's that is just a beautiful combination just an awesome situation and again the beer cheese alone guys it's worth it just for that and the muenster cheese of course everything is flavorful you can taste everything there's not one thing overpowering the other and obviously the applewood smoked bacon is awesome here as well but just an awesome situation of beefy cheesy goodness and it really does satisfy why they don't call this the pretzel bacon pub cheeseburger is beyond me naturally just hamburger you think there's gonna be no cheese on it but it's got plenty of cheese and it is so super flavorful so guys let me get one more bite of this one before we finish it up after the rating and of course the close-up is coming up in just a second hang on yes sir some meaty cheesy goodness on an epic scale guys the double really is the perfect amount of beef as far as i'm concerned a half pound of goodness right here with all the toppings this is just an amazing combination that beer cheese the saltiness that i'm getting from that is perfect with the muenster cheese as well and the smoky honey mustard the crispy onions even we haven't really talked about because there's so much going on here along with the applewood smoked bacon just a lovely situation and just a beautiful burger in general awesome stuff yeah pretty glorious stuff and i gotta admit coming back to the pretzel bun after about six years here at wendy's this is a really really beautiful situation in the beef department and the first version that i did all those years ago was actually the pretzel pub chicken sandwich which you guys can find in the upper right-hand corner of your display right now although that one was very different back then this variation is completely that concept on steroids because it's all the stuff that wendy's does amazingly well without the greens so i gotta admit i really like that so if you really need me to confirm the obvious score for this one i'm gonna have to give the pretzel bacon pub hamburger over here at wendy's a rock solid 10 out of 10 guys the flavor profile is through the roof you guys are going to love it even in single form double which i would recommend triple i think might be a little too much but even still you have options and that's a beautiful situation three quarters of a pound of beef should be pretty awesome i think a half pound is perfect and naturally with all those toppings with so much going on there the applewood smoked bacon the smoky honey mustard the crispy onions the pickles the muenster cheese the beer cheese and of course the pretzel bun it's pretty insane so guys like i said run on over to wendy's give this one a shot it's the burger we really need right now and it absolutely delivers pretty awesome all right so now the obvious question because i already know you're gonna run over and give this one a shot it's an amazing hamburger over here do me a
