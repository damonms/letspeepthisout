just both of them that'd be awesome great thank you much now i've tried just about every version of fast food beyond meat that there is right now mostly from carl's jr so i'm excited to see what the colonel can bring to the table hello yes thank you so much finger looking good sauce and ranch please oh beautiful thanks so much that's awesome thank you appreciate it stay frosty appreciate you we'll see you bye alright guys let's peep this out so let's go in on it it's beyond fried chicken here at kfc and right off the bat guys there is lots of fried goodness wafting up in the car here right now this is definitely smelling pretty decent what you're looking at is 12 pieces of beyond meat that's formed into chicken nuggets and then deep fried to a crispy golden brown of course it's going to feature the 11 herbs and spices that kfc is known for but i got to admit it smells pretty authentic let me lift one of these up here so you guys can take a closer look at this take a look at that nicely fried nicely golden nicely crispy looking absolutely right there and it's got some heft to it these actually feel pretty heavy 12 piece order is what you're looking at here as well for dipping we've got some finger licking good sauce and some ranch we're going to see how that flavor is going to go with that beyond meat on the inside but so far i'm digging the presentation i'm digging that aroma and these are halfway decent looking and for the price considering the premium it is fairly decent in terms of what you're looking at here at least in my opinion let's give this one a go and see if the flavor is going to deliver it's beyond fried chicken here at kfc let's peep out this flavor yeah definitely some nice crispy fried goodness to go with the nice heftiness of this box here right now guys this is actually looking really really solid so before i take the first bite of this one again let me give you another close-up here as you can see nice and crispy nice and golden you can really see the seasonings pretty nicely on that as well it really is fried up pretty perfectly in my opinion so far so let's not waste any more time but real quick and like always if

content drops every week guys here we go beyond meat and kfc together it's beyond fried chicken please be good because it smells pretty good it's definitely got the texture of chicken believe it or not mmm that's different and what i mean by different is it appears to have a little bit more pull or chew to it compared to regular chicken but the appearance of it take a look at that on the inside guys that actually looks really really good almost like white meat chicken and you can almost see the individual strands and the fibers in there as well and of course the crispiness on the outside as well of the coating the seasoning it really just tastes more fried i'm not really getting anything above and beyond the regular kfc chicken but this is really a nice fake version if i can call it that and it really is kind of fitting the mold of what i think this type of chicken should be like with the kfc goodness minus a little bit of the 11 herbs and spices and i'm saying that because i'm not really getting any real crazy flavor to let me know that it's kfc believe it or not it just feels like a very heavily fried nugget but i'm feeling like it's chicken that's the thing it's playing with my head right now let's go for another bite let's just keep going with it i like it though it's good it's got that pull i like it though it's crazy to think that there is no meat in this whatsoever but if you look at this it looks like it actually is white meat chicken and a decent amount of it too guys take a look at that it's not super juicy but it does have that flavor that's reminiscent of chicken it's really kind of hard to explain but i'm getting a lot more of the fried goodness of the coating on the outside than anything else but i'm really digging the presentation and it really is playing with my head right now in terms of me having a chicken nugget that's actually plant-based yeah it's definitely different but believe it or not this is actually working better for me in this form compared to regular beyond meat i mean naturally i love the beef patties i love the other versions that they have like the regular hamburger style but this seems to lend itself a little bit more credibly in my opinion to actual chicken because the appearance looks really really awesome and the overall feeling and mouth feel that i'm getting actually while i'm eating this along with the crispiness of the outer coating is really spot on so i'm digging it yeah that's really really good i mean it feels like a very very tasty chicken nugget but with kfc's namesake that's on it there naturally so speaking of kfc's namesake let's go for a little finger licking good sauce with this right now and see if this is actually gonna do anything overall naturally with this type of sauce anyway i think it's gonna be good with all the fried goodness on the outer coatings of these but let's just give it a shot for you real fast and as you can see lots of that tasty goodness there this almost feels like a kicked up thousand island type dressing but i have to see how it's gonna go with this beyond meat so let's give it a shot mmm that's good that's good that semi thousand island type of flavor that i'm getting from the finger licking good sauce on top of the fried coating on the outside of the beyond fried chicken goes amazingly well anyway and then you get into the nice give and the pull of the actual beyond meat itself on the inside and again guys feast your eyes on just how that looks i really like the fact that it looks like actual chicken that is just really really cool just the appearance of it alone is selling this one on top of everything else on the outside but again those 11 herbs and spices are probably in here for sure because that's the main thing for kfc but i'm not really getting anything above and beyond a really tasty fried outer coating but again with that finger licking good sauce this is actually really good okay and since most of you guys who watch my channel know i'm a huge fan of ranch i absolutely had to go for that as well so i definitely want to give this a shot at least one time with that goodness to see exactly how this is going to go with beyond meat really really good in terms of just the overall appearance and everything with this guys i am really digging this because of what it is it's really really fun to eat like this and with ranch let's see how that's gonna work here let's give it a shot hmm i like this better with ranch so much better with ranch that tangy tartness of the ranch anyway along with anything fried is going to be amazing and again the quality of the beyond meat on the inside and i got to keep showing this to you because i am really blown away by the appearance of it is really selling this one here guys it really is a nice alternative to what they offer here at kfc and i got to admit aside from the premium price that this is i kind of feel like i'm getting what i'm paying for believe it or not because the quality is pretty high on what this is i only wish that the seasoning was just a little bit more pronounced like regular kfc if i can call it that but for what this is pretty tasty let me go for one more bite of this one maybe we'll knock this one out real quick and i'm gonna try and split one for you as we finish this one up here so after the rating of course we'll wrap it let's just finish it out okay so let's see if we can just break one of these really quick just to give you an idea if this actually looks like chicken and guys take a look at that as it's being ripped apart it absolutely does this really feels like white meat chicken big time not super juicy but look at the quality of what you're getting here this is looking like the part it really smells like the part and it's actually kind of tasting like the part believe it or not as well i am really digging this guys it's a lot of fun and i really hope this goes national it should at this point because it really looks fantastic and it's pretty solid in terms of flavor plant-based fried chicken kfc it's finger licking magic so with that said i'm gonna have to give the beyond fried chicken here at kfc a pretty solid 8.8 out of 10 if only if it was just a little bit more kfc-like in terms of flavor that's really the only thing those 11 herbs and spices that distinct flavor that kfc had is just a little muted with this version but at least the quality of that fried coating is amazing it's crispy it's golden it's made pretty well and the inside of the beyond meat itself is pretty rock solid just pulling it apart you can see it looks and appears like actual chicken so guys it's great to have a protein alternative this is a solid one i really hope this one goes national it is something i would get again and honestly i'm probably going to while it's here in southern cali pretty tasty okay now the obvious question are you going to be giving this one a shot when it goes national and if you've got it available to you right now in places where it is available what do you personally think of it drop some comments down below are you a fan of beyond meat in general and how do you think this actually compares to overall chicken drop those comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K closing out another high quality foodie feature for ya here on peep this out reviews
