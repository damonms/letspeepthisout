wienerschnitzel let me lift some of these up here this really really smells really good already guys you're going to hear it a lot really really really all throughout this review this is looking really really good so take a look at that there some of that signature chili action let's give it a shot let's see how this cheese sauce if it's going to have some pop i'm hoping so let's do it um it's thick it's already very thick wow heavy cheddar i'm getting all across the board here mmm salty cheesy potatoey chili all at the same time that is a lovely situation this cheese sauce is definitely very very thick lemme try and give you a little bit more of these close-ups here all throughout the shredded cheddar cheese is a nice accent on the top but the thick pungentness it's almost like a pub cheese believe it or not that i'm getting from that ooey gooey goodness this really is pretty awesome guys one more look at that signature chili action delicious stuff over here at wienerschnitzel i mean they're known for their chili obviously chili dogs regular chili fries but when you have even more cheese on top of it lovely situation let's keep going in really good yeah that is a very very thick beer cheese type of consistency that i'm getting with this one here it's noticeably thicker you can tell right away and then you're getting the accents of the shredded cheddar on top of it and naturally with the light spicing a little bit of the heat that i'm getting from the chili in general nice combination a very beautiful combination actually and speaking of combinations you can actually get this cheese on two other items on the menu you've got their double cheese chili dog as well as the double cheese fries which is really just what i'm having right now minus the chili but guys really really tasty that combination of the meaty goodness with the chili itself is really really nice let me get some more of this here give you another close-up look at this here that is nice really really good stuff guys really really good stuff let's go for one more bite this is really delicious um yeah yeah this one's getting me right in the very back right now because it's very pungent on the cheese sauce itself and not only is it just thick on top of it that extra flavor is really really beginning to come through as i'm getting further into this along with the chili and guys like i said even though it's a semi-small portion of fries it's filling and it's very very dense so nice on this one i'm gonna go for one more bite i know i keep saying it but i just want to get a little bit more of this action here for you and uh yeah you're going to really dig this last close-up over here this is some cheesy goodness by far we'll finish this one up after the rating obviously hang on one second ooey gooey cheesy deliciousness for sure if you guys have a wienerschnitzel in the area you need to be jumping on over right now because you know what with this stuff out right now i can wait for oktoberfest and going for some pretzels with pub cheese there this is actually going to satisfy nicely and as you can see the cheese is very thick on these fries just a beautiful situation and again that combination on the inside is lovely like i said semi-small portion of fries but very dense and very filling nice stuff dive into all the new cheesy goodness during ooze fest at wienerschnitzel yeah definitely nice stuff so overall i'm gonna have to give the double cheese chili fries as part of ooze fest here at wienerschnitzel i definitely love that name by the way a very rock solid 9 out of 10 this truly delivers the double cheese aspect you can really taste it it's very hearty very thick and i gotta admit from what i remember of the regular chili cheese fries it's noticeably elevated because of that cheese level so guys ooey gooey cheesy deliciousness for sure with this one and like i've always said in the past you really can't go wrong with a pretty good solid cheese sauce and some hot fries and this really is a very nice addition over here especially with our signature chili guys just a beautiful combination overall and very very hearty great stuff all right so now the obvious question did this actually look like some pretty great stuff to you do me a quick favor drop some comments down below are you a fan of wienerschnitzel if you've got them in the area and if you've ever had them in the past what do you think of their chili overall is this something that you think you'd want to try with that extra ooey gooey goodness because i'm
