 hey everyone I'm back at it and it looks like so is Wendy's with another take on a true American classic so stay tuned because it's up next welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty so here we go with the big bacon classic double and you can definitely tell this is a Wendy's burger by those square patties right there guys looking really really nice let's take a look at this bun here nice and soft and a little semi toasted actually underneath it we've got a little bit of mayo we've got some pickles looks like we've got some onions a tomato slice a slice of leaf lettuce and underneath that is the good stuff guys applewood smoked bacon looks like we've got three strips there we've got some melty American cheese and a half pound of fresh never frozen beef along with another slice of cheese let me see if I can split this and go for a little bit of that cheesy action right there really gooey very delicious looking really really nice as you can see cooked very nicely underneath it looks like it is just the bottom of the bun but guys essentially what we've got here is the Dave's double with some applewood smoked bacon hence the new name we've got here now as well the big bacon classic double at Wendy's let's see if the flavor's gonna deliver on this one how could it not let's peep out this flavor you know this looks like it's got a little bit of ketchup in here as well I don't know if I mentioned that with that initial closer but guys it's very stacked and with that extra patty of beef on here it's looking pretty lovely and hey just like I said earlier this is essentially the Dave's double with some bacon thrown into the mix so I'm technically killing two birds with one stone since I've never reviewed that burger so let's just get into it but before I do in like always if you guys are fans of high-quality delicious looking food reviews make sure to hit that subscribe button down below and don't forget to tap the Bell icon so you could be notified as soon as brand-new content drops every week guys it's the Dave's double with bacon aka the big bacon classic double here at Wendy's let's do it mmm beefy and cheesy oh yeah right off the break that classic Wendy's flavor is lit up ridiculously right now guys that extra patty makes a huge difference admittedly the meats a little on the drier side for me right now but the cheese and all the bacon flavor is coming through beautifully to kind of save the day but guys it's very hearty all the veggies on this as well nice and fresh and overall it really does taste like the iconic classic double cheeseburger with bacon thrown into the mix let's go for another bite and we'll give you another close up guys pretty tasty you know that though right semi dry patties are not what's really saving this one right now is that light mayo mixed with the ketchup and I'm really diggin that combination because mayo is not really my thing so the ketchup is definitely the stronger of those two and then you have the nice cheese action going in there the applewood smoked bacon the saltiness is on point across-the-board and overall a very hearty double cheeseburger guys but you know that already it's classic for a reason it's really good you know diving into this burger is one thing but the anticipation of getting ready for that first bite is another guys it's really a very well presented burger the beef is definitely standing out big time here it really looked like it was gonna be amazing after that first bite and it is it's all the classic Wendy's flavors that you already know the applewood smoked bacon second to none the crispiness is absolutely there cooked perfectly as well and the cheese is perfectly melted the only thing is just the patties themselves are just a little on the drier side but there's so much moisture coming from everything else I don't think you're gonna mind that too much guys super flavorful either way and that's in addition to the light toastiness of that soft type bun that it's got here guys really tasty stuff let's go for one more bite we'll wrap this one up with the rating but it's a delicious double cheeseburger it's a classic double cheeseburger it's an iconic double cheeseburger with bacon let's do it so let's do a little 360 with this one and as you can see it's definitely a wet burger for sure make sure you've got some napkins or you at least have this one wrapped up as you're eating it that combination of the light mayo that I have here along with the ketchup is making this one just a little slippery but as you can see all the good stuff is here guys everything that Wendy's does extremely well is really on display for you the applewood smoked bacon is a highlight and overall it's just a very hearty iconic double cheeseburger the Dave's double if you will with applewood smoked bacon very good yeah it's a pretty delicious double cheeseburger indeed so with that said I'm gonna have to give the Dave's double with bacon aka the big bacon classic double here at Wendy's a pretty rock-solid 9 out of 10 if only those patties were just a little bit juicier it would have been perfect across the board because as it stands it virtually is all those classic wendy's flavors are there for you you guys are fans of applewood smoked bacon and i think many of you are you have a lot to look forward to with this one do the double because i'm telling you just getting a single is not gonna do it for you you really want to make sure you have a lot of that meat 1/2 pound before cooking really makes a difference and it's
