an order of one of those new sauced and loaded curly fries the steak and parm version please and that's it no drink that's it looks good yeah great thanks alright looks pretty decent now they have that cheddar bacon variant up there as well but that's kind of like a been there done that but anything with steak I'm absolutely on it   yeah how you doin' today aww norries no worries oh no that's fine appreciate it you too stay frosty we'll see 'ya alright guys let's peep this out so here we go with the steak and parm sauced and loaded fries here at jack in the box and already I'm getting huge hints of garlic in the air not so much parmesan but heavy heavy garlic I'm really diggin' that actually it smells really really great what we've got here is a fairly deep portion of their seasoned curly fries topped off with a garlic white cheese sauce and marinated steak it looks very decadent guys and again when I say a decent portion it pretty much fills this container very nicely here so nice quantity overall for 3 bucks I'm definitely diggin' it I like the fact that there's a decent amount of steak let's see if the flavor is gonna deliver on this one guys it's the all new steak parm sauced and loaded fries here at jack in the box let's peep out this flavor yeah definitely strong hints of garlic on the air to go with that white cheese sauce this is smelling very lovely in the car right now so before I take the first bite and as always if you guys are fans of high quality delicious looking food reviews which I think most of you are make sure to hit that subscribe button down below and don't forget to tap the bell icon so you can be notified when new content drops every week so guys the steak and parm sauced and loaded curly fries here at jack in the box let's go for a little bit of everything on this one there is a large amount of cheese I can already see it has dripped down to the bottom let's give it a go mmm oh my god so good rich mmm creamy on that cheese gets 'ya in the very back it's very strong wow it's a lovely situation already look at the steak on that that is a large chunk of loveliness right there let's keep going mmm yesir and nice rich white cheese sauce laced with a nice amount of garlic and while I'm not getting a lot of flavor from the steak itself there is a nice softness to it and a nice amount of chew and of course the toastiness from those fries guys the seasoned goodness that these fries offer combines beautifully with all of these ingredients just a lovely situation yeah the cheese sauce is definitely pretty awesome over here at jack in the box whenever they have these sauced and loaded fries I'm so glad they use a really thick rich type of sauce to really compliment the fries themselves it doesn't really matter what toppings you get on top of that everything else combines beautifully with that cheese anyway and the combination works the only thing with this I'm not really tasting any parmesan so I'm not sure why they call it that these are more like steak and garlic fries or garlic steak fries something like that but nice quality guys it really is delicious mmm man and another cool thing about is the older it gets the more the cheese begins to clump so if you're able to some of those clumped pieces some of the actual fries and like in the nooks and crannies on top of it it give it even more of a chew because it's globbed together it's a lovely situation and like with all of my reviews it's always a situation right just a nice tasty snack for 3 bucks and while I am getting further into this right now I'm beginning to find that there's not too much steak it's kind of front loaded on the very top so I probably should've mixed it around a bit but guys the fries are delicious the flavor is awesome and again for 3 bucks you're getting a very rich decadent tasty snack I gotta admit I'm gonna be getting this one again it's really good so not too much else to say about this one it's the quality seasoned curly fries here at jack in the box with a very very nice white cheese sauce nice hints of garlic and a decent amount of chew from that steak guys it's just a really tasty option for 3 bucks and definitely something that I think will fit into your late night regimen pretty nicely hit this one after hours guys it's gonna be fun to get like that too try my $3 steak and parm loaded curly fries get 'em delivered with doordash but just to be on the safe side ask for a little extra steak 'cuz I'm telling you you're gonna want more of it it really goes very nicely with the cheese sauce I really wish I had a few more pieces so with all that said I'm gonna have to give the steak and "parm" sauced and loaded fries here at jack in the box a pretty decent 8.1 out of 10 if this one had a little bit more steak on it and maybe a little bit more parmesan flavor it'd easily be in the 8.5, 9 category but as it stands for 3 bucks the quantity is good the flavor is awesome but again ask for a little extra steak you're gonna really want that now of course the obvious segue question at least to me anyway is are you gonna want what you just saw right now drop those comments down below and lemme know if you've got a jack in the box in the area first and foremost and if you are gonna give this one a shot what did you guys think of the way the steak looked on the version I reviewed right now drop those comments down below and definitely lemme know and with that this is Ian K closing out another episode of peep this out bringing you brand new content every single week here on my channel so while you stay tuned for that next review coming real soon in the mean time stay frosty hey jack if you ask me I think we need another breakfast variant of something like this or maybe even like a pizza variant I can easily see some tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese and a little bit of sausage on this something like that that would be pretty amazing just saying alright guys until next I'll talk to you soon but hey real quick before you go and just in case you haven't already take a look at the last review that I put out right up over here along with what I think Youtube's gonna
