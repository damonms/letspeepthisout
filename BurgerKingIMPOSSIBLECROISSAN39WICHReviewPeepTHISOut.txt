 hey everyone it's Ian K for peep this out reviews back at it on over a good old BK because it looks like they're doing the impossible for breakfast that's right so stay tuned because the impossible croissan'wich is up next welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty well it was only a matter of time after the impossible whopper that we'd get something for breakfast and here it is the impossible croissan'wich and as expected it looks pretty tasty actually this is looking really really good with a nice buttery croissant top let's take a look underneath it here looks like we've got some American cheese stuck to it but the main star of the show is gonna be the sausage patty itself made 100 percent of plants and definitely smelling like breakfast sausage kind of looks like breakfast sauces too minus some of the grill marks there but I am really really diggin the overall aroma that I'm getting in the car right now we've got an egg as well underneath it a nice folded egg and on the bottom of that nothing the very bottom of the croissant as well but as you can see a pretty basic build on this one but the main selling feature is definitely gonna be that guy right there the impossible sausage patty looking and smelling really good it really smells like genuine sausage I'm really diggin that so let's see if the flavors gonna deliver on this one it's the impossible croissan'wich new for breakfast here at BK let's peep out this flavor well I'm definitely not a morning person right now and I'm really not minding that so much because the smell of this in my car right now is keeping me awake and I gotta say like I mentioned in that close up it smells very authentic I mean guys this really does smell like a breakfast sausage here and it actually looks like it as well too lookin pretty nice here and of course that butteriness of that croissant that i'm feeling on my fingers I'm hoping this is gonna be pretty tasty so before i confirm that for ya and like

new content drops every week guys the impossible croissan'wich here at BK let's do it mm-hmm Wow alright now admittedly I have never had impossible breakfast sausage at all this is my very first time going in on it and I gotta say it is very very authentic if you were to blindfold me and tell me this was regular breakfast sausage I probably say yes it definitely is I'm not tasting any real difference the spicing is definitely spot-on and guys overall it really does the part in terms of the looks department and the flavor Department to go with so of course you've got that egg on the bottom not quite tasting the cheese just yet but that croissant is a lovely situation nice and buttery and I'm really taking the overall flavor on this one and actually you can really feel good about the fact this is not pork it's a hundred percent plants it's crazy let's keep going man I am definitely all for these alternative proteins and this really does fit the bill on what a breakfast sausage should taste like but just knowing that it's not pork like I mentioned is a huge huge bonus right there and of course all the classic flavors that you'd get for breakfast over here at BK are there as well the egg is pretty good the cheese is kind of coming through the American cheese slice but it's really the spicing and the overall patty the star of the show that impossible patty therefore the sausage it's really doing a number right now but in such a good way and like I said guys the quality is really really nice for a fast food breakfast sandwich on the better end because of the protein style that you're getting here because it's plants this is really really good and again that buttery croissant it's a little gluttonous but it's nice it's BK I'm definitely diggin it but overall I think they've really done a solid job with this one so yeah pretty tasty in the overall mouthfeel again is very spot-on to what breakfast sausage would taste like especially in patty form like this so you're getting kind of the denseness that's there it's not very mushy it's got some texture it's got some firmness and the overall spicing is what delivers on this one so guys very authentic like I said and this is something that I would easily get again being that I'm not a breakfast person like I mentioned I would get up actually once in a while to give this one a go because it is pretty tasty so one more bite with this one we'll finish this one up after the rating but it's worth it guys pretty tasty I think they've done the impossible justice over here at BK at least for breakfast right pretty good well I'm definitely glad to have checked this one out and I'm very glad to have gotten up early this morning to give this one a go like I said it really does deliver that sausage patty flavor but knowing that it's a hundred percent plant based is an absolute bonus so easy recommendation if you're up early to give this one a shot I would recommend it it is pretty solid so with that said I'm gonna have to give the impossible croissan'wich here BK or rock-solid 9 out of 10 the only thing keeping this one from the perfect 10 out of 10 is really the price point I think at $4.99 it's maybe a dollar or so more expensive than it needs to be but for the quality of what you're getting there right now and of course the brand name with it that's pretty much I think what's hiking the price up just a bit there the quality like I said is worth it so give this one a shot at least once and let me know if you actually think there's a difference in taste because like I said it's really authentic in terms of what breakfast sausage tastes like especially in patty form all right so now the obvious question are you gonna give this one a shot do me a quick favor drop some comments down below are you a fan of alternative proteins like all these plant-based patties that are out nowadays and what do you think of the impossible brand are you really interested to give the breakfast
