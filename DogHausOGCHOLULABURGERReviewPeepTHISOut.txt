Cholula burger is up next welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty here we go with the latest haus burger from the peeps over at the dog haus it's the og Cholula burger and guys I am already loving what I'm seeing here right now this is looking and smelling fantastic instantly greeted with that four piece King's Hawaiian on the very top and makes the capper to this bun lovely situation let's take a look on the inside this is pretty big looks like we've got a little bit of that Cholula Mayo in action right now this is a nice joint venture between Cholula and the dog haus we've got a fried egg and underneath that guys take a look at this a lovely situation there we've got some Cholula brown sugar bacon a lovely situation indeed you're gonna hear that all throughout this review looks like an onion jam as well Cholula based and guys that fried egg again is a lovely situation I can't stop saying it because it looks awesome guys take a look a little further down you can kind of see it there it's all blending together but we've got a 100% Angus beef patty and there is American cheese in there as well let me see if I can go a little further it's very messy yeah that's about as far as I can go this is as fresh as you can get it's super hot but guys a nice combination of Cholula goodness with that bacon we've got the cheese the onion jam we've got that Cholula mayo in here the fried egg I don't know how I'm gonna do this but I'm definitely gonna have a lot of fun trying and again the fried egg goodness with that yokey goodness on the very bottom a nice nice say with me lovely situation guys let's get into this one and see if the flavors gonna deliver it's the og Cholula burger here at the dog haus let's peep out this flavor yeah it is seriously about to go down right now this absolutely feels like a culinary type of masterpiece that I'm holding right now because of the combination of those high-end ingredients it really looks and smells pretty fantastic and again guys look at that presentation right there it looks fantastic I love the tray that it comes in definitely a lovely situation here and of course they've got the right idea open wide I think I'm about to I had to split this one down the middle because it is too messy to pick up all at once and that's part of the reason they serve it on King Hawaiian I think because not only is the flavor amazing but you can cut these in fourths so I wanted to go just half way and really kind of dive into it so before I do just that and like always if you guys are fans of high-quality delicious

Cholula burger let me try and lift up a half of this because this is super super messy but Wow oh man I got to show this to you right away take a look at that that is a lovely situation like I said earlier you're gonna hear that all throughout this review that looks amazing right now let's go for a bite of this one I'm super excited let's do it mmm oh so juicy the heat it's there but not crazy a beautiful accent to the whole flavor profile mmm Wow right away after that as you're chewing it the denseness of that American cheese and that patty is really coming through and of course the nice softness of the King's Hawaiian guys that is a lovely situation a light sweetness that I'm getting from that brown sugar bacon and that onion jam as well that cholula goodness you can tell is all throughout this a nice quality burger so far let's go for another bite huh Oh man I haven't even gotten to the egg yet which is definitely a flavorful fried egg in and of itself the yolk is absolutely prevalent on this and it adds to the overall experience I absolutely love eggs on burgers and this is done extremely well guys are gonna get a lot of close-ups here that onion jam the brown sugar bacon the Cholula goodness all throughout this is an insane situation so definitely a beautiful collaboration so far with cholula's brand chef Jessica Bograd along with dog haus over here putting it down she also happens to be an award-winning barbecue pitmaster herself so nice collaboration effort between these two companies so far and I got to say everything this is delivering right now is off the chart in terms of the flavor it is absolutely delicious the American cheese the bacon everything with it let's keep going hmm man this thing is gonna get destroyed before I leave after doing this review right now Wow oh and hey did I mention this is absolutely a lovely situation again guys you're gonna get lots of it plenty of thick-cut bacon on this one and the overall experience is beautiful all the way around including the light sweetness from those King's Hawaiian buns right there so if you decide to cut these into fourths and go for the slider action you're gonna get that much less to enjoy upfront but you can obviously knock off the whole thing and you know it's also beautiful about this you can actually feel good about getting this burger because a dollar of every sale of it goes towards the no Kid Hungry campaign right now which is actually a beautiful thing so the more of those you buy the more goes towards that initiative so no Kid Hungry definitely a bonus but I got to say guys the bonus for me right now on top of all of that is the amazing flavor this is delivering and that nice heat that I'm getting that's kind of sizzling up on the back is still holding its own this is just super super delicious let's go for one more bite one more close-up and will absolutely close this one out after the rating but I think you can tell it is probably one of the best burgers I think I've ever had from dog haus this is a beautiful situation one more bite alright so let me give you a closing shot of the other half and as you can see there was really nothing else to say about this one I think a picture is worth a million words in this case and as you can see everything is lit up ridiculous so guys definitely jump on over to dog haus if you've got one in the area everything makes this one sing all the flavor ingredients including that onion jam well it's definitely the jam because it goes amazing with everything on here the brown sugar bacon there's really nothing else to say about it guys just go run on out and give us a shot you're not gonna be disappointed it is absolutely worth your time you know I had a feeling I was going to enjoy this burger because the quality of the food over here at dog haus is pretty solid I've had a lot of fun reviewing their stuff in the past I've actually got a few things up in my dog house playlist you can take a look at right now so this is a beautiful addition to that and probably gonna be the crown jewel because of what it is it really is a super delicious burger and aside from it being a pretty solid collaboration between Cholula and the dog haus it's really great to know that a dollar of each sale of that burger goes towards a very good cause so that no Kid Hungry initiative is a beautiful thing and that's definitely something I think every kid in America should give a shot to give a try because like I said it is super super delicious so with that said I'm gonna have to give the og Cholula burger here at the dog haus the obvious 10 out of 10 a super super delicious flavor profile on that one with just the right amount of sizzle to let you know that the hot sauce is in there but all the sweetness from that onion jam the bacon everything with it the cheese the Angus patty everything with super fresh super delicious and it's on toasted Kings Hawaiian rolls guys what more do you really need you really need to be given that a shot I think I'm trying to push it a little too hard on you right now it's only because it's so fantastic and I can't wait to get into the rest of this after we finish doing this alright so do me a quick favor jump on down into that comment section down below drop some comments let me know if you're gonna be giving this one a shot over here at the dog haus and if
