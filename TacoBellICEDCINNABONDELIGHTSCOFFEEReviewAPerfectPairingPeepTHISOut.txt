 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty what's going on everyone it's Ian K and welcome  or welcome back to the channel where i'm outside   on a beautiful sunny day here in southern cali  after hitting up taco bell to check out the latest   sweet treat they've got going on and guys this one  is right up my alley feast your eyes on their iced   cinnabon delights coffee very lovely situation  and a very tall cup of goodness we're about to   get into right now i think this is looking pretty  great so very simply what we've got here is some   of their premium roast coffee mixed up with some  vanilla creamer and cinnabon delights flavor along   with plenty of ice and as you guys can see  it's looking very refreshing i can't wait to   get into this guys very simple on this one and  i'm thinking it's going to deliver that flavor   and how could it not right i mean iced coffee  is one of my all-time favorites anyway and this   is actually the first time i'm trying this  over here at taco bell for the very first   time naturally this is not on happy hour special  it was $2.79 after two o'clock i tested it to see   but even still let's just give  it a shot guys i'm very curious oh yeah lots of cinnamon and  vanilla on this this is refreshing not overly sweet but it goes down easy  very creamy tasting on top of it as well   price point's a little high on this one though  considering the size mickey d's has something   comparable for about $2.79 but on special it's  like 99 cents always it's a lot bigger than   this but this does have the official cinnabon  license so let's just keep going in pretty good oh yeah that vanilla mostly cinnamon up front  but i am totally digging the quality of the   coffee on this this is really rich and smooth  mmm oh yeah absolutely first time having a nice   coffee over here at taco bell very good experience  already so far let's go for another few on this that actually is really good and i guess the  size is not too bad i mean it's one of the   elongated cups as you can see here kind of  feels like a medium drink that they kind of   stretch to make it look a lot taller and  i kind of dig that it looks kind of cool   but very frosty very creamy tasting  lots of cinnamon flavor pretty nice wow you know what would actually  go really really good with this   and i think you can tell by the thumbnail a  cinnabon delight let's give this a shot guys   it's been a minute since i've had one of these a  nice little donut hole filled with some icing and   it looks like some powdered sugar on the outside  the cinnamon goodness there let's give it a go hold on got to chase it with some of this this  is really good oh that is the combo   take a look at that on the inside guys  nice and creamy hopefully that's going   to try and focus focus focus focus my  focus needs focus today but as you can   see a little bit of the icing on the inside of  that fried crispy donut hole action pretty nice there it is as i'm losing the filling that  is really nice guys really nice keep going in oh yeah this is the combo all the way around  a little bit of the iced cinnabon delights   coffee as well as one of the cinnabon delights guys pretty nice oh yeah really good the cream goes amazing with  the coffee that's tasty   you guys remember those cap'n crunch delights a  while back i actually did those way back in the   day i think it was like 2015 like seven plus years  ago take a look at that review jumping up on your   screen right now if you haven't checked that out i  gotta say the cinnabon delights are definitely the   way to go when it comes to those types of things  from what i remember from the cap'n crunch bites   they didn't really kind of taste like the cereal  so to speak but they were red i believe so cream   filled still with those cinnabon delights have  it all over it they're real tasty and with this   very very lovely situation guys really really  nice iced coffee you've seen one iced coffee   you've seen them all it's pretty much the same  thing with the cream but with the flavor of the   cinnabon delight goodness on the inside so let's  go for another cup on this guy it's pretty tasty man i like that i really like that  it's a subtle type of cinnamon flavor   but you're getting a nice combination with  the vanilla creamer so i think this actually   has a little bit more vanilla creamer in  it compared to the cinnamon but at the   same time i am liking the combination because  this premium roast coffee is a pretty banging   situation my first time having it over here  taco bell at least in iced form so pretty good yeah pretty nice order ahead and pick yours up  at our contactless drive-through so rating-wise   really quick on this one i'm gonna have to give  the iced cinnabon delights coffee a pretty solid   8 out of 10 guys i'd probably rock that one  again but i'd like it even more if it was on happy   hour i mean $2.79 is a little bit on the pricier  side for something like this considering how long   the cup is it's fine and i guess you had to pay  for that license because it's the official name   but even still very very tasty very refreshing and  on a beautiful day here in southern cali right now   it's definitely going down very easy i'm  digging my surroundings as you can tell   it's really beautiful out here today all right so  do me a quick favor drop some comments down below   let me know if you're going to be giving this iced  cinnabon delights coffee a shot over here at taco   bell i'm very curious to know if you're going to  be giving this one a go along with the cinnabon   delights i mean that combo really is beautiful and  i can see why they advertise it that way on the   board it really is a beautiful pairing but drop  those comments down below let me know if you're   going to give this one a shot and with that this  is Ian K closing out another high quality foodie   feature for you here on peep this out reviews

it  comes to this iced cinnabon delights coffee and   especially with the cinnabon delights together  like i said that pairing is pretty awesome and   while i'm very glad to have gotten the 2-pack
