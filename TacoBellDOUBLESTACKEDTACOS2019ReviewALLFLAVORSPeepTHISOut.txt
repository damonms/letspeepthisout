 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty Taco Bell rounds out 2019 with the return of one of its best value menu items ever and this time we've got some updated flavors so let's take a look at the double stacked tacos as we round out 2019 here at taco bell and initial first impressions this is still a lot of food for three bucks guys each one of these is a dollar apiece so a lovely situation there I've got all three flavors lined up for you here we're gonna talk about obviously the differences with each of these but first the similarities these are all going to be the same type of build we've got that warm tortilla on the outside with the crunchy hard shell taco on the inside separated with a cheese sauce and then naturally the main ingredients from Taco Bell are all on the inside as well we got some seasoned beef shredded cheese lettuce and a nacho cheese sauce and the only difference is going to be the main theme of what each of these is so starting off with a nacho crunch let's take a look on the inside here and obviously the main draw with this one aside from those ingredients we've got some crunchy red strips all along the inside of this one here to give you that crunch and then as we head over to the chipotle cheddar this one's got gets a little bit of kick on the inside with that chipotle sauce here so as expected a little bit of goodness all along the very bottom of this one here and of course all those are the main ingredients but the real star of the show and as far as I'm concerned probably gonna be the main event for sure it's gonna be the Reaper Ranch one and guys this has a lot of that Reaper Ranch sauce on the inside so a lovely situation indeed and like I said for a dollar you can't hate on these things here with the cheese on the inside of these with that hard shell taco and then the soft taco there as well a very lovely situation I hope these stick around for a bit as they look amazing it's the double stacked tacos for 2019 here at Taco Bell 2020 actually we'll say cuz it's going into the new year let's peep out this flavor yeah these look just as tasty the second time around and I definitely have some high hopes for them considering the flavors we're gonna take a look at right now but if you're curious to see what the original ones were like take a look at that review popping up on your screen right now that was a lot of fun to put together so here we go let's start off with that nacho crunch this is pretty much the only holdover from the last time it's brand new here at Taco Bell technically late 2019 let's do it mmm crunchy cheesy well we're not reinventing the wheel with this one all the same Taco Bell flavors are on display with this the seasoned beef exactly the same as what you'd expect the nacho cheese sauce the shredded cheese the lettuce the crunchiness exactly what you'd expect from Taco Bell if you were to bite this blindfolded you know exactly what it is pretty tasty yup nothing too outrageous with this one it's pretty much the classic Taco Bell Taco wrapped up in a nice one tortilla with a little bit of nacho cheese sauce to separate the two and then naturally for good measure as well as added crunch we've got some red tortilla strips in here so pretty tasty for what it is but it's exactly what you'd expect as well as the flavor of it yeah this is pretty much the starter version of these double stacked tacos here at taco bell and dare I say it the quintessential flavor of what they offer minus the sour cream because that's pretty much everything you'd expect from Taco Bell that hasn't changed over the years let's see if we can move on to the next one though very curious to see about this chipotle cheddar and obviously I think I know what to expect with it let's see if we can go for a little bit of heat action with this one here we go mmm that's already a step up oh that's nice oh yeah mmm I got a nice concentrated blast of that chipotle sauce in that first bite and instantly it melds perfectly with everything on the inside of this naturally the textures of the crunch as well as the nice softness of the outside of it everything together at one time with a decent amount of heat guys this is actually pretty tasty and of course a concentrated blast of that chipotle sauce is gonna be a lot more front-loaded initially and that was really the case with that first bite guys a very nice amount of heat up front along with the familiar flavors of the Taco Bell tacos here and naturally with the crunchiness the softness the textures of both really really nice combination which brings us what I think should be the icing on the cake when it comes to these new versions of the double stack tacos here let's give this one a shot guys it's the Reaper Ranch version and I'm very excited to get into this one here we go mmm creamy ranch flavor on that there comes out heat right away very rich on this one easily my favorite Wow that is pretty amazing and again another concentrated blast of that sauce weather Reaper Ranch is really kicking in right now wow it is really picking em but man the flavor is pretty awesome on this pretty cool and I'm only saying cool because the experience is pretty awesome right now the heat on this one is absolutely elevated above the Chipotle version as you'd expect it to be but it's by far the most flavorful of the three with a very solid amount of sizzle to go with all those classic flavors from Taco Bell easily a favorite guys and for a buck absolutely you can't hate on this one you know I get why they're offering three versions of these naturally choice is good and considering how packed these are for a dollar each it's a very very solid value of course but if you ask me you know what they probably should have done with the Reaper Ranch version considering this really is the highlighted item on the menu as far as I'm concerned they probably should have added some of those red strips by default because for advertising I think it would have looked really cool not sure that sauce has a nice tinge to it in terms of the redness but then on top of the extra redness of those chips that would be a pretty lovely situation indeed but hey I guess you can always add it for that extra charge but I just think for default it would have been just a little bit different to have something like that initially from the get-go and as for the Chipotle version I'm pretty surprised they actually brought out something like that in addition to the Reaper Ranch because they're pretty similar except for the heat level I think the last time out it was like a sweeter option they had as well something hot something sweet the standard version from those original double stacked tacos but this new version it's two versions of heat along with that standard crunchy version of the original but still tasty stuff all right so rating wise let's start off with a nacho crunch version of these double stacked tacos for that one I'm gonna have to give it just a nope a 7 out of 10 this is exactly what I expected it to be nothing more nothing less a little extra crunch but all the familiar flavors of Taco Bell in a very very solid package and again for a buck you can't hate on it it's still pretty tasty and as for the Chipotle cheddar because it's definitely a step up from the OG nacho crunch that one's gonna get the obvious 8 out of 10 because it adds just a little bit of sizzle to what's already a very tasty double stacked taco to begin with hey if you like a little bit of spice on whatever you get here at taco bell this one's definitely gonna be right up your alley it's not too overpowering whatsoever but it adds just the right amount of sizzle so still very tasty but when it comes to the Reaper Ranch variant that one is definitely gonna be my favorite obviously guys and I think you know that by now so that version's gonna get the easy 9 out of 10 a very solid amount of heat and nice creaminess to that sauce as well and the overall blending of all the other textures together an amazing situation if only by default it had those red crunchy strips that would be an amazing thing but hey next time around I'm probably gonna get it that way easy recommendation now of course the obvious question is are you gonna give any of these a shot and hey if you've actually had any of the versions the first time around which one of these new ones are you most excited to try drop those comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K closing out another episode

new version of the value menu here at Taco Bell I think everyone's gonna have an opinion on what they think is the best item on it but for me obviously it's easily gonna be the double stacked tacos
