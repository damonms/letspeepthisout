 hey everyone I'm back at it this time headed into Sonic America's drive-in to check out one of their all-new King's Hawaiian club sandwiches and since I've already ordered one through the mobile app let's hit that drive-thru real fast to scoop it up welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty hurry into Sonic for the Kings Hawaiian chicken or burger club yes Rosen peep this out I've got a mobile order pick up for Ian for one of the Kings Hawaiian burger clubs ah no it was a mobile mobile order just on the app but the stalls are kind of full so I didn't want to pull into a stall oh cool alright thanks alright it is super packed here right now so we're hitting the window direct yeah it was uh looks like a king's Hawaiian burger club oh I did I did there was actually no stalls to check-in it was a mobile order yeah Ian yeah thank you awesome thanks so much stay frosty you too buh bye alright guys let's peep this out here we go with the Kings Hawaiian burger club in initial first impressions it's just a little smaller than I was expecting compared to the picture but not too bad guys looks like about a medium sized roll here with that King's Hawaiian goodness let's pop the top on it and see it's actually very soft very nice looks like plenty of chopped lettuce we've got some of Sonic's signature sauce that they're calling here looks like a tomato slice is buried there let me see if I can dig a little further in pretty decent amount of crispy bacon guys it's actually looking really really nice and that's sitting on top of some natural Swiss cheese looking nice there as well and of course the star of the show besides the King's Hawaiian it's gonna be this meat patty that we see on the very bottom here I'm thinking it's maybe a little less than 1/4 pound it doesn't really feel like a quarter pound burger a little bit on the thinner side let me see if I can lift that to show you yeah it is definitely thin but looking pretty good it's got all the things you'd expect to have on like a club sandwich here just with that beef patty there 100% beef in effect looking really nice and I think that should all go pretty nicely with the King's Hawaiian bread itself so let's see if this one delivers it's the King's Hawaiian burger club here at Sonic America's drive-in let's peep out this flavor so are you a fan of high quality delicious looking food

you know now that I think about it this is a little small for five bucks guys but let's give it a go it's the Kings Hawaiian burger club here at Sonic well already the stand out is gonna be the King's Hawaiian bread and I was hoping for that guys because King's Hawaiian is definitely awesome the crispiness of the bacon goes amazingly well with it and then the light sweetness that I'm getting from their signature sauce is coming through the beef so far a little on the dry side not super flavorful but let's keep going well as I'm getting further into this one the King's Hawaiian bread is beginning to flatten out just a bit but the flavor is definitely awesome on it guys King's Hawaiian bread is absolutely one of my favorite types of breads it goes very well with the crispiness of the bacon and there's plenty of a Thomas burger and naturally the signature sauce is a real standout so just on its own this is pretty much like a glorified BLT but with a meat patty or chicken patty your choice and I have to say I really think I should have gotten the chicken one because the beef is not really standing out it's a little on the bland side and not very juicy whatsoever but all the other flavors pretty nice I'm not really getting any flavor from the Swiss cheese but it does feel very creamy as I'm eating everything guys but overall it's really those stronger flavors that are really taking over this one and again I really wish the meat was just a little bit stronger just in the flavor department by itself maybe in the thickness category too because I think for five bucks you want to have at least maybe quarter pound of beef on this one it doesn't really feel like I'm having that at all still tasty though but hey I am a fan of bacon as I think most of you guys are as well and that's one thing they've done extremely well with this burger today let me pull a little piece off here it's nice and crispy nice and tasty hmmm a nice and crunchy too one more bite then we'll finish this one out well I was really hoping the burger itself would have shined just a little bit more brightly to really combine with all the other nice flavors on this King's Hawaiian burger club guys but as it stands it's just okay everything else is really doing its job pretty nicely I love the bacon again I wish the Swiss cheese was a little bit stronger but the sonic signature sauce goes very well and when you add in that King's Hawaiian bread a very nice combination although I can't help but wonder if the chicken would have been just the better way to go what can you do though right well it looks like I have yet to sink my teeth into a thick juicy burger here at Sonic but fortunately everything else on this particular one worked very well aside from the thinness of that beef patty and the lack of flavor that it apparently had everything else like I mentioned earlier in this review really stands out it is a tasty burger I just wish the actual burger in the name stood out but guys King's Hawaiian is definitely the highlight like I said on top of that signature sauce and the bacon and it is tasty just for that I think it's worth it just for that if you ask me but for me personally I wouldn't go much above $2.99 for something like that and I know it's a brand name burger I know it's the King's Hawaiian name but $4.99 for a burger that literally feels like a values type of patty that's definitely no bueno in my opinion but still the flavor was ok so with that said I'm gonna have to give the King's Hawaiian burger club here at Sonic America's drive-in just a halfway-decent 7 out of 10 and I really can't go much higher than that guys because like I said everything else was really firing on this one with the exception of the meat just really not being there literally not being there guys it was just too thin if the meat with a little bit juicier and definitely thicker this would have been much closer to a 9 because all the other flavors do work pretty nicely but the lack of that meat and the above-average price point really hold it back just a little bit but hey that's just my opinion now how about giving me yours drop some comments down below do you agree with my assessment of the King's Hawaiian burger club here at Sonic and if you've had this one already did you have a similar experience drop those comments down below and definitely let me
