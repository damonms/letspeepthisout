this chicken sandwich is not gonna let me guys the cheese game is strong on this here no matter how you look at this here there is a lot of goodness as you can see a lovely situation plenty of applewood smoked bacon just sticking out for you right there but that pretzel bun is really setting this one off x marks the spot and i gotta say very very excited to get into this right now but

with the beer cheese and that muenster cheese and the outer coating of the chicken instantly right away a little bit of the saltiness a little bit of the flavorfulness coming through but wow it's such a pasty cheesy feeling that i'm getting and of course it's set off with the textural deliciousness of that pretzel bun itself but guys juicy chicken on this one i think i may have saved the best for last guys nothing against the burger i had a blast checking that out take a look at that review popping up on your display right now if you haven't seen that one this is really really good and like i said earlier the chicken game is pretty awesome over here at wendy's i think we can all agree on that this is pretty banging so far let's keep going yeah definitely no joke with that muenster cheese along with that beer cheese combination that is a beautiful situation and when you add in the nice acidity snap and crunch of those pickles to go with it another lovely situation and of course the smokiness of that honey mustard as well as the smokiness from the applewood smoked bacon i think wendy's knows what's up with this and as you can see thick juicy white meat on that chicken fillet in the bottom guys a beautiful situation just beautiful man i just knew this was gonna be delicious and i have a feeling a lot of you guys did as well i mean how can you go wrong with all the ingredients that this one has simply swapping out the protein for chicken and you're really getting pretty much the same experience but with a juicier type of meat believe it or not this chicken is actually pretty much up there with the fresh never frozen beef that i had a few days ago this is actually really really good let's keep going in that's really good yeah this is the quality chicken fillet that completely upholds the reputation of the chicken game over here at wendy's and i got to say guys very very solid and as you can see again just no shortage of goodness with this one here every bite is flavorful you're going to get a little bit of everything in just about every bite here and there's just so much of it aside from the crispy onions believe it or not which are adding just a little bit extra on the back end mixed in with everything else just a beautiful situation but guys again just a lovely sandwich i'm glad the pretzel buns are back these need to stay on the menu a lot longer six years is a long time to keep these pretzel buns off the menu wendy's just so you know you really got to keep these around a little bit longer considering i did a version of this about six years ago this actually is a much better version of that naturally because there's so much more on it and with everything that it's got with the juiciness of that white meat on top of it the home style breading just everything about it really really sings so one more bite we'll finish this one up after the rating but guys i think you already know what the rating is going to be on this one and it is completely worth it and i think you're going to agree with me seriously one more bite we'll finish it out well the pretzel buns are back over here at wendy's and they are definitely fantastic let's do a little 360 action just to round this one out and as you can see again lots of goodness here guys there is no shortage of toppings and overall that beer cheese the muenster cheese combination along with that smoky honey mustard that combination is amazing add in those pickles the crispy onions the apple with smoked bacon it's just insane as you can see swap out the protein for whatever you'd like here a burger or chicken you're going to be satisfied either way it is very well done so let's get right to it the pretzel bacon pulp chicken sandwich here at wendy's is going to get a rock solid 10 out of 10 there is really nothing wrong with any variation of the pretzel sandwiches over here at wendy's depending upon your preference for beef or chicken you have a lot to look forward to because it's a major showcase of not just the quality of the beef and the quality of the chicken over here wendy's but those toppings that are all premium and there's so many of them guys as you can see in that laundry list in the beginning and all throughout there's a lot to enjoy and like i said it's really set off on top of that with the textual nice doughiness if i can call it that of the pretzel bun because it's got a little bit of doughiness it's got a little bit of firmness it makes it very very unique and the flavor is just it just delivers guys it just delivers all right so now the all-important question after this trifecta of wendy's reviews which is going to be your personal favorite which one do you think you're going to be looking forward to try the most there is it going to be the burger variation is it going to be the chicken variation is it going to be just the fries drop some comments down below and let me know your thoughts on any or all of these entries
