 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty what's going on everyone and welcome back to  another high quality foodie feature for you here   on the channel where this time i'm over at sonic  america's drive-in to check out their tie-in with   shark week for their all-new shark week slush and  truth be told this couldn't come at a better time   considering the time of the year it's heated  because it's summer but it's also shark week   so guys the tie-in is perfect so without further  ado i'm going to be very careful with this one   feast your eyes on all that strawberry  goodness and three great whites that   are swimming around the very top of this  one this is looking pretty cool already   so while i'm sorry to say this is not a clear cup  what's actually in this is icy blue coconut slush   topped off with real strawberries and it looks  like a few gummy sharks in the very top there   guys looks pretty awesome and i gotta say aside  from looking awesome this is really playing upon   my fears of swimming in the ocean considering how  much red is on the very top of this right now so   let me pull out the straw here and wow this is  already feeling kind of thick already in the   bottom let's give this a shot real quick it's the  shark week slush over here at sonic let's do it lots of coconut flavor on that with a little bit of strawberry goodness at the  very end only because i got that from the straw   going into it but pretty nice yeah that is really really tasty ultra sweet  and honestly i was kind of expecting the slush   to be kind of like a blueberry situation  because of the color of it naturally   but even still be the artificial version  definitely a lot of coconut flavor in this absolutely let me bring this forward for you  just so you can see it the real strawberries   in the top are really adding to this overall but  aside from that i'm really digging the accent of   the gummy sharks in the very top of this one guys  and like i said it looks like they're circling   in the water there's blood in the water naturally  so that's why they're here but i'm really digging   the flavor of this on top of the appearance  let's keep going in mmm absolutely it's sweet   but the strawberries kind of cut it believe it  or not because they're not as sweet as the very   bottom with the coconut flavor it's kind of giving  me vibes of like a pina colada type of situation   but i like it it's good hmm and because i'm  curious i've got a spoon here off to the side   let me lift up one of these sharks here with a  little bit of that strawberry action actually we   don't want him flipped on his back because that'll  actually put him to sleep but you know what maybe   that's a good idea because then he'll stay still  take a look at that guys very cool let's give a   shot of the gummies here with the strawberry  pretty nice situation already here we go wow because it's so cold this gummy is almost  like a rock oh man this is working my jaw big time   but i like it yeah the sharks are kind of  giving me a blueberry vibe so i guess that   makes sense and honestly when you mix that with  the coconut action and the fresh strawberry action   that you're seeing here this is very very nicely  done guys really nice with the real strawberries that is very good all right  couple more sips on this one   and we'll round it out but very very  tasty i'm glad i finally gave this a shot absolutely definitely digging that and i have  a feeling i'm going to put this one out on the   last day of shark week which is the 18th on  sunday so if you guys are watching this on   the 18th or shortly after try and jump on over to  sonic and give this a shot if you haven't already   this is very very tasty mmm yup sonic shark  week slush all right very tasty on this one so   with that said i'm gonna have to give the all new  shark week slush here at sonic america's drive in   a pretty decent 8.5 out of 10 i was  really hoping i was gonna like this and thankfully   i really do actually it's really delicious but  then again sonic does specialize in drinks so   i wasn't expecting anything less this is a very  nice presentation the gummy sharks are little on   the chewy side but even still the quality overall  is very delicious the blueberry like flavor that   i'm getting from those sharks on top of the  strawberry goodness that was mixed with them   and even the mine was kind of flipped on his back  he was asleep he didn't see what was coming it was   really a beautiful situation guys nice coconut  flavor and again a pina colada vibe actually   i'm really digging that just a delicious drink all  right so just a couple of quick questions for you   first and foremost are you going to be giving this  one a shot and second how impressed were you to   learn that great whites can actually leap out of  the water when that air jaws episode aired so many   years ago i'm very curious to hear your thoughts  on that one who knew that these things can torpedo   from the bottom and catch prey up and jump out  of the water that was completely ridiculous how   impressed were you when you found that out drop  some comments down below and definitely let me   know and with that this is Ian K closing out  another high quality foodie feature for you here   on peep this out reviews bringing you brand new  content every single week here on my channel so i   while you stay tuned for that next review coming real soon in  the meantime stay frosty way to go playing off on my   fear of swimming in the ocean with this one sonic  every time i looked at the top of this one it's   reminding me of chrissy getting eaten by bruce the  shark in the original jaws i'm still not over that   alright guys until next time i'll talk to you  soon hey thanks for checking out another one of   my reviews but just in case you didn't see the one  before this one you can find it right up over here   along what i think youtube's gonna recommend  for you to check out as well as always i think   you'll find something like in both of them and  i'll definitely catch you in the next one see ya
