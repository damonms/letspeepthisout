 hey everyone welcome back to another high quality  foodie feature for you here in the channel where   today i'm over at jack-in-the-box to check out  the latest version of their popular cluck sandwich   that's right and this one's looking a little bit  more heated than usual too so stay tuned because   the blazin cluck sandwich is up next welcome  to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty so here we go with the latest cluck over here at  jack in the box the blazin cluck sandwich and   already this one is looking pretty threatening  with that sauce that you can see on the top and   bottom of that crispy chicken fillet guys  i have a feeling i'm in for a little bit of   a heated situation with this one all right so  let's pop the top of this brioche bun and take   a look underneath and it looks like we have  a nice amount of crunchy pickles along with   jack's spicy good good sauce aka their spicy  mystery sauce and of course that's where that   blazin goodness is gonna come from mostly and  i'm definitely digging the color of it as it   sits on top of their spicy white meat chicken  filet and as you can see it's definitely bigger   definitely crispy and it really fills out this bun  pretty nicely guys this is looking pretty large   and i'm really digging the presentation of  that alone that is actually really really nice   underneath it looks like we've got that second  portion of jack's spicy good good sauce i'm really   digging that name by the way but as you can see  with the chicken patty itself guys again on the   bottom a very lovely situation very crispy and it  smells very fried in the car as you'd expect it to   all right so let's see if the heat's  going to deliver on this one this is   the all new blazin cluck sandwich here at  jack in the box let's peep out this flavor   yes sir not just on the top with that good  good sauce and again i'm really digging that   name we've got it on the bottom as well so you're  going to get coated from top to bottom with this   one on top of that chicken which is looking  really nice and it's supposed to be spicy on   its own but guys the presentation is looking  pretty great on this so without further ado   let's not waste any more time this is the all-new  blazin cluck sandwich here at jack let's do it crunchy wow right off the break i thought i  was getting a little bit of vinegar type of   heat something like in buffalo sauce  but this is actually more of a cajun   type of burn so it's actually not too bad  it's kind of resonating in the background   but it's noticeably more elevated than the  regular spicy version that they've got here   hence the name blazin i guess but  guys the quality of the chicken   is pretty awesome it is a really thick patty on  this one and i have to say again they all try and   emulate the popeye's chicken sandwich this one is  pretty good and with that sauce and the pickles on   top of it i am definitely digging this already  let's keep going in guys not bad not bad at all mmm thick chicken too pardon my manners i'm  all talking with my mouth full but i had to   get that out there guys because as you can  see that white meat is on point this is very   thick and it looks like there's more white  meat than breading which is really awesome   so you're getting a nice mouthful with this  one and that burn as i'm talking right now   is still hanging out in the background so i'm  definitely digging the quality of this already   good good sauce aka their spicy mystery sauce  is very adequately named guys because it   really is pretty good i'm really digging it it  really really sets off the tone with this one   and of course it's a quality chicken sandwich that  i'm having here right now so that definitely helps   and you know what also helps the fact that this  bun is super soft right now guys i am really   digging how spongy this is this is very fresh  although it looks like it's kind of cracking away   it's very very soft almost catchers mitt style  and i have to say it's really encompassing this   chicken pretty nicely i am really digging  this today this is pretty good and i also   got to say i'm glad i'm checking this one out and  adding it to the jack-in-the-box playlist because   i've reviewed every single version of the cluck  sandwich since they've launched these and i have   to say this is definitely up there in terms of  the spiciness i like the fact that it's a little   bit more elevated than the regular spicy variant  but guys like i said the quality of the chicken is   speaking volumes to me right now let's keep going  in for another couple on this one pretty solid mmm wow i got to keep showing this to you guys  the quality of the chicken sandwich today is off   the chart this is one of the best versions  that i've had over here at jack in the box   and again just look at the meat in the middle  of that one there very hearty and price point   wise it's not too bad at $4.79 just a little bit  above the four dollar price point that you'd   expect to see from the other guys but this one is  really delivering very very delicious and again   it's set off with the softness of the bun the  quality of the sauce the crunchiness of the   pickles and the overall semi juiciness of the meat  itself with that light coating which is not taking   up a good chunk of the chicken filet i'm really  digging that there's a lot more meat than regular   coating with this very solid and also coming back  to that good good sauce real fast it's actually   very prevalent all throughout this review right  now guys it's a light burn that i'm getting in   the background after the initial upfront flavor  so it's pleasurable on top of it and you can   actually taste everything along with the snap the  crunch and the acidity as usual from the pickles   very nice combination this blazin don't let  that name scare you it's just a little bit   more spicier than usual but it's very nice  and it complements the sandwich very nicely   alright so let's go for one more bite on this  one before we wrap the review up with the rating   coming up next but guys a very quality chicken  sandwich and again the presentation is just crazy   so let's just round it out really quick and i'll  show you one last time before i take that bite   a lovely situation indeed and let me just say  again i'm really glad i'm doing this today did   i mention that to you today yet okay i lied i'm  gonna give you one more shot of this close-up   after i take this next bite so let's just  finish this up and go for it guys very tasty the initial presentation of this one was very  photogenic guys and as i'm getting further into   it it has definitely got the bite to go with all  the barking that it's doing this is really really   solid in terms of the overall quality that i have  here a very solid piece of white meat chicken   and of course with that sauce from top to bottom  that's adding a little bit more heat than usual   i'm definitely digging that along with the  pickles a lovely combination of goodness today   and something i'd highly recommend you check out  if you've got jack in the area very well done on   this one order on uber eats postmates and grub  hub well that one definitely came correct with   a trifecta of goodness today guys the appearance  was definitely banging it was very photogenic   and of course the crunch that it had on top of  that with that meat in general was very amazing   and naturally the flavor overall along with the  sauce and the way everything combined together   just really satisfied the overall expectations  of what i was hoping this was going to be today   and honestly when it comes to a chicken sandwich  from fast food even though the price point's a   little up there it's still super super delicious  and well worth giving a shot like i said if you've   got jack in the area so because i just want to  confirm it for you overall i'm going to have   to give the all-new blazin cluck sandwich  here at jack in the box the obvious 10 out of   10 because guys there is nothing they could have  done better with that one today the presentation   like i said was amazing and everything across the  board delivered the flavor was definitely off the   chart and like i said even though the price  point's a little up there it's easily worth   your time if you've got jack in the area it's  great to have choices out there when it comes to   chicken sandwiches and that is a bangin choice i  would highly recommend it definitely give it a go   all right so i'd venture to guess if you've made  it this far into the review you're probably going   to be giving this one a shot so do me a quick  favor drop some comments down below definitely   confirm that for me if you are gonna give  it a go and when you do give it a shot   what did you personally think of it along  with comparing it to the other versions of   the cluck sandwiches that they've had over here  at jack in the box since they've introduced them   drop those comments down below and definitely let  me know and with that this is Ian K closing out
