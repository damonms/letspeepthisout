 what's going on everyone welcome or welcome back  to the channel it's Ian K where today i'm over   at little caesars to take a look at what appears  to be a new flavor of their tasty looking cookie   dough brownie that's right it's their cookie  dough brownie with twix cookie bar pieces so   stay tuned because it's up next welcome to  peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty all right real talk if you're starting off with  a chocolate brownie topped off with some cookie   dough as far as i'm concerned you are winning  already but when you top it with some candy   goodness like twix guys i think we're in for  it right now feast your eyes on exactly that   the cookie dough brownie with twix cookie bar  pieces and guys this looks fan freaking tastic   alright so the top of it looks good but going  into what the rest of this has clearly what you're   seeing here is their awesome chocolate brownie and  again very very moist looking and it's definitely   sizeable and again topped off with cookie dough  frosting a very lovely situation there to hold   all the goodness that you're seeing on the very  top guys there is a plentiful amount of the twix   cookie bar pieces and i gotta say even though this  is cut into four pieces it looks pretty long and i   have to admit lots of tasty goodness it looks like  it's super sweet but guys you already expect that   right i mean come on look at what this is this  is looking pretty awesome yes sir and you know   what it's been a minute since i've actually  had twix so to have it on top of a chocolate   brownie right now i think this is going to be  pretty decadent i mean the caramel goodness the   chocolate on its own anyway guys very very nice  and just as expected it is very gooey wow let   me lift this up very carefully here that frosting  is definitely thick as you can see as it focuses in   look at all that guys look at that the focus is  definitely locked in right now take a look at all   that twix goodness as it is dropping down below  lots of it on here guys let's give this a shot   this is super moist it's almost falling apart  here right now but it's cold and i'm digging that   here we go guys it's the all-new cookie dough  brownie featuring twix cookie bar pieces guys a   mouthful of a title but i think this is going  to be a mouthful of deliciousness here we go oh oh sweet whoa the cookie dough right  away the brownie and there's the caramel   twix goodness wow this is crazy flavorful  and again super sweet man the right side of   my face is like freaking out right now but you  expect that right i mean look at what this is   man this is crazy rich guys and of course  like i said you're going to expect that with   something like this but as it begins to focus  in again there is a plentiful amount of that   cookie dough frosting in there guys but it's very  sticky very gooey and very very decadent in terms   of flavor it's really standing out and i gotta  say a little bit more pungent in terms of the   chocolate flavor than the mini m m's version that  they've got here this is actually pretty nice and   the caramel has a nice duality with everything  else on it but man is it sweet let's keep going   in guys i am really liking this and of course the  cookie dough like i said is so strong on this on   top of the softness of the brownie which by the  way again take a look at the moistness that just   looks amazing right there guys you can really  tell it's nice and cold in my hands even though   it's kind of congealing just a bit together  here but i'm digging it let's keep going in man one piece is all you need of this i'm serious dense rich super sweet and very very tasty if  you're a fan of twix you obviously know what to   expect with this one that cookie wafer goodness  the shortbread goodness of the twix itself is   crushed all on top and along with the chocolate  and that caramel drizzle that i feel like it's got   there as well you can kind of see it a little  bit this is really very well done on top of   that familiar cookie dough flavor and the  moistness of the chocolate brownie guys very   decadent like i said but it is definitely worth  your time to check out this is really tasty   yeah let's go for a couple more bites on this one  guys because i feel my energy level already going   through the roof right now i kind of feel like  i want to run around the block maybe a couple of   hundred times because this thing is super sweet  i'm amped up with it right now the sugar is high   but it is very tasty very delicious and again i  do like this one better than the m&m minis that i   checked out not that long ago which was the first  version of this this one i gotta say works very   well and honestly i think they've opened up a  whole new dessert product line using different   candy bars on top of this type of brownie with  the cookie dough there's so much you can do with   this and honestly i'm holding out hope for a  snickers variant that's probably gonna be the   ultimate for me because i dig snickers so let's  go for another couple on this one guys very tasty so soft so good very rich and i'm so glad i'm  doing this in the shade right now because guys   honestly as i'm getting further in this is really  beginning to kind of form something different than   a square in my hands right now but again because  of how soft and rich and buttery tasting it really   feels along with the frosting and the candy bar  goodness from twix i'm not minding it whatsoever   so very very delicious on this one all right so  let's go for one last bite in this one before   we wrap the review up with the rating coming  up next but guys a very nice upgrade over the   m&m minis even though that one had a really  really nice crunch to it because of the actual   physical minis themselves with the m&ms i'm  really digging the fact that this has a little   bit more in terms of overall flavor because it's  not just chocolate in a candy shell you're getting   actually caramel you're getting crushed cookie  pieces chocolate on top of the cookie dough   and the chocolate brownie sign me up guys  one more bite we'll close it out hang on all right here's some more drill worthy goodness  for you guys take a look at that one more time   again plenty of that crushed with goodness on the  very top you can tell they spare no expense with   the amount of twixts on the top of this and when  you add that on top of the cookie dough and of   course the softness of that brownie itself guys  i gotta say this is just a lovely situation all   around and again so rich so decadent very  sweet but you'd expect that for what this   is this is easily worth your time if you're a  fan of twix guys really really good pizza pizza   man i am so amped up on sugar right now so jumping  right to the rating i'm gonna have to give this   all new cookie dough brownie featuring twix  cookie bar pieces over here at little caesars   a rock solid 8.5f out of 10 guys just  be warned it is crazy sweet but the flavor is off   the chart twix is definitely shining through  there's no shortage of it on the very top   and it mixes so well with the actual cookie dough  frosting the duality with that on top of the nice   soft chewiness of the actual chocolate brownie  underneath it guys a very lovely situation this is   easily a banger and again hopefully signaling  different versions of that down the line with some   other candy bars again i'm holding out hope for a  snickers variant at some point so little caesars   if you're watching this right now please make that  a reality it definitely is something i really want   to try on that pretty awesome all right so  i've got two quick questions for you first   and foremost are you a fan of twix like i always  say i venture to guess if you've made it this   far into the review chances are you probably are  but aside from confirming that for me down below   what do you personally think of this particular  brownie is this something that you'd like to try   and is it available in your area drop some  comments down below and definitely let me know   and with that this is Ian K closing out

real soon in  the meantime stay frosty yeah definitely crazy   decadent with the flavor on this one guys and i'm  so glad to have given you a look at this one here   on my channel but again i'm really holding  out hope that we've got some other versions   of these down the line please please please  again for the 5 million time little caesars   bring a snickers variant this is screaming to be  done
