all-new grilled buffalo chicken papadia in what's easily a very toasty situation just like the previous versions before it guys that pizza dough that's baked to perfection and then fold it over with all the goodness on the inside and in this case lots of buffalo sauce so far as you can see there is no shortage of it here we've also got some ranch in there to go along with it along with white meat chicken onions and a three cheese blend so a lovely situation guys and i gotta say it looks really really nice for dipping of course i had to go in with the garlic sauce but not just any garlic sauce we're going spicy so guys i got to match it up right i mean it makes sense so let's see if the flavor is going to deliver on this one because i have a feeling the heat is gonna it's the all new grilled buffalo chicken papadia here at papa john's let's peep out this flavor yeah you know it makes total sense that they would come out with a spicy variant of their popular papadias and

delicious goodness over here and i gotta admit guys this looks really really tasty look at that no shortage of buffalo sauce on the inside of this and of course with the three cheese blend and that

grilled buffalo chicken papadia here at papa john's let's do it oh vibrant buffalo on this wow sizzle's coming up there's a lot of cheese actually that's really good yeah right off the break i'm getting a lot of lovely buffalo flavor with this one and of course with that three cheese blend on the inside that is adding some denseness to it on top of it the nice juiciness of the chicken itself and guys the onions believe it or not are standing out amongst all of this as well very lovely situation and of course that toasty pizza dough that's folded over very lovely situation on this guys and as you can see super colorful with all that buffalo sauce let's keep going it's pretty tasty man you know naturally as i'm getting a little bit further into this one i'm beginning to sweat just a little bit more but not just because of the buffalo sauce it's strictly because of this massive heap wave that we have here in southern cali but guys i got to admit it's fun having this in this degree weather right now considering the flavor that i'm going in on here and i gotta say again combination of all that goodness is very well put together and as you guys can see aside from the pretty simple ingredients list here there is a decent amount of that buffalo sauce that's kind of spread throughout this right now before they fold it over and then split it down the middle for you there but guys a very tasty situation overall and easily a very tasty spicy papadia so let's go for one more bite of this one because absolutely coming up right after that we got to go into some spicy garlic guys you know i had to pair it up so one more bite real quick and then we'll get into that but guys very tasty all right i think you guys all know that the garlic dipping sauce here is my absolute favorite of papa john's so when it's cooked up with a little bit more spice then you're gonna add it with the buffalo how bad could this really be guys let's give this a shot here let's get the nice bottom of this coated nicely and give this a go and go we shall hold on oh my god that is amazing that is amazing guys when you pick this one up and i know you're going to skip the regular garlic sauce and go with the spicy variant because wow that is beginning to kick even further in the back of my throat here right now the buffalo sauce actually comes alive with it a little bit more than on its own and it's good on its own believe me i'm really tasting some beautiful goodness here right now but that ranch in the background is not even existent when it comes to all the buffalo almonds and when you add the spicy garlic on top of it that is a lovely situation let me just bring this a little bit closer for you here this is nice very very nice but very messy make sure you have something under you like i do right now to protect yourself oh yeah all day long man no joke i am blowing fire right now in my car with the heat being elevated on top of it this is a lovely situation i'm gonna go for one more bite real quick because guys i don't think i can really handle too much more of this with the heat that i'm dealing with at the same time this is incredibly delicious with the spicy garlic really good all right no joke i'm seriously beginning to lose my voice here right now so we got to do this one quick for the wrap up but as you guys can see a lovely situation with all the buffalo sauce on this there's really no shortage of it whatsoever and i think you're gonna be pretty satisfied if you're a fan of that type of thing i definitely am and this is a beautiful situation here the toastiness of that crust on the outside the dough is awesome and i gotta admit everything on the inside is very well put together the onions the three cheese blend i gotta admit again really solid there and of course the juiciness of the white meat a lovely situation guys easy recommendation on this one for sure better ingredients better pizza better than a sandwich papa john's yeah this one easily ranks up there is one of my favorite papadias so with that said i'm gonna have to give the all-new grilled buffalo chicken papadia here at papa john's a rock solid 9 out of 10. guys with that spicy garlic dipping sauce it's a 10 out of 10 but all the flavor delivers on that one the ranch i got to admit is just a little non-existent considering how vibrant the buffalo sauce is on this and you're going to notice it right away when you bite into this one guys it's very very flavorful in that regard and then the heat begins to build once you dip it into that spicy garlic here comes pizza nirvana right there for you guys papadia nirvana i should say just a great pairing and i can't impress it upon you enough make sure you get the spicy garlic dipping sauce to go with this there's no other way to have it as far as i'm concerned truly delicious stuff truly okay so before i melt away here one quick question for you are you gonna be giving this one a shot drop those comments down
