 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty what's going on everyone it's Ian K back again  with another high quality foodie feature for   you here on peep this out reviews cheaters cam  style after hours back on over a jack-in-the-box   because after checking out their double chili  cheeseburger recently i noticed they also had   some pretty tasty looking french toast sticks on  the menu as well and judging by this three-piece   order that i've got here right now this actually  kind of looks like the picture guys nice and   crispy what we've got here are three pieces  of french toast fried to a crispy golden brown   and i gotta say they're looking really really nice  take a look at the texture on that nice color on   this one very authentic and the smell in the car  is very reminiscent of funnel cake believe it or   not this actually smells really good and obviously  with this being french toast you got to have some   syrup to go with and in this case we've got  some pancake syrup so i'm really looking to get   into this right now guys because it's looking  pretty tasty so let's not waste any more time   on this one it's the all-new french toast sticks  here at jack in the box let's peep out this flavor   well i have a feeling this is going to be kind of  a quick review i mean after all it's just a french   toast stick but not just any french toast stick  a pretty well made one if you ask me guys take a   look at that golden color the texture looks really  really nice it's really crispy and that smell in   the car right now that aroma is really coming  up on like the funnel cake vibe that i'm getting   here and i'm really digging that this actually  looks really good okay so real quick before i   bite into this one and like always if you guys  are

drops every week here we go guys we have   got a very awesome looking again french toast  stick although it doesn't have powdered sugar   i was really kind of hoping it would let's see how  the flavor is going to be on this one let's do it   mmm crispy oooo that's a nice denseness wow this is actually really good quality believe it or   not that funnel cake vibe is warranted because  this really feels like funnel cake batter guys   i mean look at that on the inside let me try and  focus that for you it's very dense very rich and   i have to admit i'm really not missing the fact  that this doesn't have powdered sugar although i   think that would be a nice add-on accent to this  but super crispy and that flavor is nice a little   bit of cinnamon that i'm getting with this one  but man if you're like in the mood for a funnel   cake and you just want something quick to kind of  you know scratch the itch this is pretty good if   you've got a jack in the area these french toast  sticks are pretty tasty let's go for another bite   and they're crispy and crunchy can  you hear that that is really good   yeah i am already feeling this right now this  is actually really tasty so let's see exactly   how it's going to be with some of their pancake  syrup here i have a feeling this is going to be   pretty good hopefully it's going to be not too  sweet initially because that's actually got   some pretty nice sweetness anyway because of the  crispiness that it's got on top of it but let's   give this a go with the pancake syrup there look  at that really soaks it up nicely nice situation   could be a little bit thicker it's just a little  bit watery as you can see there nothing really too   overly thick but naturally that flavor i'm hoping  it's going to be solid because the aroma you can   really get that maple action coming through  that actually smells really good let's do it oh yeah oh yeah that flavor is there  very sweet on this though man   that's almost grit your teeth type of  sweet i really wish it was dialed back   just a little bit but it's kind of  overpowering the flavor of this but   the flavor is amazing together on it guys as  you can see a lovely situation on this one oh yeah definitely a treat let me kill  this last little piece here real quick   hmmm yeah that is really really good you know if  my memory serves me correctly i've actually never   seen french toast sticks here at jack-in-the-box i  think it's the first time that they've had these i   could be wrong so drop some comments down below  if they've actually had these in the past i've   never done them but i have actually done french  toast sticks at other places most notably bk   and carl's and from what i remember the bk one really  wasn't that great but the carl's version i think   they were called french toast dips actually had  powdered sugar and they were very very thick   and i really enjoyed that so the powdered sugar  really adds to these things actually i'm really   surprised they don't actually have a little accent  with this but the flavor of what it offers in   general really takes this one up a notch really  tasty guys so let's go for another dip on this   one one final dip and as you can see again not  bad for a buck 50 guys this is actually really   tasty and again the thickness is on point  with these here let's go for one more bite gotta be careful with that syrup though i wish  it was a little bit thicker but super sweet but   i'm not going to hate on it too much because the  flavor is pretty awesome so guys one final look   at this one here a very nice quality french toast  stick and i got to say a lovely situation here in   terms of the overall crispiness and that vibe that  i'm getting from funnel cakes i got to tell you   is really there so this is really scratching the  itch for that and i'm really digging the quality   because as far as fast food french toast sticks  are concerned this is really delivering in terms   of overall flavor and that's really where it  counts order on uber eats postmates and grubhub   yeah that's a pretty tasty little breakfast treat  that's going to be available all day long here at   jack in the box while this promo's going but if  you've got a little bit of a bigger appetite and   one little bit more it's actually part of a jumbo  breakfast platter that comes with your choice of   either grilled sausage or hickory smoked bacon  along with some eggs and a hash brown so guys   not bad for five bucks on that one and considering  it's a buck fifty for three of them you're getting   a pretty decent value for that five dollar promo  but i really wanted to give this a shot on its own   to check out the quality and i'm really glad that  i did i only wish it had a little bit of powdered   sugar on the top but honestly guys that's a little  bit of a nitpick because the quality in general   is solid it's not trying to mask anything  with the sugar if it had it because on its own   it delivers the flavor is good so with that said  i'm going to have to give the french toast sticks   here a jack-in-the-box a pretty rock solid 9  out of 10 the only way that i can see to improve   this one aside from a little bit of powdered sugar  as a little bit of an add-on which would be nice   is to really dial back the sweetness of that  syrup just a little bit and maybe make it just   a little bit thicker but as it stands really on  its own guys it's quality as you can see that   the crispiness on the outside i love the golden  coating on it and overall it's dense and it's got   a funnel cake vibe that i absolutely appreciate  because i love funnel cake so i'm easily going   to be getting this one again as a snack guys a  buck 50 for three of those all day long pretty   good all right two quick questions for you first  and foremost are you a breakfast person because if   you are i think you're gonna dig these honestly  drop some comments down below how do you feel

you've got jack in the box in the area are you  gonna be giving this one a shot i'm very curious   to know so do me a quick favor line up that  comment section down below and let me know what's   up
