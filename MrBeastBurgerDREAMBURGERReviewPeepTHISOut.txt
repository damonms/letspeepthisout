 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty hey everyone welcome back to another high quality  foodie feature for you here on the channel where   this time i've ordered up some mr beast burger to  check out his latest promo which happens to be a   collabo with fellow youtube content creator dream  so without further ado let's get it going guys   feast your eyes on the appropriately named dream  burger and i gotta say i am really loving what i'm   looking at here right now this is looking pretty  thick and i'm loving the appearance of it already   so let's pop the top of what looks to be this  toasted bun here and take a look underneath and   it looks like we've got a few pickles a little  bit of that smashed avocado though i wish there   was just a little bit more of it but guys take a  look at what it's sitting on right there we've got   a double portion of bacon and that's looking nice  guys looking really really great of course you've   got the main star of the show along with it those  double smash patties we've got american cheese   a very nice situation they're very large and  i'm digging the appearance of those as well and   underneath it it looks like we've got even more  pickles and some mayo and i gotta say guys the   pickle situation is on point because i am a fan  absolutely but even still what i've got here is   looking pretty awesome and i gotta say this looks  like a really awesome really nicely made double   cheeseburger let's give this one a shot to see how  the flavor is it's the all new dream burger from   mr beast burger let's peep out this flavor you  know when looking at the ingredients list of this   one it looks like i'm missing some lettuce but i'm  not gonna fault them too much because everything   else is looking pretty awesome and considering the  pickle game top to bottom i am absolutely loving   that guys this is looking really good and it  smells pretty awesome in the car right now as well   all right so let's get this one going it's the  all-new dream burger from mr beast burger here we go first off what i got right away was an  overabundance of seasoned beef guys this   is actually really really tasty let me just show  it to you real fast here i didn't get too much of   anything else just yet but as you can see it  is a loaded double cheeseburger and i got to   say very smash burger-esque in terms of the  patty flavor really really nice seasoning a   little bit of elevated salt on it but man it is  absolutely meaty for sure let's keep going in the pickle game is strong as you'd expect it  to be having him on the top and the very bottom   of this burger but the avocado although i do  wish i had just a little bit more of it it's   beginning to kind of dovetail in there in terms  of the flavor it's nice and creamy but guys again   the over abundance of the beef on this one is  the main star of the show on top of the pickles   it is a really really awesome double cheeseburger  as you can see here and the bacon is beginning to   come through as well but guys a lovely situation  indeed just take a look at all that meat   and the green is definitely standing out and  hey i guess that's supposed to be the point   considering dream is technically green i mean  he's primarily known for minecraft and speedrun   videos so i see the angle they're going with this  one here but let me just keep showing this to you   the green aspect is really standing out although  again i do wish there was just more of that avo   i was expecting a nice double portion on this  one but considering everything else that's on   here the pickles are more than making  up for it and the deliciousness that is   the beef patties around that are on this burger  is really shining through i am absolutely   digging the flavor of the mr beast burger  in general pretty tasty let's keep going in yeah i'm definitely getting beast style vibes for  my original review from mr beast burger when   he first launched these and i have to say i  am digging it already there and that actually   dovetailed right back into the crispy chicken  tender sandwich that i reviewed shortly after   was pretty decent flavor on that one as well but  as for this collabo what we've got here is a very   tasty double bacon cheeseburger essentially  guys with a little bit of avo again i wish i   had a little bit more of it but thankfully a lot  of pickles which is really really nice and the   mayo i'm not really tasting but everything else  that's on here is shining through the seasoning on   that beef is pretty awesome a little bit saltier  than i would probably like as well it's a little   bit up there but the overall flavor is awesome  it's gonna make you thirsty i can tell you that   and i really do wish i had a drink here right now  what are you gonna do and sidenote i gotta say i'm   really digging the promo packaging for this one  as well this is a little bit of a keepsake that   i think i'm gonna keep in the studio i'm really  digging the overall box with this one guys a   really really cool little sticker of dream on the  outside and i am really digging the overall promo   art that we have on this one here of course the  classic mr beast action very very slick and of   course it comes in that custom bag with the mr beast  sticker on the outside a lovely situation indeed   so let's go for one more bite on this one we'll  close it up after the rating but guys again a   very very lovely double bacon cheeseburger and  a very nice one at that considering everything   it's got on it again i wish i had just a little  bit more avo i know i'm beating it to death but   i really thought this was going to have a lot  more because they're kind of advertising it that   way but thankfully again we've got plenty of  pickles one more bite we'll close this one out well you can never get enough money shots of  awesome looking food in hd guys and of course   i love bringing it to you and as you can see again  a lovely situation with the amount of meat on this   one that green is really standing out you can  see that avo in the very top there it's kind of   centered in the very middle and that's cool but  what you got here is lots of tasty pickles again   a very smash burger-esque type of burger with lots of  seasoned flavor and a very nice amount of bacon   to go with just a lovely situation all around  on this one guys pretty tasty just open up your   favorite delivery apps and search mr beast burgers  and hey aside from all that tastiness it's nice   to know a portion of the proceeds of these burgers  still goes towards feeding hungry families across   the country so that's absolutely a beautiful  situation the ultimate beautiful situation   because it's fueling a good cause so with that  said i'm gonna have to give the collabo between mr   beast and dream aka the dream burger a rock solid  8.5 out of 10 guys this really did   satisfy the flavor department strictly because  of the seasoning in that beef alone it really   is very similar to smash burger in my opinion and  everything else on that was a lovely situation in   general the cheese was nice and melty the bacon  was fairly crispy although it wasn't exactly a   double portion that i thought as well again the  avo was little light as well on top of that   but plenty of pickles and overall solid flavor  okay so one simple question for you guys are   you gonna be giving this one a shot drop some  comments down below and definitely let me know and   with that this is Ian K closing out another high  quality foodie feature for you here on peep this   out reviews bringing you brand new content every  single week here on my channel so while you stay tuned for   that next review coming real soon in the meantime  stay frosty you know whatever collabo is next for   mr beast i hope we have more promo packaging just  like this one this is actually really really cool   all right guys until
