 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty all right everyone let's get it it's Ian K back  again with another high quality foodie feature for   you here on peep this out reviews this time over  at kfc because they're launching something that   looks to pair up very nicely with their chicken  guys i think this is gonna be chicken dipping   good it's their new kfc sauce and i gotta say  i'm excited to give this a shot with a couple of   their tenders so let's not waste any more time on  this one guys let's see exactly how awesome this   kfc sauce really is yeah it wouldn't be the colonel  without some type of finger looking good reference   right and in this case it's chicken dipping good  and i gotta say this is gonna be pretty cool i'm   already digging the packaging and that little  cartoon colonel right there it's looking really   really cool so we're not gonna waste any more time  on this one guys it's just a sauce naturally but   i'm hoping the flavor is going to be awesome on  it but like always if you guys are fans of high   quality delicious looking food reviews make  sure to hit that subscribe button down below   don't forget to tap that bell icon so you can  be notified as soon as brand new content drops   every week all right the kfc sauce apparently  replacing the finger licking good sauce and it   actually kind of looks like that believe it or not  guys it's got like a little thousand island action   going there let me open this up first i'm going  to give it the smell test we'll show it to you   it's a very muted looking thousand actually it  actually smells like thousand island dressing but   take a look at that there looking very nice you've  got the seasoning goodness right there as well   maybe a little tomato to be honest i'm smelling  a little bit of something different with this one   but we're going to give it a shot with that crispy  chicken tender let's give this a go we'll go for   the dip you guys get the close-up the first look  it's definitely hugging those nooks and crannies   of the coating on this absolutely here let's give  it a go it's the all-new kfc sauce here at kfc almost had a problem it's actually a very vibrant type of tomatoey  thousand island dressing yeah you know what if   you were to blindfold me and tell me this is not  finger linking good sauce i would say you know   what this has to be because it's very very similar  but it is a little bit more elevated the sweetness   is higher but it's a richer type of thousand  island vibe that i'm getting with a little bit   of tomato on the back end maybe some little bit  of spicing actually as well coming through nothing   crazy but it is noticeably elevated compared to  the other but very similar if that makes sense   mmm i like it yeah this definitely feels like  it's a different version of the finger lickin   good sauce and considering they're revamping  their whole line of sauces over here i think   it's the honey barbecue the honey mustard the  classic ranch aside from the regular hot sauce   you've got a lot to look forward to i may  have to try the other ones as well but guys   i'm really digging the quality of what this is  and it definitely has a vibe of thousand island   to it there with maybe a little bit of tomato  and a little bit of spice believe it or not   but it's definitely different but similar it's  like an elevated version of what was basically it's good though it goes really good  with the extra crispy chicken too   all right so let's go for one more dunk on this  one to give you another idea of the thickness of   this one it is noticeably thicker but it really  does hug the nooks and crannies of that chicken   very nicely it's nice and thick nice and rich  and again it's more of like a kicked up version   of that finger licking good sauce with a little  bit of tomato and spice thrown into the mix but   it's very very similar guys but still very very  tasty all right so with that said i'm gonna have   to give the all-new kfc sauce here naturally at  kfc a pretty rock solid 8 out of 10 this is   not gonna change your mind if you guys are used  to the finger licking good sauce but what it is   gonna give you is that familiarity with a little  bit of kicked up sweetness a little bit of spice   and a little bit of tomato thrown in but guys  very very similar overall and still very very   tasty and it obviously pairs very nicely with the  colonel's world famous chicken but you knew that   already right yeah i would definitely rock this  one again considering i do like the finger lickin   good sauce in general so even though that's  officially off the menu right now this is a nice   little upgrade over that and i gotta say i am  really digging the quality of this one especially   with the added spice they add a little bit of  tomato goodness that i'm feeling with this one   as well and of course that familiarity of that  thousand island-like dressing so pretty solid   okay now the obvious question is if you're a  fan of the finger lickin good sauce are you   personally looking forward to giving the new kfc  sauce a shot drop some comments down below let   me know what your favorite sauce is over here  at kfc if it's not finger lickin good sauce   and if you have given this a shot out already  what'd you think drop those comments down below   and
