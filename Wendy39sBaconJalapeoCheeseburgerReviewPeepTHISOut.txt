the very bottom you can see there that's all on top of some fresh quarter pound beef patty action over here as well guys so the single patty is all I went with here by considering the amount of

right off the break that jalapeno sauce and the pickled jalapenos are going to work on me big-time this is heated guys this is pretty nice man yeah that is definitely got some get to it there and it's going very nicely with that fresh beef as well the saltiness is on point the bacon a nice combination so far guys let's keep going mmm and I've got some pretty thick pickled jalapeno slices on this one as well guys take a look at that one in the very top there everything is melding together amazing with this I know it looks kind of messy on your screen right now but look at all the toppings that it's got the crispy onions are putting in work in that category as well they really have a nice aftertaste with everything else but that jalapeno sauce and the cheese sauce along with the pickled jalapenos and the bacon is a glorious situation I didn't think I was gonna like this as much as I am right now but wow it is really really tasty it looked a little small and I unwrapped it but with everything else this has got going on right now I'm almost sorry I didn't do the double if not the triple just to try that but the flavor is amazing the combination of that jalapeno sauce as well as the cheese sauce everything together the creaminess is amazing with it of course the bacon we all know the applewood smoked bacon here Wendy's rocks I think most of us can agree on that but guys the combination of everything together is pretty glorious it's really tasty mmm man that is really good and I actually have two slices of cheese it looks like on this one actually on top of the patty as well as on the bottom plus the cheese sauce on top of that so guys it's a cheeseburger it's taking the name seriously it's doing its job but all the other additions to this one really light this one up nicely they're very very tasty and an easy recommendation I might want to go back and do the double if not the triple if I'm really hungry for it but very very nice as part of bacon fest really is and thankfully it is with some really classic Wendy's beef flavor on top of everything else you see in front of you which as always is very plentiful on the very top of this one I can't get over how much is on top of this burger so don't let me keep you in suspense if you're wondering what I'm gonna be giving this one rating wise because overall I'm gonna have to give the bacon jalapeno cheese burger as part of bacon fest here at Wendy's a rock-solid 9 out of 10 and the only reason it's not a 10 out of 10 is because let's be honest the price is just a little up there for what I'm getting even though the size is small and the flavors big six bucks plus tax is a little much to ask for something like this even though the flavor was amazing and I would recommend trying it at least once I would definitely recommend stretching your dollars out a little bit further go for the double if you're already up at that price point you might as well go big right I probably should have but of course the obvious question is are you gonna some comments down below and let me know what you thought of this bacon jalapeno cheeseburger here at Wendy's did it look pretty delicious to you and if you are gonna give this one a shot are you gonna go with the single the double or that triple drop those comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K closing out another
