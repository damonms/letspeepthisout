chicken sandwich wars that's right so stay tuned because the King's Hawaiian crispy chicken sandwich is up next welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty so a new challenger enters the ring in the form of the King's Hawaiian crispy chicken sandwich here at fatburger and I got to say guys this is looking really thick really stacked take a look at the height on this this is looking really really awesome as you can see on the very bottom that very huge chicken patty fried up nicely pretty much extending out the very ends of the bun here it's more long than it is round and I gotta say I'm diggin that let's pop the top of the kings hawaiian here and take a look looks like 3 fried avocado slices nicely breaded nicely seasoned underneath that looks like we've got a bunch of pickles guys and actually a lot of that sauce there that's Buffalo's express medium sauce and it's drizzled pretty liberally there let's see if we can go a little further in and as you guys can see the size of the chicken patty is pretty huge I mean look at that it is peeking out the back it is definitely looking very specialty and I got to say guys nice thickness overall so let's see if the flavors gonna deliver on this one because it looks like it is gonna satisfy in that first bite alone because of the size of it it's the King's Hawaiian crispy chicken sandwich here at fatburger let's peep out this flavor yeah this thing is definitely thick definitely tall and with those premium ingredients on top I think we've got a worthy addition to the chicken sandwich wars right now guys my only concern though is how over fried the chicken seems to be there as I'm looking at this a little bit closer but guys look at the thickness on that that looks really really amazing and again with those fried avocado slices on the very top adding even more thickness and girth to everything this is gonna be a pretty satisfying first bite I have a feeling so before I hopefully confirm that for

notified as soon as brand-new content drops every week guys here we go the King's Hawaiian crispy chicken sandwich here at fatburger mmm hmm hmm all right first off of course that was gonna be very satisfying because naturally going into a really thick fried chicken sandwich is always a beautiful situation this is no different and I got to say I'm really diggin the ingredients so far and believe it or not the standout ingredient as I was going into that was the Buffalo's Express medium sauce that buffalo type of heat that I'm getting is really a beautiful situation combined with the fried goodness and then as you bite down even further into the chicken you realize guys the combination is beginning to work really well the only downside and as I was fearing is the chicken itself is a little over fried and as you can see right there judging by the outer coating there that's kind of the giveaway not super juicy but flavorful nonetheless and as you guys can see with the pickles coming in the acidity to snap from them along with the fried avocados a very beautiful situation let's keep going with this one guys it's good mmm yeah I gotta say whoever thought about putting fried avocado slices on the sandwich kudos to you absolutely because the creaminess and the crunchiness of the outer coating goes beautifully with everything else on the inside along with the combination of that sauce and naturally with the acidity and the snap and crunch of those pickles as mentioned earlier coming up on the back end it's a nice combination to go into the lightly breaded chicken patty that I've got right there even though it's a little on the overfried side it really works very very well so very hearty to jump into this one and as you can see it's got some height it's got some girth it's satisfying to bite into and guys like I said it's a really really good chicken sandwich and the size is pretty awesome as well thankfully you've got this chicken diaper in the very back just like all the other burgers at fatburger they give you a wrap to go around so if anything does fall out the back you're protected but guys beautiful situation let's keep going mmm man and let me also say the sweetness of that King's Hawaiian bun is amazing King's Hawaiian bread in general is amazing with anything you put it on as far as I'm concerned so when you pair that up with a fried chicken sandwich primo guys just the right amount of sweetness but again I keep coming back to it I'm really digging those fried avocado slices as you can see right there super creamy super rich and there's a decent amount of them in terms of the size only three pieces but they're nice and thick and they absolutely deliver and again I'm really diggin that aspect of this because it's so different you don't see this really on chicken sandwiches from the other guys out there right now because it really is a premium type of thing and naturally with the price point of this one you'd expect it to be a little bit more premium thankfully we've got some topping to go with and again that buffalo sauce a beautiful situation guys let me round this one out with one more bite we'll finish it up after the rating but it is a very very solid chicken sandwich I'm so glad I'm giving this a shot right now aside from the fact that is crazy crispy hot right now in Southern Cali here we go so yes there are pretty nice addition to the chicken sandwich wars right now with this entry from fatburger and I got to say again it is really really solid quality aside from the lightly over fried chicken patty on the bottom the size of it is absolutely awesome and with all those premium ingredients on top along with the King's Hawaiian bread it's a no brainer guys a very very solid addition and one I'd highly recommend you check out so with that said I'm gonna have to give the King's Hawaiian crispy chicken sandwich here at fat burger a pretty rock-solid 8.2 out of 10 the only real issue with this one and as you've heard me mention throughout the review was the chicken patty itself now while it was flavorful as you can tell it was over fried so had this been pulled out maybe a minute or so earlier I think it would have been perfect because with those premium ingredients guys that's the real selling point with this one on top of the King's Hawaiian bread naturally that would have been just over the top if it was perfect that way but as it stands a very delicious chicken sandwich and one that I would definitely recommend to you easily all right so now the obvious question are you gonna be taking me up on that recommendation drop some comments down below do me a favor and let me know if you've got a fatburger in the area and if you do are you gonna be giving this one a shot are you super excited to try the chicken sandwich officially from fatburger with all those amazing ingredients on top drop those comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K
