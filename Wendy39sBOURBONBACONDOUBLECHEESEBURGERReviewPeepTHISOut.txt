summertime themed burger promo so let's  hit that drive through and set ourselves up hi   can i help you hey how are you doing today good  thank you what could it get for you uh you know   peep this out can i try that new bourbon bacon  cheeseburger uh just the burger by itself is a   double and that's it okay it's gonna be $7.71  at the window thank you great thanks so much   yeah you can definitely tell summer is here  because not only is it crazy hot outside right   now but this is the time when most of the fast  food restaurants drop their summertime themed   burgers and barbecue is usually it and i gotta say  this one sure looks pretty good hey how you doing   gotcha yeah this looks good awesome thank you  all right you as well stay frosty we'll see you   bye-bye all right guys let's peep this out  so here we go with the all-new bourbon bacon   double cheeseburger here at wendy's and as always  this is looking like it is going to be a lovely   burger eating situation guys so let's pop the top  of this premium bun and take a look underneath   and starting us off is the obvious we've got some  crispy onions and some of their all new bourbon   bacon sauce i definitely can't wait to get into  that to see what that flavor is going to be like   but as you can see going further on down we've  got plenty of applewood smoked bacon and american   cheese for sure guys another lovely situation  in that department wendy's is definitely on it   with their bacon game this is all sitting on two  quarter pound fresh beef patties as you can see   we've got a half pound of goodness in actuality  here guys and i can't wait to get into this   let me see if i can get a little cheese pull here  in the middle and as you can see loveliness all   around there's nothing in the very bottom of this  one here and honestly there really doesn't need   to be because it's all on top guys can't wait to  get into this one let's do just that this is the   all-new bourbon bacon double cheeseburger here at  wendy's let's peep out this flavor yeah wendy's   definitely knows what's up when it comes to their  beef over here guys and of course you gotta double   up on it at a bare minimum because a single patty  is just a tease but as you can see here again   lots of cheesy goodness the bacon goodness the  onion goodness that's on there as well those   crispy onions are definitely looking and smelling  pretty good i can smell them actually but guys   very hefty i can't wait to do it alright i think  i've said that like two or three times now so here   we go officially it's the all new bourbon bacon  double cheeseburger here at wendy's let's do it yesir right off the break with this one that  bourbon bacon sauce is beginning to shine through   i'm not really getting so much bacon flavor  from that as i am from the applewood smoked   bacon but the sweetness of the barbecue sauce  is definitely there and then it dovetails right   into the beef itself and guys let me just show  this to you guys i love this situation again   like i said you got to do the two patties  at least because a single is just a tease   it definitely makes the heartiness that much  more and when you combine it with all these   tasty summertime ingredients i'm gonna say  this is definitely a lovely situation let's   go for some more bites guys pretty tasty  but i think you knew that right let's go all right let me give you the business right now  with this one guys another shot of this one up   close this time with more to see and as you can  see after that second bite guys it is absolutely   a meaty situation you can really feel like  you're eating a half pound of beef on this one   and everything else in here is beginning to  light up nicely with it there the american cheese   between the patties on the very top the apple  wood smoked bacon guys a lovely situation and   of course the crispy onions as well all in cased  with this nice soft premium bun pretty banging   and man this thing is super hot right now which  is not doing me any favors considering it's   like 90 plus degrees as i'm filming this  here even with the windows cracked guys i'm   beginning to feel it but honestly i don't know  if it's a combination of the heat or maybe the   meat sweats but i'm really digging this burger  let's go for a couple more bites guys but super   delicious and again another banger of a double  cheeseburger over here at wendy's here we go yeah i am definitely a fan of the wendy's beef  for sure guys when it comes to fresh never frozen   the difference is pretty apparent with this one  here i love reviewing over here at wendy's for   that reason especially for the promo burgers  and honestly with all the other ingredients on   here you already know the applewood smoked bacon  they're known for that over here the crispiness is   on point i've got maybe about a strip i guess on  here right now that's really just like one piece   cut in half but that's okay because it's crispy  and super flavorful so yeah not really too much   else to say about this one it's pretty much a very  awesome barbecue themed bacon double cheeseburger   essentially but guys with that bourbon bacon sauce  again it's really more of a heightened type of   barbecue sauce i'm not really tasting any bacon  in that but that's a testament to the applewood   smoked bacon that's on this right now so honestly  guys i'm not minding that whatsoever the barbecue   sauce theme is there it's heated in the car right  now it's summertime it's a western type theme that   we've got going with this one right now and i'm  absolutely digging it one more bite we'll close it   up after the rating but guys again do the double  you're gonna thank me for it pretty delicious so yeah let's go around the world because  why not guys this one really fills out the   bun pretty nicely as you're going to see here  it is absolutely front loaded with all the good   stuff on here the bacon goodness that wendy's is  known for the cheesy goodness that it's adding to   that on top of it and the overall smoke that  i'm getting from everything on here guys is   absolutely delicious the light sweetness from that  bourbon bacon sauce is pretty tasty and again it's   all about that fresh never frozen beef over here  definitely a banger of a double cheeseburger with   lots of bacon goodness so before i melt away any  more than i already am right now i'm gonna have to   give the all new bourbon bacon double cheeseburger  here at wendy's a pretty rock solid 10 out of 10   guys there's really no way that could have failed  unless of course it wasn't made correctly and that   was made pretty perfectly the double patties  absolutely a banger of a situation with that   nice and meaty for sure the melted cheese that  applewood smoked bacon the crispiness of it and   of course the crispiness of the onions on top of  the bourbon bacon sauce which i wish maybe just   had a little bit more bacon flavor but honestly  the sweetness was there i can go on and on and   on with this guys but you already know what it is  encased all that good stuff inside of a premium   bun it's a great send off guys very delicious  stuff okay now i venture to guess if you've made   it this far into the review you obviously want  to give this one a shot so do me a quick favor   drop some comments down below let me know what  you thought of this one and did you actually do   the triple because they do have a single double  and the triple of course available drop those   comments
