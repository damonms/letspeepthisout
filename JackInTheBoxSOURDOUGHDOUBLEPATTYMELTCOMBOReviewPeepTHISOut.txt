right great thanks so much all right i just noticed they had a double so i figured you guys might want to see that over the single and plus i'm kind of hungry $8.41 yeah how you doing today here's your medium diet coke awesome thank you whoop I'm so sorry oh it's okay we got the lid we got the lid caught it before it crashed disaster averted any sauce uh just some ranch please thank you appreciate it all right stay frosty we'll see ya all right guys a little bit of an ordeal but let's peep this out so here we go with the double sourdough patty melt combo here at jack-in-the-box and of course we've got a side of fries and a drink to go with but we're going to be focusing on the main star of the show right over here guys feast your eyes on it the double sourdough patty melt itself some nice toasty sourdough bread there on top looking really nice it's feeling pretty good underneath it looks like we've got a little bit of mayo we've got a slice of american cheese some grilled onions underneath that looks like a little bit more of that american cheese and maybe a little bit more mayo but on the very bottom is a slice of swiss cheese and it is really tight in there but as you can see there it is but not too bad this maybe looks like about a quarter pound of beef spread between two patties they're not overly huge and overall the sandwich is not super big but it definitely looks pretty decent i gotta admit guys this is actually looking pretty tasty let's see if the flavor is gonna deliver on this one it's the double sourdough patty melt combo here at jack in the box let's peep out this flavor so yeah i missed out on this one the first time that it was out and now that it's back in the menu here at jack in the box it's got to be for a reason right i guess a lot of peeps really enjoy this one so i figured why not add this to the playlist and give it a go as being that it is my first time that i'm going to be having this here and i got to admit the presentation is not bad the toastiness of that sourdough looks really really nice guys look at that that is actually legit right there i'm just a little concerned about how thin it is otherwise now considering the price point of these burger combos here jack in the box typically something is going to give and unfortunately the main event is usually a little bit smaller than what they show in the picture but it still looks pretty decent all right so before i hopefully confirm the decentness for you hopefully it's going to be better than decent it's going to be really good if you guys are fans

week guys the double i had to do it for you right now and like i said i'm kind of hungry i really want to go in on it and i'm really glad that i did considering the size of these patties right now let's give it a go it's the double sourdough patty melt here at jack in the box hmm beefy yeah major good call on the double on this one guys just looking at this already and i'm going to give you a close-up in just a second this literally equals about a quarter pound of beef total is what i'm looking at here with the two patties but the overall flavor is good the crispiness of that sourdough is pretty amazing as well and the cheese it's actually fairly juicy which i was surprised sometimes jack-in-the-box tends to be a little on the drier side let's go for a bite and i'll give you that close-up but so far guys not bad yeah those marinated grilled onions are pretty amazing on this guys feast your eyes on the inside there and as you can see about a quarter pound of beef and some cheesy goodness to go with i'm not really tasting the swiss on the bottom but the american is coming through nicely and those grilled onions also a lovely situation and of course with that toasted sourdough action right there that is really really nice so i am really digging this and like i said i'm so glad that i got the double i highly recommend that you guys do as well if you have a jack in the area let's keep going in on it yeah those grilled onions are starting to really kick in right now guys this is actually really good and the creaminess of the cheese on top of it i'll just keep giving you some close-ups here this is just a lovely situation and as you can see a decent amount of onions i was a little worried when i did the initial close-up it didn't look like it had a lot but everything else in this is really singing nicely in the flavor department and again the toastiness of that sourdough is coming through this is a pretty solid fast food double sourdough patty melt guys i'm really digging this right now and even with the fries on the side here which by the way it's a little crispy in the car here right now hang on mmm that is really good i almost lost a drink in the drive-through as you guys saw there but disaster averted glad i've got a cold drink to go with but guys a delicious combination of goodness on this one i'm really digging the overall quality of the beef this time out like i said jack-in-the-box tends to be a little drier sometimes but the quality of everything else in this is really solid and again the highlights are easily going to be the marinated grilled onions on this one on top of the cheese and the swiss i'm not really getting i think that's kind of the glue holding the very bottom of the burger together and i see why they stack it that way because it really sticks to the sourdough bread pretty nicely but guys again a really lovely situation on this one and i would highly recommend getting the double like i said as you can see by the meat here a single is just not going to do it and considering a $5.99 price point here on the west coast it's a dollar more than it was last year i would definitely recommend the extra buck up and get yourself a nice situation here in terms of the beef a nice combination and it's easily a combo that's worth your time for sure order on uber eats postmates and grubhub alright so i think i'm going to jump right to the rating on this one because i don't think there's really anything else i can squeeze out of that detail wise that you really don't know up until this point so with that said i'm going to have to get the double sourdough patty melt here at jack in the box a pretty solid 8.8 out of 10 the only thing i can see about improving on this one is maybe swapping out the swiss cheese for maybe a slice of cheddar or another slice of american and maybe making the thickness of that meat just a little bit larger but guys as it stands not a bad value for what you get but considering the price point it's a little bit more average a little bit more up there it would have been better to have just an overall bigger sandwich for the money but still very tasty and i can easily see why it's back on the menu now all right so now the obvious question for those of you who've actually had this over here at jack in the box already are you personally glad that it's back on the menu drop some comments down below let me know how excited you are to give this one a shot again and if you are gonna get it again are you gonna get it in double form drop those comments down
