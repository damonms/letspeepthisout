 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty hey everyone welcome back to another high quality  foodie feature for you here on the channel   cheaters cam style after hours over at sonic  because it looks like they're about to j-j-jam on it   with a brand new variation of cheeseburger that  could be their most unique yet that's right so   let's go in on it feast your eyes on their all-new  bacon jam cheeseburger and guys i have to admit i   really like the presentation of this one already  but as much as it's supposedly got a lot of bacon   action going with it i'm smelling a lot more onion  than anything else so let's pop the top one what   feels like a soft yet toasted brioche style bun  and as you're gonna see we've got a little dollop   of mayo we've got a little bit of mustard and  we've got a nice little chunk of bacon right there   in the middle and as we pan down it looks like  we've got some residual bacon action on top of the   quarter pound of 100% pure beef guys and i have to  admit it looks pretty decent actually pretty fresh   underneath it is going to be the main star of the  show with this one a sweet and savory bacon onion   jam and guys it looks pretty plentiful i have to  admit i'm definitely digging that and of course   you've got some american cheese to go with so guys  a pretty nice laundry list of ingredients on this   one and i have to admit it sounds pretty flavorful  already and i gotta say considering my last few   experience here at sonic i am really glad this  one is actually presenting fairly decent right   now and again that bacon jam that's got here i  mean it's more oniony than anything else but guys   it definitely smells pretty fantastic and  again one more time a very lovely situation   right there guys not bad whatsoever let's  get into this right now we'll scratch that   let's peep this out right now it's the bacon jam  cheeseburger here at sonic after hours let's do it well right off the break and as you heard me  mention already this is advertised as having a   sweet and savory bacon onion jam and i gotta say  guys sweet is the dominant factor with this one   it's almost grit your teeth type of sweet and  then this very robust onion flavor that comes   out of that but a very lovely situation not  really tasting anything bacon-wise from that   as opposed to the crunchiness of the bacon  on the cheeseburger so it's not bad for that   let's go for another bite and we'll give you  a close-up but tasty guys pretty tasty so far yeah i don't really know about the bacon jam  aspect of this as opposed to the onion jam   that i'm really getting from this with a lot  of sweetness it almost feels like a heightened   type of barbecue sauce to go on top of this  cheeseburger here guys but the flavor is not bad   and as you can see it's a fairly decent  amount of beef that i've gotten this one here   the crispiness of the bacon on top and  everything else with it not bad whatsoever   and it really is not that bad considering again  like i said earlier the experiences that i've had   here at sonic have been hit or miss the last few  reviews anyway but i gotta say this is actually   hitting the mark right now it's just the sweetness  level of that bacon onion jam is really elevated   that's the only thing i'm not really feeling with  this but everything else so far is really singing   but on the reel i gotta be honest guys i'm getting  a huge sense of deja vu right now because as much   as this is unique to sonic this is very similar  to something i reviewed carl's jr back in 2016   take a look at the review popping up on your  screen right now it was something called the   bacon 3-way and i gotta say guys it was  very similar because it actually had a bacon   type of jam as well on top of chopped bacon  and regular bacon so that's where they get in   the three-way with that and while this doesn't  have chopped bacon to go with it's just bacon   and then that bacon jam there i guess this is  considered the bacon 2-way over at sonic but   i gotta admit guys still pretty tasty let's  go for another couple of bites on this one still very sweet i don't know if i'm digging  that i'm almost getting like a very heavily   candied bacon type of vibe with this and i'm  not really digging that as i'm getting further   in here but i got to admit guys everything  else with this is definitely working and again   a lovely situation with the amount of beef  goodness on this considering it's late night   right now i was really hoping this was going to  be fresh and it fairly is as you can see here not   bad for what you're getting the crispiness of that  bacon thankfully is on point i wish it was maybe   one extra strip on here but it's still pretty good  all right so let's go for one more bite on this   one because i think i've gotten everything out  of it that i care to talk about with this one i   think you get the point on where i'm going with  it here the sauce is just very very sweet let's   knock it out one more time we'll close it up after  the rating guys decent though guys kind of fun to   check out right now i do love me some nighttime  filming and i got to say guys when you have a   lot of sauce to kind of show here at the very  bottom it really looks very nice glistening in the   light here a lovely situation let's go around the  world with this one and as you're going gonna see   a fairly decent amount of pure beef on this one  the quarter pound patty here at sonic finally   is tasting fresh for me tonight i'm really glad  i'm having a decent experience with everything   else on this one the cheese is not too bad with  it but again the sauce is just a little overly   sweet for my liking and but it does have a lot of  nice onion flavor so not too bad for that so with   that said i'm gonna have to give the all new bacon  jam cheeseburger here at sonic just a decent   7.5 out of 10 because honestly like I've said  all throughout this review guys it's just not bad   the only problem is the sauce itself is a little  too sickly sweet from my liking and again there's   really not a lot of bacon flavor in that it's  more of just an onion jam really on top of the   bacon that you're getting with the burger itself  but it does work together with everything but like   i said the sweetness is definitely elevated and  that's aside from the fact that i felt like this   was more of like a glorified barbecue type sauce  than anything else but still pretty decent so guys   do me a quick favor drop some comments down below  let me know if you're going to be giving this one   a shot over here at sonic and if you are are you  going to be hitting this one up late night like   i am right now drop those comments down below and  definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K   closing out another high quality foodie  feature for you here on peep this out reviews   cheaters cam style after hours bringing you
