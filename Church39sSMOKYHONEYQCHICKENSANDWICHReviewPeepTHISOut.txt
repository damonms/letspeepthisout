 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty hey everyone welcome back to another high quality  foodie feature for you here on the channel   cheaters cam style after hours over at church's  chicken this time to go in on the latest version   of their all-new chicken sandwich so without  further ado let's get into it guys feast your   eyes on the smoky honey q chicken sandwich and  already i am digging the size of this chicken guys   this is actually looking like the biggest version  of their chicken sandwiches that i've tried yet and   it's looking pretty awesome so let's pop the top  of this toasted yet soft looking brioche style   bun and take a look underneath and as you're  going to see there is no shortage of pickles   guys i'm definitely digging that because i'm a  fan of pickles but with this variant we've got   smoky honey q sauce a combination of barbecue  and honey mustard and i'm definitely down with   that and of course that looks to play nice with a  very solid piece of white meat chicken here guys   like i said this looks like the biggest piece of  chicken i've tried yet on the chicken sandwiches   here at churchs and i'm definitely digging  that nice and crispy and it easily takes up   this whole bun a lovely situation and just to  take a quick look under this beast of a chicken   fillet it looks like we've got more of that smoky  honey q sauce on the bottom there guys so it looks   like a combination of top and bottom goodness  with this sauce and i can't wait to get into it   guys this is the all new smoky honey q chicken  sandwich here at church's chicken let's peep out   this flavor oh and did i mention this looks like  the biggest version of the chicken sandwiches that   i've tried yet over here at churchs guys  look at this filet this is pretty insane   very huge and it almost looks very similar to  the other guys we're gonna leave them nameless   for right now but you know who i'm talking  about a very solid piece of fried chicken and   the pickle situation is definitely on point  guys lots of pickles on this for sure all   right so enough talking let's go for that  first bite in this one to get this review   started it's the all new smoky honey q chicken  sandwich here at church's chicken let's do it easily the biggest piece of chicken wow right  off the break that smoky honey q barbecue   sauce pops with flavor on this one guys  this is a pretty lovely situation and again   it's dovetailing into the size of the chicken this  time out this is easily like i said you're going   to hear it all throughout the review the biggest  piece of chicken i have ever had over here at   churches since i've reviewed the other sandwiches  already take a look at the classic as well as that   spicy popping up on your screen here but guys a  lovely situation with the smoky honey q as good   as those two were and believe me they were pretty  awesome this is definitely the way to go so far   guys that smoky honey q sauce like i said the  combination of the barbecue and the honey mustard   goes a long way and when you have a huge piece of  chicken like i do this time out this is a lovely   situation of course the acidity the snap and the  crunch of the pickles it's adding so much to the   overall package with this one let's go for another  bite i'll give you a close-up guys delicious stuff crunchy breaded goodness that really soaks up  that smokey honey q sauce on top of the pickles   and everything else and the softness of this bun  on top of it guys very lovely situation there but   the chicken itself takes up this whole bottom of  the sandwich the top of the sandwich pretty much   this whole bun as you can see from end to end this  is definitely packed with the good stuff and that   sauce in the pickles go amazing with everything  here which is of course this huge chunk of chicken   that i've got here right now and like i said  i'm so glad that i'm having this because i got   to admit this is really really hitting the spot on  top of everything else right now and i gotta say   it really speaks to the fact of how fresh this is  on top of it that has a lot to do with it because   the juiciness is there and you normally don't get  that with white meat especially with fried chicken   really got to make sure the balance is kind of  there in the cooking process this has got this   right now on top of the size so i'm really  digging this here let's go for a couple more   bites but guys delicious fried chicken sandwich  action after hours of churchs let's keep going in there is a solid portion of that smoky honey  q sauce in the very bottom of this here guys   and it's really soaking up very nicely into the  bottom piece of the chicken so i actually have   a little bit more sauce on the bottom compared to  the top but of course with the pickles on top of   everything else the combination is literally  sandwiched together on top of a really tasty   chicken sandwich in general guys delicious stuff  it really is and that's aside from the fact wait   for it that it's a huge piece of chicken right now  on top of it and again i'm just gonna show this to   you guys i gotta keep giving it to you guys it is  really really delicious the breading on this which   is uniquely churchs just take a look at that  lovely situation it's crispy it's crunchy and of   course all the other goodness on this particular  variant of course they gotta do the smoky honey   q considering i checked out the tenders not that  long ago which again you're probably seeing that   review popping up on your screen here right now as  good as that was together i was kind of thinking   this would be good on a chicken sandwich and low  and behold here we go with it okay so i think   you get the point right now aside from this being  a huge chicken sandwich it's a tasty one at that   and for $3.99 again a very lovely situation the  value is banging on this one the size is banging   especially after hours right now i'm enjoying this  and guys the overall experience is just banging in   general let's go for one more bite we'll close  this one up after the rating but delicious stuff   and an easy recommendation to try the smoky honey  q sauce with the chicken over here at churchs   whether you get it in sandwich or the tenders do  the sandwich it's pretty banging one more bite all right so let's go around the world with this  one and as you're gonna see a very beautifully   fried piece of chicken over here they really do  it up nicely over here at churches especially with   this new variant of their popular new chicken  sandwich of course with that smoky honey q   peeking out the back a lovely situation and like  i said this version is really filling out this bun   very nicely top it off with some really decent  amount of pickles and you've got a winner of a   chicken sandwich especially with this new promo  sauce delicious stuff churchs bringing that down   home flavor so yes i winner of a sauce for sure  and i actually got a little extra on the side just   to show you the packaging on this one again here  guys a lovely combination of the goodness and like   i said it comes very very correct on the chicken  sandwich here so if you decide to get a little   bit of extra naturally that's not a bad thing but  considering the amount i had in the sandwich it's   not needed they did a nice job of putting the  sauce on there pretty good stuff all right so   as if you couldn't tell already i'm gonna have to  give the all-new smoky honey q chicken sandwich   over here at church's chicken a rock solid 10 out  of 10 guys this was a beautiful chicken sandwich   eating experience right now and it was made even  better with this new promo sauce like i said the   combination of the barbecue and the honey mustard  and that smoky honey q is a banging situation   when you have it on a thick piece of fried  chicken like that with some pickles to go with   and the soft light toastiness of the brioche  style bun it's a winner all around especially   when you get it as fresh as i did right  now that's a lovely situation okay so i've   got one simple question for you because like i  always say if you've made it this far into the   review chances are you're probably gonna give  this one a shot and if you do give it a shot   do you think this one is gonna be your favorite  out of the three that are currently out right now   the classic the spicy and this variant with the  smoky honey q drop those comments down below and   definitely let me know and with that this is Ian  K closing out another high quality foodie feature   for you here on peep this out reviews cheaters cam  style after hours bringing you brand new content   every single
