 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty alright everyone let's get it it's Ian K back  again with another high quality foodie feature for   you here on peep this out reviews this time back  on over a good old mickey d's to check out another   one of their all-new mccafe bakery desserts and  without further ado guys let's go in on the apple   fritter and yeah this looks to be a nicely fried  situation we're about to get into here right   now guys feast your eyes on what looks to be a  very nice combination of some doughy goodness   cinnamon and apples fried up to a crispy golden  brown before it's covered in sweet glaze icing   and i gotta say the presentation looks pretty  inviting and the size isn't really too bad for   the $2.39 that i paid for this right now and if  you take a look in the very bottom it's kind of   reminding me of the cinnamon roll that i did  recently so let's not waste any more time on   this one guys let's see if the flavor is going  to deliver it's the all-new apple fritter part   of the new items here at the mccafe bakery here  at mcdonald's let's peep out this flavor well i   guess in terms of portion control this is actually  not too bad considering the size it really kind   of feels like a smaller version of the like the  standard apple fritters that i'm used to seeing   especially like at disneyland they're literally  like three times the size so considering what   i've got here this is actually not too bad and i'm  really digging the presentation plenty of icing on   this one and again the very bottom is really kind  of reminding me of a cinnamon roll for some reason   i don't know why but i'm getting that vibe maybe  it's just the color and the texture of this one   it's not nearly as soft as a cinnamon roll  a little bit more harder but even still   looks pretty good okay so before i bite into this  one and like always if you guys are fans of high   quality delicious looking food reviews make  sure to hit that subscribe button down below   and don't forget to tap that bell icon so you can  be notified as soon as brand new content drops   every week all right truth be told i'm not really  a super fan of fruit on donuts but i have to admit   the smell of this is really enticing me and i think  that has something to do with the glazed icing on   the top so let's give this a shot it's the apple  fritter brand new here at mcdonald's let's do it soft i may be a fan of fruit  on these types of donuts   yeah that apple is subtle but it goes so  amazing with the sweet glazed icing on this   right there as well and obviously with the doughy  goodness on the inside take a look at that guys   that is really nice nice and golden but man the  sweetness it's not really crazy sweet but i'm   really digging the subtleness of the apple on  this let's keep goin i really like how soft it is   yeah i'm digging this right now i don't think  it's going to pull me away from the cinnamon   roll over here at mickey d's which if you haven't  seen that review take a look at that one popping   up on your screen right now that was pretty  heavenly this is actually a nice runner up   and like i said the apple is very subtle so i am  really digging the fact that the sweetness like   i said is not really crazy on it but it really  feels very quality made and that sweet icing   with the cinnamon goodness is amazing on it guys  really really tasty let's go for one more bite yeah this is a pretty nice sweet treat and i can  see why they want you to pair this with some of   their coffee over here guys i mean if you don't  want to get anything really crazy with a cinnamon   roll this is a nice runner up and again the  quality is pretty nice i'm really digging   the overall just the toastiness of everything here  guys i know it's fried and all but it's got a very   nice soft feel and as you go into it that glazed  icing is beautiful so just a beautiful situation   overall and with the subtleness of that apple  coming up on the back end it really rounds out   just a very very tasty item over here very glad to  have checked this one out today well considering   the quality of that cinnamon roll that i checked  out recently i was really hoping the quality of   this apple fritter was going to be somewhat  close to that and guys it actually is i mean   the cinnamon is very similar on it but naturally  the sweet icing is just a little bit different and   overall with the apples being very light on the  back i really love that little accent coming up   there very very solid so coming from someone who  doesn't necessarily like fruit on donuts this is   actually changing my mind to get this one every  once in a while i'm gonna have to give the all   new apple fritter as part of the mccafe bakery  here at mcdonald's a pretty rock solid   8.5 out of 10 definitely satisfies  the itch for something sweet very similar   to a cinnamon roll because of the denseness that  when you bite into it you're kind of getting that   but the subtleness of the apple coming up there  is a beautiful situation and that sweet icing   is primo okay so now the obvious question did  this one actually look pretty primo to you   drop some comments down below are you a fan of  apple fritters in general is this like one of your   go-to items there outside of say normal donuts  i mean naturally everyone's got their preference   but do you really like apple fritters drop those  comments down below and definitely let me know and   with that this is Ian K closing out another high  quality foodie feature for you here on peep this   out reviews bringing you brand new content every  single week here on my channel so while you stay   tuned for that next review coming real soon in the  meantime stay frosty pretty tasty stuff mickey d's   pretty tasty stuff but if i can drop one request  into that comment box just between you and me   how about adding maybe a chocolate brownie to  this collection i think that'd be pretty awesome   alright guys until next time i'll talk to you  soon hey thanks for checking out another one of   my reviews but just in case you didn't see the

them and  i'll definitely catch ya in the next one see ya
