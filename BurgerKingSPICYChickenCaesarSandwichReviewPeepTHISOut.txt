latest promo that's right feast your eyes on the all-new chicken Caesar sandwich here at BK or in this case the spicy version definitely a pretty nice presentation on this one guys there's plenty of chopped lettuce as you can see peeking out right there along with lots of hickory smoked bacon starting off with that potato bun on top of course we've got the little shiny action here let's take a look under the hood looks like we have got plenty of that Caesar sauce guys it's a very strong pungent aroma in the car right now very very nice there we've got shaved parmesan looks like there is plenty of it there a tomato slice and again that chopped lettuce see if I can lift that tomato to give you a better look lots of bacon guys lots of bacon and of course the shaved parmesan is in there as well you've got that crispy patty here the spicy variant a 100% white meat chicken fillet fried up to a crispy golden-brown and it looks like on the bottom of this one more of that Caesar sauce guys this aroma is really strong on this one and I'm really diggin that so pretty an awesome looking build on this one and definitely a very very messy situation have plenty of napkins on hand let's give this a shot it's the spicy chicken Caesar sandwich here at BK let's peep out this flavor yeah lots of nice Caesar dressing aroma in the car right now with some nice notes of garlic believe it or not guys this is a very pungent smelling sauce I'm really looking forward to getting into this right now but before I take that first bite and like I always say if you guys are fans of high quality delicious looking food reviews make sure to hit that subscribe button down below and don't forget to tap the Bell icon so you could be notified as soon as new content drops every week guys it's the spicy variant of the chicken caesar sandwich here at BK let's do it mmm strong sauce that's already starting off awesome already and what's also starting off our ready to go at that sauce is the heat hang on one second mmm Wow spicy spicy hit on that one guys that's actually a very nice combination with the Caesar sauce and I'm really diggin the crispiness of the chicken that goes along so nicely with the bacon I'm not quite tasting the shaved parmesan pieces on this one to shake because the sauce is just so vibrant let's keep going well I got a nice concentration of that shaved parmesan in that second bite and while it does complement the Caesar sauce pretty nicely the main star of the show is just that the Caesar sauce guys the pungentness of that shaved parmesan is not coming through as strong but the Caesar dressing is a huge highlight with this one and as you can see with the chicken on the bottom it's a little on the thin side this time out but you do get a piece in every single bite it does cover the whole button nicely here and the crispiness and the spice is on point very nice combination of flavors on a very simple build with this with that sauce the shaved parmesan and of course the bacon that you see there as well just a nice combination of Hickory saltiness from the bacon and the garlic creaminess of that Caesar sauce really really tasty I don't normally get chopped bacon on my Caesar salads when I get them so I like the addition in these sandwiches because it adds that saltiness which I'm really digging on it it's really really tasty and the fact that I usually get grilled chicken when I get Caesar salad in general you have the option to do that here at BK as well you've got grilled chicken you've got the regular crispy and of course the spicy that I'm doing right now it really does add a nice little kick to the whole party with this guys and I do admit the quality of that spice and the breading is tasty with the overall flavor of this and of course the Caesar dressing very strong as you're hearing me talk about I didn't realize how much shaved parmesan is hiding underneath there guys there is a concentration of these pieces here and these are the exact same ones from the chicken parm that I reviewed a while back as well take a look at that review popping up on your screen right now but these are definitely a nice addition to what's really a tasty chicken sandwich in general yeah nice and strong but not as strong as that sauce it's really good Caesar dressing they're using so let's do a little 360 action to close this one out a decent amount of that shaved parmesan was hiding in the middle of this one and as you can see there's a clump of it guys pretty nice overall just a very very decent quality chicken sandwich here and the fact that it's using Caesar dressing is a nice combination that goes very very nicely with the chicken itself as you make our around you see a nice shot of it right there we've got plenty of chopped lettuce and of course if you guys like tomato you're gonna like this one that much more very decent the bacon is pretty amazing and the crispiness of the chicken itself on point I just wish it was just a little on the thicker side but it does cover the whole bun guys just a nice quality chicken sandwich and if you're a fan of Caesar salads in general definitely give this one a shot it is worth it and hey let me just say the next time out if I go for a Caesar salad I'm definitely be looking for a crispy chicken variant with some spice because that combination of the Caesar dressing and the spiciness the chicken had in this was pretty amazing I really enjoyed that so with that said I'm gonna have to give the spicy chicken Caesar sandwich here at BK a pretty solid 8.2 out of 10 everything pretty much fired on this one and like I said the only main thing is I wish the chicken itself was just a little bit thicker maybe a little bit juicier but overall a very tasty combination of flavors and guys it's Caesar dressing it's one of my favorites now of course the obvious question at least for me anyway is do you think this is personally gonna be one of your favorites drop some comments down below are you a fan of Caesar dressing in general and if you are are you excited to give this version of it a shot over here at BK drop those comments down below
