there let's pop the top on this one oh yeah these donuts are very fresh very hot and feast your eyes right there guys an extra crispy chicken breast fillet all the 11 herbs and spices that the colonel is known for fried up to a crispy golden brown with even more coating as you can see there and obviously the donut on the bottom lemme lift this up here this is very sticky and man just a lovely situation it is steaming up the camera that shows you how fresh it is right there guys looking pretty crazy let's see how this is gonna be flavor-wise how bad could this really be these donuts are very hefty too man this really feels solid so let's get gluttonous with this one it's the Kentucky Fried Chicken and donut sandwich here at KFC let's peep out this flavor so as you can tell this is a cheaters cam review after hours because that's absolutely the very best time to have donuts as far as I'm concerned so the combination of donuts and Fried Chicken together gluttonous as it may be this is super fun to film right now alright so before I take the first bite of this monstrosity because this looks and smells pretty fantastic if you guys are fans of high-quality delicious looking food of

goodness that's in my hand here right now it's the Kentucky Fried Chicken and Donuts sandwich at KFC after hours here we go first bite mmm oh my god oh my god oh my god all right first things first this absolutely smokes the chicken and waffles forget the chicken and waffles this is where it is at right now guys the thickness of these donuts the crispiness of the chicken the juiciness of the chicken how hot everything is the glazed goodness on top of it I don't really know where else to begin with this one I think I've given him a mouthful already but guys it's super insane and let me just say I am super thankful for this quote-unquote burger diaper in this case a chicken sandwich diaper on the very back of this because this thing is loaded with glaze I can see why they gave me a fork with this one I'm not using it I'm gonna do it caveman style but guys this is truly insane let's go for a quick bite of this one again we'll definitely view another one of these close-ups but let me just say it super crazy delicious and you knew it would be right let's go for it mmm oh my god crazy crazy alright let me just say this is one of the hardest things I've ever filmed in my car for a review ever right now on my channel guys this thing is so sticky it's so wet my hand is completely drenched behind the sandwich here right now but as you can see the donuts are very fluffy super fresh super warm and of course you've got that chicken on the middle right there guys 11 herbs and spices the goodness that you know from KFC but man the flavor is insane it's just savory it's sweet its crispy crunchy really really juicy and the fluffiness of those donuts are off the chain this is just delicious stuff and man I am so glad I've got like a ton of napkins around me here right now this is just insane with the amount of glaze all over the place guys so you really need something to hold this with I can see why they give you a fork to go with this one I'm probably doing it in a way that's a little bit more difficult obviously but they really want to eat it like a sandwich but guys there is so much glaze everywhere it's just insane guys I'm really loving the presentation of this one and just how fresh it is this is just really really awesome let's go for another bite and keep going with this one because obviously I really want to let's go mmm you got to go slow it's so freaking good dangerously delicious you know when I first saw this was coming out I was really surprised there wasn't any sauce options that you'd probably want to go with with something like this but considering the glaze on the donuts you don't really need it because it is so sweet so rich and it really really kind of makes your teeth grit just a little bit but in the best most possible way but that combination of the sweet goodness goes amazingly well with the crispy chicken patty on this guys so honestly you're not gonna need any sauce with this and there really is no need for it considering how sweet the donuts are but just a nice accent of the chicken and those crispy colonel herbs and spices in effect with this one I don't know what else to say about this except it's super gluttonous super delicious and again it blows away the chicken and waffles this is easily the new high water benchmark for a mashup gluttonous sandwich especially from KFC this is insane guys one more bite we'll finish this one out with a rating after the wrap-up but lemme just say really really good guys really good mmm and again you gotta bite it slow trust me you know I think I timed this review perfectly right now because tomorrow is a gym day for me so considering the amount of sugar that's in that right now I'm pretty much gonna be bouncing off the rafters I think I'll be able to get through my sets pretty quickly shouts out to KFC for giving me a couple of these wet naps in the bag I'm telling you you guys are gonna need these this thing is loaded with glaze but like I said in the best most possible way you want to have a very heavily glazed donut there's no shortage of it on this guy's probably almost up there with the cinnabon rolls that they had a while back those cinnabon biscuits I got to say pretty amazing guys it really was but this one is easily one of my favorite hybrid mashup sandwiches especially from KFC even more so than cheetos sandwich guys and aside from all the other fun stuff I reviewed in the past there's something so simple about just really heavily glazed donuts and crispy fried chicken it's gluttonous but the combination is amazing and again it blows the chicken and waffles out of the water I don't really ever want to have those ever again after taking a couple of bites of that much less after the first bite but hey listen if you don't want to get your hands dirty you can always go for the regular platter version as well which is very similar to the chicken and waffles in terms of presentation you've got three chicken tenders and a donut or you have the bone and chicken to go with as well and if you want to say make your own version of the sandwich in that basket for an extra buck you can add another donut so that's still not too bad so as if you really need me to confirm it for you score wise for this one right now I'm gonna have to give the Kentucky Fried Chicken and donut sandwich the obvious 10 out of 10 guys there's nothing wrong with this it's exactly what it advertises it to be super fluffy super warm glazed donuts very heavily glazed I might add as you've heard me say throughout the review and a really nice piece of chicken to go with and the combination works extremely well but again bring plenty of napkins bring a whole tube a whole roll of paper towel something you're gonna need it guys trust me it's crazy really really delicious and I'm so glad I checked this out especially after hours right now the perfect time to have Donuts at least in my opinion all right do me a solid real quick as always drop some comments down below let me know what you think of this one in particular and how excited are you to give this one a shot I mean the combination of donuts and chicken it really seems like a no-brainer considering the waffles but how excited are you to try this mashup of glazed savory sweet crispy crunchy juicy drop those comments down below and definitely let me know
