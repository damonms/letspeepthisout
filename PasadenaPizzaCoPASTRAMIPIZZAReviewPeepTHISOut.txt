 hey everyone it's another high quality foodie feature for you with Ian here on peep this out reviews this time at the pasadena pizza company to definitely go in on something you're going to want to see and for me to absolutely want to try on camera of course so stay tuned because the pastrami pizza is up next welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty so here we go with the pastrami pizza from the pasadena pizza company and initial first impressions a very lovely amount of pastrami on the top of this one guys this is looking really really good and in terms of the size this is a small but it's actually maybe just a little bit below a medium that you get from the other guys as well so pretty decent there what we've got here is a pizza topped off with obviously pastrami we've got some pickles mustard and mozzarella cheese that's it and i gotta say i am really digging the amount of pastrami on this one super hot in the car right now lots of aroma from that pastrami jumping off really really nicely i got to admit i'm really digging that pizza crust right there that's looking really really good let's see if the flavor is going to deliver on this one because it absolutely smells fantastic it's the pastrami pizza here at the pasadena pizza company let's peep out this flavor alright real quick just to give this review a little bit of context to let you know what i'm going through right now i'm actually in the middle of a crazy heat wave here in southern cali so it's well over 100 degrees outside of my car at the moment so inside the car even with the windows slightly cracked as you're seeing right over here it is just as hot if not hotter with a breeze it's kind of blowing hot air into my face I literally feel like I'm in the oven with this pizza right now and as awesome as this looks i don't want to waste any more time on it guys we got to get to it but real quick and like always before i take the first bite of this one if you guys are fans of high quality delicious looking food reviews make sure to hit that subscribe button down below and don't forget to tap that bell icon so you can be notified as soon as brand new content drops every week guys the pastrami pizza from the pasadena pizza company take a look at that thick slices of pickle on that as well no sauce it's just mustard pickles pastrami and the pizza dough along with the cheese so let's give it a shot oh yeah first off the mozzarella cheese is very rich and flavorful this is actually really really good and i have to admit when you combine that with the mustard on top of it you're getting a little bit of that bite action to go with and then the saltiness of that pastrami and guys the pickles don't get me started yet the acidity and the snap slightly that i'm getting they're warm pickles naturally but the flavor is coming through but put that on some really really decent pizza crust right here this is a pretty lovely situation right now aside from the heat that i'm in right now with the sauna in my car let's keep going oh yeah i am really digging the pastrami to pizza crust ratio in this one it's the perfect balance and when you combine that with the mustard with just enough bite and then of course those pickles that's a very lovely situation but guys very very flavorful and honestly i'm not missing any tomato sauce on this one and i guess you can't really call it a pastrami pizza if it's got tomato sauce this really does feel like an open face pastrami sandwich just done an italian-style way yeah this is really really tasty and the good thing also to know is that this pizza is available outside of the area where i live from other pizza companies it's actually a chain of them that basically adopt the city name into their titles so we have like the monrovia pizza company the sierra madre pizza company the duarte pizza company those are all surrounding cities to where i'm at right now and naturally having the same type of menu roughly the same pricing as well goes a long way and the fact that you're getting mom and pop style pizza it really feels like it's not fast food type pizza this really feels a little bit more authentic and i gotta say guys again delicious let's keep going with this one man and you know another really awesome thing about this pizza right now is the fact that the pickles are not small these are thick cut slices of pickles that i'm having on this pizza right now and they add so much to the overall bottom lime that combination with the mustard and of course the creaminess of the cheese goes a long way and the saltiness of the pastrami itself guys it's delicious as you saw when i popped the box on this it's littered with pastrami all over the top so i'm not minding the smaller size compared to a medium from the other guys but at the same time the quality is very much up there so at fifteen dollars for this yes it is on the pricey side but when it comes to this one right now i'm absolutely getting what i'm paying for so one more bite of this one and then we'll close this one out after the rating because guys i'm dying in the car right now let's go all right so let me do a 360 for you here with another one of these slices and as you can see nice quality all around and again that pastrami to pizza crust ratio is a beautiful situation along with the amount of pickles that are on here and the size of them guys just a lovely situation indeed and the crust nice and toasted it's really made perfectly and i got to admit i am really digging the overall quality of it but when you combine it with everything on top with the cheese the mustard and those pickles along with the pastrami guys this is actually worth the money for 15 bucks even for a small it's really tasty so with that said i'm gonna have to give the pastrami pizza here at the pasadena pizza company a rock solid 9 out of 10 now believe me i was very concerned about this one price wise and i was like for 15 bucks this better really deliver and thankfully it did and as you saw the combination of those ingredients guys i mean it's a simple ingredients list the pastrami the mustard the pickles which you'd expect to see in a traditional pastrami sandwich of course but when you add the traditional stuff aside from that minus the sauce a.k.a the pizza crust and the cheese guys a very lovely situation indeed and well worth the money i can honestly say because of the quality that it delivered all right so i've got a couple of questions for you first and foremost have you ever been to any of the pizza companies here in southern california no matter which city you live in do you guys actually have one of these in your area and secondly is this something that you think you'd want to try regardless of the price anyway drop those comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K closing out another high quality foodie feature for you here on peep this out reviews bringing you brand
