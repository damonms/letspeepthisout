 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty looks like Popeyes releases nationally its first dual dipping sauce for its latest promo and it just so happens to include one of my favorites so here we go with the $5 double dippers and as you guys can see we've got a nice box of fried goodness from Popeyes as always looks like about five or six of those boneless wings they're coated up very nicely all the Louisiana seasonings as usual we've got a biscuit on the side and if you're wondering where the actual side is I'm supposed to get with this guys I'm wondering that myself I was supposed to get some red beans and rice but it's nowhere to be found so all we've got is the chicken and the biscuit and we have a side of parmesan ranch dipping sauce which is a really really cool little combo action that we've got going here and again one of my all-time favorite dipping sauces the ranch looks really good we've got some crumpled Parmesan to go with and I'm very excited to see what this is gonna do overall flavor-wise it really looks and smells pretty tasty actually so let's not waste any more time this is the $5 double dippers combo over here at Popeyes let's peep out this flavor so are you a fan of high quality delicious looking food reviews well if so definitely hit that subscribe button down below and don't forget to tap that Bell icon so you could be notified as soon as new content drops every week now let's dive into this so this is gonna be a quickie for you today guys because I have reviewed plenty of Popeyes Chicken on the past to know that there is no difference between these wings that I'm going to take a look at and anything else pretty much that I've already reviewed so take a look in the upper right hand corner of your display there are plenty of Popeyes reviews for ya but just to show you really quickly here nice and meaty nice and golden as you can see nice and crispy let's take a fast bite of this one and then we'll go for a dip into that parmesan ranch its crispy its Popeyes Chicken not too juicy this time out though but it does have a decent amount of heat as I was expecting a pretty decent amount of white meat along with an equally decent amount of spice to go with the crispy coating on this one and nothing too unfamiliar but still tasty nonetheless okay so let's go for a dip into that ranch along with the parmesan and I got to admit I really like the little container this comes with I was wondering how they were gonna do this but I like the fact that it's actually split in half let's go for that dip alright so we got that creamy ranch goodness a very decent amount on one side and let me try and flip this around for ya and we've got the parmesan crumbles in there as well looking really really crumbly I can say that they give you a decent amount of a guys and it's very pungent but very nice on that two-tone there let's give this a shot visually it does add something pretty cool to the mix compared to the normal just single type of sauce that you're normally used to getting with Popeyes but I like a two-tone on this one guys with my all-time favorite ranch and the parmesan here we go mmm very strong pungent flavor on that parmesan for sure and the nice tang that I'm getting from that ranch it's almost like a Romano like a stronger type of parmesan but the crumbles are plentiful guys and that ranch again you need something like that to really kind of help scoop up some of this stuff there so it kind of clings to it but tasty very tasty mmm let's do that again because this is really fun guys I have to admit the standard dip I'm used to it feels the same way the nice creamy ranch and then when we flip it around you have a nice little container of the parmesan to go with there let's get a little bit more of that in there I'll try and get as much as I can but a very decent amount they gave you and as you can see that double-dip action is on point very nice you do realize I'm just doing that for the excuse to go for it again right mmm you can't blame me though yeah that's pretty awesome and I'm glad they're starting off with ranch and Parmesan as the introduction for this type of thing because I have to admit the combination works well it's a nice little pungent flair from the parmesan and the richness of that ranch is awesome I'm already looking forward to what else they're gonna come up with in the future because this is really pretty good so one more quickie close up to close this one out here guys its ranch its Parmesan crumbles it's on top of the coating from Popeyes and it's delicious all the way around a very fun combo for five bucks if only I would have gotten aside to go with but what I do hope happens again is me getting back on over to Popeyes not only to get that extra side that I should have gotten the first time around but to definitely go for this one again because like I said that combination of ranch and the parmesan crumbles is primo very tasty so with that said I'm gonna have to give the $5 double dippers here at Popeyes a pretty rock-solid 9 out of 10 at its core it's still the same popeyes chicken that I know and love and especially with that ranch thrown into the mix the flavor is very familiar but the addition of that parmesan I do have to say really takes it up nicely but of course that's gonna naturally segue into me asking you do you agree with me drop some comments down below do you think this 2 dip concept is something that Popeyes really needs to run with or would you rather see them come out with just some different sauces as they've done in the past drop those comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K closing out another episode of peep this out bringing you brand new content every

well as try it you know we're going for the biscuit with this guy's so let me get a little bit of ranch on this and a little bit of that parmesan crumble action how bad can this really be buttery flaky goodness with that ranch and Parmesan let's do it mmm instant instant pungent parmesan buttery flakiness the ranch oh yeah mmm let's do it again double dip baby amazing okay I need some quality
