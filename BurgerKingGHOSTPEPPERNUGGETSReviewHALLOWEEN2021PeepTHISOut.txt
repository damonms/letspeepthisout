 what's going on everyone and welcome  back to another high quality foodie   feature for you here on the channel  where this time i'm over a good old   bk for an advanced look at some fun  halloween goodness coming your way   that's right you already know what it is  it's their all-new ghost pepper nuggets so   stay tuned because they're up next welcome to  peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty so here we go with the all-new ghost pepper  nuggets here at bk just in time for the   halloween season and while i'm definitely  digging the crispy appearance of this one   guys they really look pretty nice it's that  light tinge of red that's got me a little   worried here in addition to those pepper  flakes that you can see all throughout   but if you ask me i don't think that's where  most of the heat is going to be coming from it's   actually infused into the outer coating what we've  got here is white meat chicken that's breaded up   with a very special ghost pepper seasoning  and i gotta say guys the appearance looks   really really nice front and back i gotta say  i am digging the way that this looks and again   mildly threatening considering that red tinge that  they're sporting as well and of course with a name   like ghost pepper and for dipping i decided to  get a little ranch action to go with just in case   i need to cool this one down just a bit because  like i said the appearance is kind of threatening   and i want to make sure i've got something  cool on hand aside from a drink obviously   all right so let's not waste any more time on  this one let's see if the heat delivers overall   these are the all-new ghost pepper nuggets  here at bk let's peep out this flavor   well i was definitely looking forward to getting  this one out on october 1st for you guys i mean   what better way to kick off the halloween season  is there than to start off with ghost pepper i   mean ghost in the name alone is already setting  the tone and what i'm seeing here is a very   nice tone set by the outer coating just take a  close look at that this looks ultra crispy it's   got the red tinge some pepper in there as well  but obviously it's the infusion of all that ghost   pepper goodness that this apparently has that has  got me pretty excited right now and believe it or   not i'm kind of worried about this right now so  just to be on the safe side of course i've got   some water ready to go and we're going to get into  some ranch in just a second but guys let's not   waste any more time here we go it's the all-new  ghost pepper nuggets here at bk let's do it well oh whoa very spicy oh wow a little bit of a creeper right there  i wasn't really getting too much heat but   oh man that's actually kicking  up even further with water man these are heated guys they feel  like maybe three or four times maybe five   times the regular spicy one man this is really  kicking right now in the very back of my throat   very strong not peppery even though you're  kind of getting the pepper flakes in there   oh man it's beginning to kind of spread  out in my throat let's go for another bite   guys and we're gonna keep going on but  this is this is pretty awesome already man it starts off as nothing oh and  then it kind of comes up in the very   back and starts spreading around  this is real this is pretty nice man and i'm beginning to sweat too right now let's  grab another one of these wow really nice just   a hyper spicy nugget this is very nice guys and  again the threat is absolutely real with this one   the sizzle is just it's continuing as i'm talking  right now this is going to be a little difficult   but i am really digging the quality guys the  white meat chicken on the inside is nice and juicy   let's just crack one of these open here as you can  see the nice formed nugget goodness on the inside   the white meat action that very  special coating on the outside   and i gotta say i am really digging the quality  of that crispy coating along with the chicken it starts up just like a plain chicken nugget  and because i've had a couple already at this   point now it's really beginning to kick  again man this is really pretty nice it's not like a hyper pepper like black pepper  but the seasoning it's almost got a coolness   but then it's really heated the very back of  my throat right now is literally a scorch fest   this is really pretty nice and again guys nice  coating on the outside the appearance is pretty   nice it's super fun it really fits because of  the holiday season naturally but very very nice   let's go for another bite on these we'll finish  this one out we're going to get into some ranch   sauce because i kind of need something right  now extra i'm beginning to sweat let's do it man it's getting a little worse as we go  right now this is really something else okay   we got some ranch sauce action looks  like some new packaging too this time out   let's go with a little bit of this action i  contemplated some zesty sauce but that actually   has a little bit of a horseradish bite anyway and  considering the type of heat that this is i think   ranch is actually better suited for it but let's  give this a shot we'll keep that focus in there   really really nice i love the sauces  here at bk they're nice and thick oh yeah oh because i actually had already  some residual from the last one last couple   it's kind of cooling it down but wow that  sizzle is still staying even with the ranch   guys i am pretty impressed with the heat  level on these these are pretty nice right now   mmm man super delicious on this really yeah  i'm really digging these i really hope they   keep these on the menu but with these promotional  items probably not just so you guys know in terms   of availability of these ghost pepper nuggets  watch the bk app early in october for something   promotional coming early on like in the first  week and then you'll find these out a little   bit more nationwide as the month goes on but  guys this is something you really want to try   the heat level is definitely up there it's  noticeably elevated and with a name like ghost   pepper you want to make sure that it's elevated  because honestly you really wanted to deliver on   the name as well as the spice i gotta say guys  i'm very impressed with the heat level this is   still kicking right now as i'm going further in  so i feel like my throat is red probably isn't   but i'm tingling all over the place the heat  is definitely hanging with me it's pretty nice man i love the ranch action but i'm adding insult  to injury by having more of these at the same time   because the heat level is building and building  and building but i'm loving these these are really   nice this is really what a spicy nugget should  really be because it really delivers the goodness   not just a little light amount of heat as you get  more and more into it you're going to notice it   is a lot more prevalent and again the chicken  on the inside it's moist definitely juicy and   that's actually saying something from a nugget  coming from a fryer it's pretty good oh yeah   definitely good stuff and especially since  i'm filming this on another hot day here   this is not doing me any favors on top of the heat  thankfully i've got some water i've got some ranch   but guys a very lovely situation so just to  close this one out looks like that one has   a little hole right there in the middle from for  some of the coating falling off but as you can see   a lovely situation i gotta say the appearance is  very nice don't let those black pepper flakes on   there fool you it's the infusion of the ghost  pepper goodness in the actual breading itself   there's nothing dusted after the fact  with this this is all cooked as you see it   so it's already pre-made that way but man the heat  is really delivering the overall thickness is not   bad and again the quality delivers this is just  a super fun item to have and what better time is   there than halloween season for it right pretty nice  man i am super moist right now this was definitely   a lot of fun to check out and even with my fans  going here in the car honestly it's not really   helping me too much i still have a lot of residual  burn in my throat going on the ranch did an okay   job of trying to help me with that naturally the  water kind of kicked it off a little bit further   for me i think in the very beginning but guys  very nice quality it's super fun eight of them   for $1.49 you really can't fade that and the  quality like i said it's a hyper spicy nugget   but i gotta say what it actually delivers in heat  it also delivers in flavor because it actually is   pretty tasty definitely worth checking out so with  that said i'm gonna have to give the all-new ghost   pepper nuggets here at bk a pretty rock solid 9  out of 10 guys like i said all throughout the   review the heat delivers so what you're getting is  really what you'd expect to get with a name like   ghost pepper how much it actually has of ghost  pepper that's probably debatable but at the same   time very heated in terms of what you get there  for me personally i think rounding it out to 10   nuggets for a dollar 49 would have been fun too  but even still you can't fade the fact that for   a little under two bucks you have a pretty tasty  snack i would recommend getting the ranch though   just to be on the safe side delicious all right  so being that it's been a couple of years since   we've actually had something food related here  on the bk menu just in time for the halloween   season i believe it was the nightmare king the  last time out and even a few years before that   was the halloween whopper which i reviewed both of  do me a quick favor drop some comments down below   let me know how excited you are to give these  ghost pepper nuggets a shot being that it's not   like a novelty burger or anything like that how  excited are you to give this one a go and are you   expecting a lot of extreme heat when you give it a  shot drop some comments down below and definitely   let me know and with that this is Ian K closing  out another high quality foodie feature for you   here on peep this out reviews bringing you brand  new content every single week here on my channel   so while you stay tuned for the next review coming  real soon in the meantime stay frosty fyi bk just   a small suggestion from me to you being that  these ghost pepper nuggets are debuting during   the halloween season i think it would have  been better to maybe package them in say   the purple and orange or purple and black type  of packaging i think that would have gone a long   way just for appearance purposes aside from the  hotness on the inside very delicious either way   alright guys until next time i'll talk to you  soon thanks for checking out another one of my   reviews but just in case you didn't see the one  before this one you can find it right up over here   along with what i think youtube's gonna recommend  for you to check out as well as always i think   you'll find something to like in both of them and  i'll definitely catch you in the next one see ya
