 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty what's going on everyone and welcome back to  another high quality foodie feature for you   here on the channel where this time  i'm over at panera bread to go in a   little comfort food classic goodness only  this time made a little bit more portable   that's right you already know what it is feast  your eyes on their all-new grilled mac and cheese   sandwich and already guys i'm digging the toasty  presentation of that thick cut classic white miche   bread it's looking really nice definitely thick  cut and definitely lovely but as they say it's   what's on the inside that counts and in this case  we've got their creamy mac and cheese featuring a   blend of fontina and mozzarella cheeses along with  parmesan crisps and i gotta say guys it's looking   very thick very dense and i'm definitely digging  the shell pasta on this looking really really nice   and it looks like we've got a decent portion of  that mac and cheese to cover both halves of this   sandwich here guys and along with it the aroma  to match i am really digging the pungentness   of that fontina and the parmesan especially this  is looking pretty awesome so let's not waste any   more time on this one it's the all-new grilled  mac and cheese sandwich here at panera bread   let's peep out this flavor yes sir we've got a  very carb-on-carb situation with this one guys   mac and cheese inside of thick cut white miche  bread this is definitely a banging situation   a lot of cheese here as well i am really digging  in the quality and like i said the shell pasta   is really soaking up the cheeses pretty nicely  there as you can see there's a decent amount of   cheesy goodness on this and like i said the aroma  to match notes of parmesan from those crisps and   the fontina cheese guys like i said it's a very  pungent situation and real quick just to set the   tone before i take the first bite when i was a  kid i actually used to make spaghetti sandwiches   believe it or not there was just something about  having noodles on the inside of bread with that   sauce it just tasted really good so i'm expecting  the same type of mouthfeel granted it's a different   type of noodle but with lots of cheesy goodness  and again one more time very very lovely carb-on-carb   action with this here we go it's the all  new grilled mac and cheese sandwich here at   panera bread and man also let me just say this  is very hefty in my hand right now let's do it oh oh rich dense pasty and thick on that guys  there is so much cheese in this i'm actually   tasting more of the cheese than the actual  pasta just adding the more girth to it is   what it's doing right there but man a very solid  amount of goodness right after that first bite   instant flavor overlord this is totally gluttonous  totally comfort food to the next level and i got   to say again guys very very lovely in the flavor  department just a banging situation already   and you know what i think the wild card  with this are those parmesan crisps along   with the mozzarella because the  fontina believe it or not comes   up right after the parmesan flavor but  the thickness and the denseness is just   crazy on this when you combine it all together  let's keep going in this is pretty awesome oh man man now if you can imagine the thickest  grilled cheese you've ever had and i'm not just   talking about the size of the toast i'm talking  about the cheese itself if you can imagine   all kinds of cheesy goodness on the inside with  every bite that's pretty much what this is guys   i gotta say it's really awesome and believe it or  not the noodles are blending very nicely with the   bread to give you that denseness even further but  the quality is crazy on this and like i mentioned   earlier totally glutton is totally flavorful but  the combination like i said works amazingly well   fontina is a very good choice because it's so  pungent and rich and vibrant and when you add   in the mildness of that mozzarella and then you're  coming up with the parmesan crispy goodness here   as well these are fairly thick cut little parmesan  goodies guys it really is pretty nice and they're   crunchy very nice that was really tasty but  of course they're kind of drenched in cheese and   honestly that's a beautiful thing so i'm going  to keep showing you this as much as i can because   like i said this is crazy now this whole sandwich  is about 860 calories so in the 900 calorie range   you'd expect it to be because the cheese is on  overload with this but even still with all the   noodles on the inside of this and of course  that classic white miche bread just a fancy   way of saying artisan white bread really but very  lovely the toastiness is banging on it the quality   is insane i'm going in for another bite guys  because i really want to this is crazy flavorful and we're back with another close-up you know  i gotta say it's been a minute since i've had   the mac and cheese over here at panera but the  creaminess is so off the chart with it and the   flavor is just delivering like crazy it's  not overly salty so you're really getting   a nice rich flavor of that cheese but when you  combine it with everything else on the inside   guys just another crazy situation of tasty  flavorful goodness and again comfort food   overload in the palm of your hand pretty much  portable good to go this is pretty great all right   so let's go for one more bite on this one before  we close this review up with the rating coming   up next but again guys i'm so glad to be giving  this one a shot even though it's well over 100+   degrees right now in southern california i  am loving doing this right now because the   flavor is distracting me beautifully very  very rich vibrant all across the board and   easily worth the price of admission a  little on the expensive side for this   one but it's easily worth it one more  bite and we'll finish it out hang on all right so here's a shot of the other half  just to give you a better representation of the   thickness of that bread guys it really is very  thick cut almost like a texas toast situation i'm   really digging that and of course with all the  goodies on the inside see if we can open this   up for you look at all of that action right there  trying to keep the focus in it's ooey gooey cheesy   goodness delivered from a classic menu favorite  over here panera bread only in more portable form   so with that said i'm gonna have to give the  all-new grilled mac and cheese sandwich here   at panara bread a rock solid 9 out of 10  guys i gotta say this was super delicious across   the board and i think you got that vibe from me  throughout this review but let me just say while   this is not something you'd want to eat every  single day it's making a strong case to change   your mind to do just that because the quality  is so rich so vibrant just ultra creamy at the   same time and like i said the pungent factor  of that fontina cheese along with the parmesan   a banging situation all around just a totally  delicious gluttonous type of sandwich to have   and like i said worth the price of admission  all right so i got to ask you with everything   you've seen and heard up to this point would  you personally spend a little over ten dollars   for a mac and cheese sandwich especially one of  this caliber because like i said guys that was   really pretty delicious across the board all high  quality ingredients but did it look worth it to   you drop some comments down let me know if you'd  actually do that and also did you ever make a   spaghetti sandwich when you were a kid drop those  comments down below and definitely let me know   and with that this is Ian K closing out  another high quality foodie feature for   you here on peep this out reviews bringing  you brand new content every single week here   on my channel so while you stay tuned  for that next review coming real soon   in the meantime stay frosty well i gotta say  as much as i absolutely love grilled cheese   sandwiches this one is completely ruined it for me  right now
