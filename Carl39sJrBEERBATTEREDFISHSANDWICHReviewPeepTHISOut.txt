 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty what's going on everyone it's Ian K back again  with another high quality foodie feature for you   here on the channel cheaters cam style after hours  over at carl's jr because with fish season in full   swing now is the best time to see what they've got  going on the menu just in time for it and truth be   told i've always been pretty curious about their  beer battered fish sandwich and judging by the   looks of this one it doesn't look too bad even if  it's a little on the small side but starting off   with a fairly shiny bun let's pop it and take a  look underneath looks like you can see a little of   the tartar sauce action underneath the top of this  bun but guys take a look at the actual fish itself   what we've got here is a beer battered alaskan  pollock fillet that looks like it's fried up to a   crispy golden brown not too overly large it's not  really super thick but it definitely covers most   of the bun and underneath it looks like we've got  a fairly large piece of fresh looking leaf lettuce   guys and underneath that a little bit more of the  tartar sauce action but coming back to the fish   guys it looks really decent i have to admit  even though it's not super thick it is pretty   wide but again a little on the small size overall  considering the size of this bun and honestly this   really does feel like a value bun to be honest  guys but even still considering what this is   this doesn't look too bad all right so now that we  know what this one has let's peep out the flavor   on this one guys here we go it's the beer battered  fish sandwich here at carl's jr let's do it crunchy hmm the tartar has got a zing to it and  the fish has got that alaskan pollock flavor on   this one guys but i got to be honest with this  already here this really does kind of feel more   like a fish stick that i'm eating right now and  considering the size of it i guess i was kind   of expecting that but they are using alaskan  pollock in this and you can definitely taste   that but it's a little on the thin side as  you're gonna see after this next bite hang on good though well that's a fairly thin fillet but  as you can see it's fairly flaky in the middle   guys and considering the amount of coating on this  one a very lovely situation so you're getting a   pretty decent type of snack sandwich i want to say  that because it doesn't really feel full size when   you bite into this one but even still the quality  is pretty nice the crunchiness of the lettuce   and that zing from the tartar sauce is really  coming through even though it doesn't really   appear to be much on the top in that department  it's definitely in there and the flavor is good   but again this really does kind of smack of  a value type of sandwich that i'm having here   right now and considering that the single  version of this is about four bucks right   here in southern cali you'd be crazy not to do the  two for five that is easily the better way to go   even if you wanted to get rid of the bread off  of the second one and double up on the patty   that may be the recommendation because  then it would be worth it but again   the quality of the bun small guys i mean  small overall there flavor wise i should   say is actually decent there it is fairly  soft fairly fresh and again that size of the   filet itself as you can see it's got some flaky  action going with it guys it's really not too bad i like it but i'm getting that gorton's vibe  from this one guys if you guys are familiar   with any type of frozen fish stick this is  kind of what it feels like but the quality   of the fish on the inside is not bad it's not  overly hot right now either so i don't want to   say this has been sitting for a little bit but  the quality is not bad and considering this is   technically $2.50 if you decide to get the two  for five it's not too bad for that value price   there but four dollars on its own obviously  you know what they're trying to do here   still guys it's great to have an option for lent  this is what they've got currently over at carl's   jr so at least you've got a fish option available  and considering the two for five like i said   that is easily the way to go with this here  let's go for one more bite we'll close this   up after the rating but as you can tell it's  just an alright fish sandwich and i'm glad that   i'm scratching this off the food review bucket  list because like i said i've always been kind   of curious about the beer battered fish over  here carl's one more bite we'll close it out well the pluses with this one are easily going to  be the nice zing that i'm getting from the tartar   sauce although there's not too much on the very  top of it what is here is getting the job done   it's pretty potent guys and definitely it's got  a little bit of sugary flavor to it there it's   not too bad on the bottom of course with that  leaf lettuce a nice combination i'm so glad   it's not shredded and overall what you're seeing  here is a fairly decent value size fish sandwich   is an option over here at carl's but again say  it with me two for five that is the way to go   hashtag two for five and while we're at it  let's go for hashtag unsponsored because guys   the proof is in the pudding with this one and  you easily need another one of these if had   i paid four dollars for one of these right  now i would have felt completely ripped off   two for five is the way to go double up on that  patty get rid of the carb off the second sandwich   and then you're good to go that would be a nice  hearty situation for you and seriously the flavor   on that one is really not too bad so with that  said i'm gonna have to give the beer battered   fish sandwich over here at carl's jr a pretty  okay 7.5 out of 10 i'm not going   to go much higher than that because guys like i  said i was getting that frozen fish stick vibe   from it but the quality was decent for what it is  it's just giving me that familiar feeling of that   like i'm eating a frozen fish sandwich naturally  but even still guys the pollock is pretty good   it's got the flakiness to it and the overall  quality of the tartar sauce like i said it's   got some zing a little bit of sweetness but it  really is potent and i really like that actually   even though it's not really prevalent on the  sandwich what is there does work so not bad   all right so i've got one simple question for  you outside of the usual are you gonna give   this one a shot which you can of course let me  know down below the question is can you honestly   tell the difference between alaskan pollock cod  and say maybe flounder can you actually taste   the difference drop those comments down below and  definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K   closing out another high quality foodie feature  for you here on peep this out reviews cheaters cam   style after
