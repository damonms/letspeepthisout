 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty hey everyone welcome back to another high quality  foodie feature for you here on the channel   cheaters cam style after hours over at mcdonald's  to check out their official entry into the ongoing   chicken sandwich wars and guys let's just say  things are about to get interesting so let's   start it off by deep diving into the very simply  named crispy chicken sandwich and as you can see   we're greeted with a pretty soft looking potato  roll guys it's looking pretty decent already   let's pop it and take a look underneath and while  it definitely appears toasted with a little bit   of butter thrown into the mix take a look at the  chicken patty and the crinkle cut pickles itself   guys i got to admit the patty itself is a little  on the light side along with those two small   crinkle cut pickles and while it does almost cover  the size of the bun itself on the very bottom   here i'm not really digging the size of the  patty being the smallness that it appears to   be but you know what it's all going to be about  the flavor on this one so yeah guys i'm keeping   an open mind with this one but i got to be honest  i'm really excited to peep this out for you right   now but seriously there is a lot more bun in  my hand than chicken if you can actually kind   of feel what i'm feeling right now you'd probably  agree but just looking at it one more time again   as you can see it's a little on the light  side there a little on the small side so   let's just give it a go it's the all-new crispy  chicken sandwich here at mcdonald's let's do it juicy definitely juicy and honestly that's the  real standout with this particular one right now   because i got to be honest guys because you know  i always am with you this really does feel like   i have literally a couple of nuggets together  here this is a small chicken patty right now   but even still the quality of what i'm biting into  is pretty decent it's noticeably juicy like i said   the flavor it's not too overly salty the coating  is a little on the light side but at the same time   the meat is pretty solid on the inside  let's go for another bite i'll give   you that close-up but so far it's just  okay i gotta be honest it's just okay you know on the real this is kind of reminding  me of that southern style chicken sandwich from   a while back so this really kind of feels like a  retooled version of that but the juiciness is on   point as you can see the flakiness of the chicken  is pretty nice as well i'm definitely digging the   softness of the potato roll and those pickles are  decent as well but honestly i really need at least   one or two more pickles on this one to round  it out because even though the chicken is small   the pickles are not really covering on the inside  and you'll see it further on some of the close-ups   but so far guys like i said it's just okay you  know given that these chicken patties are not   hand breaded in the store they're simply just  dropped into the fryer from what i was told i   kind of assumed that maybe some of these may be  a little on the smaller side compared to others   i'll have to see as i go further down the line  but like i said what i got here right now is   juicy it's tender but just a little light in the  overall size and considering this is close to five   bucks you'd expect it to be just a little bit  more sizeable but then again this is just what   i got right now but i am liking the flavor don't  get me wrong it's just a little on the light side   you're going to hear it all throughout the  review because i really feel like this one   is on the smaller side of the spectrum with the  chicken that i got right now let's keep going in you know i got to be honest i'm pretty  thankful this is pretty juicy right now   considering i waited about seven minutes for this  so this was definitely made fresh guys but again   a little on the small side i can't get that out  of my head right now because it really is tiny   and when you take a look at the bun in the very  back here look at how much bread i got right there   and look at what i got inside of it there  so i don't know about the quality control   of this particular one but at the same  time i'm digging the chicken itself like   i said it's super fresh and the coating is  very nice I'd venture to guess this is like   maybe 80% meat and 20%  coating so the ratio is solid   and the potato roll is nice and soft and again my  only gripe with these types of rolls and i usually   come back to this whenever i have a potato roll  that doesn't have any dusting on the top of it   it's just that it doesn't really feel like  an authentic potato roll because you're not   feeling that floury dustness on the top or  the bottom usually on the top mostly but the   quality is nice it's nice and soft and it  dovetails nicely with everything else here   it's just like i said you're gonna hear it again  i got a small chicken patty here right now for   almost five bucks come on mickey d's i know this  is a new thing but at the same time i really hope   some of the other versions of this that i try are  going to be a little bit more sizable but we're   going to find out but again a nice quality tasting  chicken sandwich and i can't really complain too   much about that because it does have the juiciness  factored down pat let's go for one more bite we'll   finish this one up after the rating and then  we'll move on but not bad guys just not bad well since you've already seen the back of this  one after a few of those last close-ups let me   just pop the top on this one here and show you  what i have left after the bites that you've seen   me take that is it guys that is it so decent for  what this is like i said the flavor is okay on it   but some of these nugs so to speak here i  think better be a little bit bigger on the   other versions that i try this is just okay well  you know i gotta rate them as i get them and   unfortunately in this case i'm gonna have to give  the all-new crispy chicken sandwich here at mickey   d's just an average 6.5 out of 10  like i said this could have been so much better   had it been a little bit more sizable in my hands  considering the price point i mean the bun looks   like it's ready to hold a bigger piece of chicken  i think that particular one kind of came up short   literally but guys the flavor is pretty decent  the coating like i said it's just lightly salted   it's definitely juicy white meat and i'm digging  that overall i'm not really tasting the butter too   much but everything does feel pretty wet when you  bite into it that's a very lovely situation there   i only wish there was maybe one or two more extra  pickles on it but even still guys i'm definitely   digging what i had here tonight flavor-wise  it's just the obvious price point and the size   that really kind of killed this one all right so  now the obvious question because i have a feeling   since you've made it this far into the review you  already know you're going to be giving this one a   shot so after you do what did you personally think  of this one i mean i'm very curious to hear your   experience with it drop some comments down below  and definitely let me know and with that this is   Ian K closing out another high quality foodie  feature for you here on peep this out reviews   cheaters cam style after hours bringing you brand  new content every single week here on my channel   so while you stay tuned for that next
