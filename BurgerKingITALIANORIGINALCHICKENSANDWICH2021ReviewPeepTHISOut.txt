getting a nice little upgrade   that's right you already know it's the  italian original chicken sandwich so   stay tuned because it's up next welcome to  peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty so here we go with the italian original chicken  sandwich here at bk and already guys we're being   greeted by that classic sesame seeded long bun  very cool looking on this one and i gotta say guys   with that cheese and sauce action in the middle  i have a feeling this is gonna be pretty tasty it   smells pretty awesome already all right so let's  pop the top of this long bun and take a look   underneath and what we're gonna find is plenty of  marinara sauce and guys let's pan down and take a   look further plenty of mozzarella cheese on top of  it guys and speaking of on top that's all on top   of their long chicken patty here guys a classic  without a doubt and it's definitely given me all   the feels from back in the day basically it's a  formed patty of white meat chicken and i gotta say   guys a big chicken nugget no doubt but very very  nice and of course it fills out this bun perfectly   and just by the looks of it it looks like we've  got plenty of marinara sauce on the bottom as well   but guys very simple build on this one basically  just sauce the cheese and a chicken patty and i   gotta say i am definitely digging it all right so  let's see about confirming the flavor on this one   this is the all new italian original chicken  sandwich here at bk let's peep out this flavor   man i'm not even gonna front on this one this  does look pretty tasty guys i mean fried up to a   crispy golden brown on that chicken patty right  there and plenty of sauce and the mozzarella   cheese and of course that classic bun a lovely  situation all around how bad could this really be   it's already smelling like a very tasty  situation all right enough with the   initial chit chat here we go it's the italian  original chicken sandwich here at bk let's do it come on come on all right first off it's that  classic original chicken sandwich flavor from   back in the day and since this debuted  back in 1979 literally 40 plus years ago   believe me i feel pretty old right now  doing this but i gotta say the flavor is   pretty timeless it's exactly the same thing  but in this case we've got a nice little hit   of marinara sauce and mozzarella cheese and i  have to say that is just a lovely combination   a very simple build on this one but man it just  works extremely well as you can see on the inside   the formed chicken patty that classic bk  goodness right there and of course the   softness of that sesame seeded bun on the very  top as well tasty guys tasty let's keep going in the light tartness and the tang of that marinara  sauce goes amazingly well with the fried outer   coating of the chicken patty and of course  the creaminess of that mozzarella cheese   is another lovely situation guys i'm not  really tasting the mozzarella too much but   you can definitely get the mouthfeel  from it it really is nice and creamy   and overall it goes extremely well with  this as you'd expect it to i mean guys   this is like a little mini chicken parm  sandwich but stretched out pretty tasty   and like i said that flavor is timeless i mean  i reviewed this a few months back and i got to   admit guys it really took me back to 1979 i mean  literally i was like six years old when that came   out i think ALIEN was in the theaters at the time  but guys again the flavor is exactly the same but   with the addition of marinara sauce and mozzarella  cheese it's a lovely little italian upgrade to   what we've got going over here let's keep going  in for a couple more bites guys pretty tasty yeah this is easily a favorite already and  considering it's part of their new two for   seven menu which you're probably seeing up on  your screen here right now you've got a lot of   nice choices to go in on for two for seven and  i have to admit on its own i mean $3.50 for this   maybe a little bit of a stretch but when you get  to two for seven that's the bonus but even still   very lovely situation overall with  the amount of chicken in this and guys   it fills out the bun very nicely i mean almost  perfectly i mean look at that a decent amount   of the cheese action on there let me see if we  can try and lift up this bun i'm going to kind   of destroy it slightly but as you can see it's  kind of soaked in right over there very nicely   and again just a very lovely situation and yes  i know i keep saying that right now but guys   it is a lovely situation it's melted cheese and  marinara sauce with a fried piece of chicken on   top of a bun how bad could this really be right i  mean it's pretty tasty all right so let's go for   one more bite before we close this one up with  the rating coming up next but guys again a very   decent value with the two for seven and again very  familiar flavor with a kicked up upgrade of cheese   and tomato sauce the marinara is pretty nice  on this and that tang and tartness like i said   is on point it goes pretty nice one more  bite we'll close this one out hang on   well let's just go around the world with this one  and obviously guys a very nice little upgrade to   what we've already got over here i'm definitely  a fan of the chicken nuggets over here at bk so   this really does feel like an elongated chicken  nugget there's really nothing wrong with that   because you know what you're getting when you  get it but guys again the very timeless flavor   from back in the day kicked up very nicely with a  decent amount of cheese and it fills it out very   nicely in the bun along with that marinara sauce  definite recommendation guys very tasty indeed   so with that said i'm going to have to give the  italian original chicken sandwich here at bk   a pretty rock solid 9 out of 10 guys  like i mentioned it does feel like a big   chicken nugget that you're biting into  but if you're a fan of them like i am   you know exactly what you're getting with this one  again the timeless flavor of that 1979 original   i gotta say it's pretty banging on top of the fact  that you get some decent melted cheese with that   although it's a little on the light side in  terms of the flavor the overall marinara makes   up for that and the overall creaminess of the  whole experience is pretty awesome and again   two for seven is not bad on that guys pretty  nice quality and again it is pretty tasty but   i think you know that by now right all right  so for any of you old timers out there do you   guys actually remember when this first came  out back in 1979 and for those of you who   are brand new to it how excited are you to try it  actually with tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese   drop those comments down below and definitely  let me know and with that this is Ian K closing   out another high quality foodie feature for you  here on peep this out reviews bringing you brand new
