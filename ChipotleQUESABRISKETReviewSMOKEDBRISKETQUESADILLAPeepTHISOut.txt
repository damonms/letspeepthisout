 hey everyone welcome back to another high  quality foodie feature for you here on the   channel where this time i'm over at chipotle to  see if their quesadilla is actually worth the   price of admission and not only that i'm actually  going to be checking it out with their all-new   smoked brisket that's right it's the quesabrisket  so stay tuned because it's up next   welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty so here it is the quesabrisket available  either online or through the mobile app only   and i have to say guys presentation wise this  is actually not looking too bad i'm definitely   digging the way the sauces look all lined up  there it's a very nice presentation so far   all right so starting off with the star of the  show what we've got here is the quesabrisket   split down the middle and folded over and as you  can see what it consists of is a crispy oversized   tortilla and on the inside plenty of melted  cheese and their new smoked brisket and the smoked   brisket is looking pretty plentiful i gotta say  i'm digging the presentation it looks very nice   especially when it's split like this and off to  the side we've got three included dipping sauces   although i did actually upgrade one of them for a  premium charge but starting off on the very bottom   here we've got the tomatillo green chili salsa  as well as the tomatillo red chili salsa and that   upgraded charge obviously goes for the queso  blanco i definitely wanted to go in on that cheesy   action and i can't wait to mix this one up just  a bit so again while i'm definitely digging the   presentation this definitely looks like there's  going to be some nice flavor across the board   here i'm really hoping this is going to be worth  the asking price of admission but even still that   smoked brisket is looking pretty awesome so there  you go it's the quesabrisket available online   or through the mobile app only here at chipotle  let's peep out this flavor yes sir it really looks   like they packed this one up pretty nicely guys  there is lots of smoked brisket on the inside   and plenty of cheese and of course the crispy  goodness of that tortilla itself is pretty nice   i don't know about close to fourteen dollars nice  but even still this definitely looks and it smells   pretty awesome you can definitely notice the  smoked brisket pretty nicely and hopefully that   bodes well for some awesome flavor because if it  smells this good i'm expecting it to taste pretty   incredible here we go it's the all new  quesabrisket over here at chipotle let's do it yes sir there's a lot of rich smoky flavor in  this smoked brisket and considering smoked is   actually in the title you'd expect there  to be a lot of that in here right and it's   absolutely shining through it's noticeably  upgraded compared to the regular steak and   i gotta say guys with that cheese action going  with it a very lovely situation as you can see   it feels fairly filled out with plenty of meat on  the inside i don't really seem to have too much   cheese but the flavor is really really nice with  the exception of the cheese in the front there   but even still this is absolutely packed let's go  for another quick bite we're gonna go into some   sauces here but so far i'm pretty impressed am i  $14.00 impressed the jury's still out on that hang on all right truth be told this is my very first  time having a quesadilla over here at chipotle   and i'm absolutely digging the crunchiness of  that tortilla on the very top guys and actually   with all the meat goodness here it dovetails  very nicely and with the cheese that i have i   don't have nearly as much cheese as i thought i  would but even still the quality of that smoked   brisket is pretty banging and for those of you  keeping score at home this is actually my very   first chipotle review here on the channel so that  actually says something too guys i'm really glad   that i waited to do something truly special and  naturally with something like this i think it   warranted a look considering the price point of  that quesadilla was kind of scaring me originally   i mean eight or nine dollars for quesadilla on its  own but with their all-new smoked brisket being   added on top of it for a few dollars more i was  still curious enough to give this a shot because   i figured let's just kill two birds with one stone  we'll do the quesadilla which is available online   only and we'll also knock out some smoked brisket  to see how good that is because considering how   tasty this is i can see myself getting it on  my regular bowls over here it's pretty good   all right now here comes the challenge trying  to do this dip and keep it in focus let's go   for a little bit of the green sauce first i'm  just going to kind of light it up as much as   i can i'm probably not going to get too much  on here this is probably not going to be too   eventful for you until we get to the cheese  let's just try it with the green here we go that's actually really good yeah i'm definitely a  fan of the green chili salsa over here at chipotle   i added to pretty much everything that i get  bowl wise i'm burrito wise too but even still   nice quality it's just like i remember in terms  of the flavor it tastes very fresh it's cool on   top of it so naturally it's helping to cool down  the quesadilla but nice flavor overall but when it   comes to the red guys let's give that a shot and  again i'm gonna try and keep that focus for you   let's just go for this one in here as well  we've got a nice bite right over here plenty   of it this actually hugs the tortilla a  little bit better than the green here we go hmm heat nice got some sizzle  wow that's definitely got a   little extra heat there hang on it  is a little steamy in here right now very very nice on that nice heat definitely nice  heat okay now let me just swing this around the   other way to get it closer to you because we are  going in for some queso blanco action the added   upgraded charge let's try and get this in here as  well and obviously this is going to hug it very   nicely some extra cheesy action because honestly  i don't have too much cheese on the inside of this   quesadilla so far so this is going to help right  now let's give it a shot with the queso blanco mmm there it is oh yeah that is really  good light saltiness the creaminess of   the cheese itself the queso is banging that's  actually really good smokiness of the meat   very nice situation again there's some prime cuts  on the inside of this one guys this is actually   pretty nice they do pack it pretty well i just  wish there was just a little bit more cheese to   go with they have a lot of tortilla and a lot  of meat but the cheese action is a little light   so this queso is definitely helping let's  go for one more quick little bite on that yeah okay so the word on the street  is that you have to mix the queso   with the red chili salsa so what i'm going to  do is keep that somewhat in focus for you i'm   going to kind of mix this up just a little bit  so you guys can see i know that's kind of blurry   in front there because it's focusing on my face  but there we go a little bit of the action we're   going to go for a dip on this and i'm going to  not cheat and actually i almost wanted to put   the fork in my mouth here right now let's go for a  dunk and keep this one focused as much as possible   there we go got enough in there a little bit  of heat a little bit of queso let's do it yeah absolutely the queso blanco is kind of  killing some of the heat from that red chili   salsa so i don't really even need some water  with this one but it's giving a nice little   back burn that i'm getting from pretty much the  last bite actually with that chili but even still   the quality is pretty nice the queso is  awesome the saltiness is pretty awesome as well   but as you guys can see i'm at the end of this  half already with plenty of tortilla left over   but not a lot of cheese so honestly i think the  reason they recommend going with the queso is just   in case believe it or not you don't get enough  cheese in this you've got the queso to go with   and that kind of makes up for it creaminess  is awesome and it's pretty tasty all right   so since i'm at the very end of this with some  toasted tortilla this is almost begging me if not   it wants me to actually go right into that queso  action again so we're gonna do that just to round   this one out here and of course i'm gonna show  you another close-up of the other half because   there's nothing too much to see here except  some of their queso action hang on one second well as you guys can see on the very top right  over here this was actually flipped over upside   down on the tray and there's a lot more oil on  this one here coming from that smoked brisket but   even still lots of tasty goodness on the inside  of this guys there's really a decent amount of the   smoked brisket and considering the price point  i appreciate that i just wish there was just a   little bit more cheese and overall i just wish it  was just a little bit bigger believe it or not for   that price point but even still very flavorful  and what they've got going over here and it's a   noticeable upgrade over the existing meat choices  that they've got in addition to the standard meats   that you've got here along with the sofritas and  the fajita veggies you've got some really nice   options here with the smoked brisket very nice so  with that said i'm going to have to give the new   quesabrisket here at chipotle just in okay  7 out of 10 guys this is not blowing my socks   off by any means i mean the quality of the smoked  brisket is really good but again it's missing some   of the queso that i want to have in the quesadilla  itself it wasn't super cheesy like i thought it   was going to be and considering it little over  10 for the price point there i got to say again   it is definitely a premium price point on top of  the queso blanco which you're adding on top of   that which is an extra $2.50 you're getting close to  the $14.00 range already guys so it's very expensive   and like i said your mileage may vary in terms of  how it's prepared i don't want to have to worry   about getting enough cheese if i decide to give  this one a shot and the more that i think about   this i'm probably just going to stick with my  regular bowl or the regular burritos because   naturally for the price point it's going to be  a little bit less overall i'm going to get a   lot more food packed into what i'm used to getting  this was fun to definitely check out for sure but   like i said it's a premium price point that really  kind of kills the score slightly but again this   time out i wish i had a little bit more cheese  especially for my first inaugural review for   chipotle here on the channel but hey it is what  it is all right so i'd venture to guess if you've   made it this far into the review you at least have  some interest in the smoked brisket itself if not   the quesadillas so do me a quick favor drop some  comments down below what are you more excited to   try the actual smoked brisket on the menu here  at chipotle or the regular cheese quesadilla on   its own and if you've tried both together like i  have right now what did you personally think of   it drop some comments down below and definitely  let me know and with that this is Ian K closing   out another high quality foodie feature for you  here on peep this out reviews bringing you brand   new content every single week here on my channel  so while you stay tuned for that next review coming real soon   in the meantime stay frosty yeah this was pretty  fun to check out for the first review here on the   channel from chipotle guys and i got to say the  quality of the sauce is very very nice and the   quantity of the sauces is very nice as well i  just wish the extra $2.50 for that queso blanco   wasn't there naturally and more of that queso was  in the actual quesadilla but hey it is what it is   alright guys until next time i'll talk to you  soon hey thanks for checking out another one of   my reviews but just in case you didn't see the one  before this one you can find it right up over here   along what i think youtube's gonna recommend  for you to check out as well as always i think   you'll find something to like in both of them and  i'll definitely catch you in the next one see ya
