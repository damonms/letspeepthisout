 what's going on everyone and welcome or  welcome back to the channel it's Ian K   where today i'm over at wing stop because  as summer begins to heat up it looks like we   have a hot new flavor to go in on as well that's  right and it's in the form of their all-new hot   honey rub and i'm going to be adding it to some  thigh bites so stay tuned because it's up next   welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty ah yes some fried crispy goodness from wingstop  these definitely look pretty awesome guys feast   your eyes on it it's the hot honey rub thigh  bites and i have to say i am totally digging the   presentation with this one nice and crispy and it  looks like they're coated up pretty nicely as well   all right so very simply what you're looking  at here is a regular order of their thigh bites   featuring juicy dark meat that's breaded up and  fried to a crispy golden brown and in this case it   features their hot honey rub which is actually a  dry rub blend of honey along with some heat thanks   to cayenne pepper and ancho chili and i gotta  say that's all you really need guys two main   ingredients i think that's gonna deliver the heat  nicely off to the side of course we've got some   ranch to help cool things down in the event of  but guys i gotta say the presentation is looking   awesome on this one nice and crispy and definitely  very inviting so i'm not wasting any more time on   this one these are the thigh bites featuring the  new hot honey rub here at wingstop let's peep out   this flavor yes sir i definitely love looking at  this one and i have a feeling you might as well   guys the presentation is really killer plenty  of that hot honey rub all over these pieces of   chicken here right now so being that it is a dry  rub i don't necessarily need to use a fork i mean   they're kind of warm still so let me just lift  one of these up here very nice in terms of the   seasoning on this guys just take a look at that  really really nice a decent amount of meat let's   see that coating also nice and crispy again see  how that's going to be with everything overall   here we go it's the all new hot honey  rub here at wing stop let's peep this out crispiness sweetness and a  little bit of heat not too bad   that's good yeah that's got a little bit of  sizzling action guys but it's very tolerable   for me take a look at the inside of this one  here this actually looks like it's a little   bit of white meat actually but the coating to  meat ratio is a lovely situation very nice on   this one and as i'm talking it's beginning to pick  up pace just a little bit here let's keep going in i love the light sweetness on  that crunchiness crispiness   fried goodness and then a little  bit of the heat is coming up not bad i'm digging that yeah that's beginning to  elevate just a bit as i'm getting further   in here let's go for another one take a look  at this pretty non-descript looking i mean if   you've seen one type of fried nugg so to speak  or thigh bite you've pretty much seen them all   but the coating is nice a very decent  amount of the seasoning let's keep going in that light sweetness really nice and the  heat coming up slightly in the back end   nice flavor guys really nice flavor okay  let's do a little bit of ranch here the   house made ranch is always a bomb situation  see if i can cool this down just a bit the tartness of the ranch the sweet tang  that it's got the sweetness of the honey   the fried goodness a little bit of the heat  still that's a beautiful combination let's go   for another one we'll do a couple more here this  is really really good wow look at this one guys   that is a nice chunk of goodness and the dry  rub action is beautiful on this really really   nice all right a little bit more ranch action wow  the heat is beginning to pick up just a bit here wow wow this is such a banging combination  and guys again take a look at that meat on   the inside i guess it is thigh meat it's not  super super white like regular chicken breast but   it's kind of tasting like that to me but the  juiciness is on point and the seasoning on   this very very nice a very lovely situation on  this guys i love the fried crispy outer coating   we're gonna do another couple like this here real  quick wow really really good let's keep going in wow this is such a treat right now   yeah definitely some delicious goodness with  this one guys and considering i'm filming this   on launch day i think you're probably going to  be seeing this one right around the 4th of july   holidays so if you guys are watching this right  before the 4th a very happy 4th of july to you   as always so i guess it's a good thing it's around  that time because this is really setting off the   fireworks in my mouth right now because the heat's  beginning to pick up so let's go for one more bite   on this one here and then we'll wrap the review up  with the rating coming up next but guys a lovely   situation of wingstop goodness with a hot honey  goodness to go with and i gotta say that light   sweetness is pretty amazing on this guys really  nice along with that light heat pretty good so here's some more good looks for you guys a very  nice flavor over here at wing stop that really   begins to get a little bit more heated as you get  further in as expected but initially you're going   to get some light sweetness and a nice crispy  outer coating as you'd expect from wing stop   along with that heat coming up on the back end  thanks to the cayenne pepper and the ancho chili   a nice combination and it's a good thing  that i got ranch to go with this because   it really dovetails beautifully with that this is  definitely something worth checking out absolutely   so with that said i'm gonna have to give this  new hot honey rub flavor here at wing stop on   some of their thigh bites especially a rock  solid 9 out of 10 guys just a beautiful   combination of sweet and a little bit of heat  coming up on the back end and the more you eat   it the more it begins to pick up but aside from  all that you get a nice decent quantity when   you get a regular order of these it really looks  pretty awesome and fills out the container nicely   and again the flavor is absolutely primo in  this on top of the classic thigh bites over   here at wingstop a very nice combination of sweet  and heat definitely something worth checking out   all right so do me a quick favor drop some  comments down below let me know if you've actually   given this one a shout already
