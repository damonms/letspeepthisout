 the amazing colonel presents abraca-chicken  introducing beyond fried chicken only kfc all   right so after what was clearly a very successful  test market about a year or so ago kfc is finally   taking their beyond fried chicken nationwide and  being that i actually checked it out about a year   or so ago when they were doing that i decided  to swing them back to see if this is actually   going to be better the second time around so sit  tight guys because coming up next is part two of   kfc's all new beyond fried chicken welcome to  peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty all right so welcome or welcome back to the  channel it's Ian K going in on something very familiar   guys i mean this is looking pretty much exactly  like i remember and as you're gonna see here lots   of crispy goodness for sure i'm definitely  digging the presentation on the six piece   and i can't wait to get into this but first  things first let's break this one down what   we've got here is a six piece order of beyond meat  that's formed into chicken guys this is actually   made from plants using pea protein and lots of  fried crispy goodness on the outside of it clearly   but as you're going to see here they look like  chicken nuggets but they're made from plants   and i'm definitely digging the presentation  a little too formed for me personally   but still looking very very good and of course  you can have chicken nuggets without something   to dip into and in this case we're gonna have the  rebranded finger licking sauce known as kfc sauce   to go in on as well as some of their classic ranch  i definitely can't wait to do that so yeah looking   very familiar indeed and like i said for the six  piece that i'm looking at here i think the pieces   look a little too formed for me to be honest but let  me just pick one of these up here and we'll get   into it and as you're going to see they're almost  like little perfect squares actually with a little   bit of ridge there they got a little bit of ridges  on the side there on either side actually as we go   around but the crispiness is absolutely on point  so let me just rip one of these really quick and   this is not working very well there we go all  right it's a little tough wow that's actually   very tough but as you're gonna see it looks like  it's got the chicken fibers as you can see very   nicely done there in terms of the presentation  but that actually had a lot of pull so let's   give this a shot guys it's the all-new beyond kfc  beyond fried chicken actually let's give it a go wow very tough but familiar flavor all right  right off the break aside from the toughness   one thing i'm noticing right away is this doesn't  taste initially like kfc's famous chicken i mean   the 11 herbs and spices are supposed to be on  this naturally that's what you're expecting   but overall i'm not really getting any  of that it almost feels a little generic   in terms of the flavor let me see if  that can kind of focus in and you can see   again it looks like chicken but it's kind  of falling apart on the outside with the   coating this time around i don't know let me put  that one down real quick here this is actually   a little bit of a better representation as  you can see it looks like a piece of white   meat and the coating looks decent you can kind  of see all the little seasonings on the inside   of this one here but at the same time so far  it's a little so-so let's just keep going in man that is tougher than i remember it's not bad  it means fried but no not really feeling it so far   i mean again i like it because it's fried i  mean the flavor is okay but it's a little bit   more of the generic version of a chicken nugget  to be honest and actually with the pea protein   formed into chicken on the inside here  that name brand beyond meat goodness   it's cool to have the representation of chicken  visually but so far the flavor is not quite   doing it for me this time and considering the  price point on this one so far seems a little   lackluster to be honest but hey it's good to have  choice right i mean naturally having variation on   the menu is a good thing and having the option  for beyond meat is always a beautiful thing so   let me whip open a little bit of the kfc sauce  here and we'll go for a dip to see if this is   gonna do anything flavor-wise obviously with  the sauce i think it's gonna do something   but at the same time let's just give it a shot  all right so at first glance it looks like a   straight up chicken nugget going into some kfc  sauce aka the finger looking good sauce here   but let's give this a go with it and see how  the flavor is yeah definitely looks the part okay this piece is a little bit softer   maybe a little bit more tougher on the other  one this one is actually a better experience   hmm not bad with the sauce and again just  to show you on the inside because visually   this looks really really nice it looks very  solid and again like a white piece of chicken   but it's based off of pea protein and plant-based  fibers so as you can see it's looking really   really good and of course it goes amazingly well  with the kfc sauce here so let's go for another   one with this and then we'll get into some ranch  next but this is definitely helping obviously better piece this time definitely better piece   and again just to show you that plant-based  action from beyond meat a very cool looking   chicken nugget even though it feels a little  generic it's definitely fitting the part in   terms of the visual representation not bad  there all right so we're going to get into   my old standby the classic ranch i can't wait to  do this with these beyond nuggets but again a very   interesting experience this time around guys  so far let me pick up another one here and see   if we get the same experience and hopefully it's  going to be better or the same as the last one as   you can see nice and rich nice and thick on this  here let's give it a shot with the classic ranch hmm okay i think that first one was the outlier  they've been better since definitely but and it's   a big but don't get it twisted i'm not getting  the 11 herbs and spices from the colonel it really   feels like a generic chicken nugget that's the  only thing so i think that's pretty much what this   is but the branding is kfc because the flavor is a  little on the blander side but at the same time i   mean it's fried it's crispy and it definitely  presents well like i said in terms of the   presentation on the inside i'm just really kind  of surprised but even though i can kind of see all   those little seasonings that are on the outside  of this right now you're not really getting that   in terms of the flavor and again just to show you  as you can see it looks like we've got the peppery   goodness it looks like it's got something extra  to it it's just not really delivering that's the   only thing so i was hoping this was going to be a  little bit more improved naturally from the last   time around when it was in the initial test market  phase so this is kind of the addendum to that   hoping that it was going to be a little bit better  compared to the first time around which it wasn't   bad the last time either but this feels like it's  the exact same thing that's the only problem with   it so i wish it's a little bit more pronounced  in terms of the flavor but at the same time   you have an option for fast food when it comes  to beyond meat now it's over kfc nationwide and   that's actually a good thing so there you go the  outer representation of a chicken nugget is not   looking too bad on this one and as you can see it  looks like it's seasoned up fairly well and on the   inside as you're going to see a very cool looking  doppelganger for white meat chicken but at the same   time the flavor is just a little muted my overall  opinion and naturally i'm not really getting   the 11 herbs and spices from kfc if you were to  blindfold me and have me bite into this i wouldn't   think it's a kfc product but at the same time it's  cool to have a choice and again visually it looks   really really slick plant-based fried chicken kfc  it's finger licking magic all right so given the   fact that i'm experiencing the exact same product  the second time around i'm not going to be giving   this one another rating because naturally if  you've seen my first review all the further detail   that you're going to get from that one is going  to be the exact same thing i was really hoping the   quality was going to be just a little bit better  overall in terms of the spicing the 11 herbs and   spices in general but like i said what we've got  here is the same generic tasting nugget but with   the kfc name on it so i'm expecting a little bit  more from it naturally from a nationwide release   and i think you guys are as well but hey do me  a quick favor drop some comments down below let   me know if you've given these a shot and if you  did what did you actually think of the overall   flavor were you getting the kfc vibe so to speak  with this one drop those comments down below and   definitely let me know and with that this is  Ian K closing out another high quality foodie   feature for you here on peep this out reviews  bringing you brand new content every single   week here on my channel so while you stay tuned for  that next review coming real soon in the meantime   stay frosty well i gotta say i'm definitely  digging the packaging kfc i mean this really does   fit the part and visually it looks amazing across  the board naturally the presentation of the chicken   itself the inside of it and of course what you're  seeing on the outside especially when you buy it   but at the same time that's not where it counts  it's when you bite into it that it has to taste   amazing and while it's okay it is what it is at  least from my experience today all right everyone   until next time i'll talk to you soon hey thanks  for checking out another one of my reviews but   just in case you didn't see the one before  this one you can find it right up over here   along with what i think youtube's gonna recommend  for you to check out as well as always i think   you'll find something to like in both of them and  i'll definitely catch you in the next one see ya
