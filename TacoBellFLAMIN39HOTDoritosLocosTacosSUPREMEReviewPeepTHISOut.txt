Bell at Doritos locos taco nacho but with flaming hot dusting to go with so digging that red tinge right there looking really really nice on the inside because this is the supreme variant you've got some diced tomatoes some shredded cheddar cheese we've got some shredded lettuce there some sour cream on the very bottom the familiar meat here at Taco Bell looking really really nice guys I got to admit this really looks really solid so let's get into it and see how the flavor is gonna be on this one I think I know what to expect it's the flaming hot Doritos Locos Tacos here at Taco Bell let's peep out this flavor yeah I'm really diggin the marketing on this and is very very slick its direct and to-the-point you know exactly what this is take a look at that one more time a very cool little

drops every week guys the flamin hot Doritos Locos Tacos supreme here at taco bell let's do it this looks really really good hmm right away the heat on my lips the cool creaminess of the sour cream that is a bangin combination ooh yeah that is definitely flamin hot you can tell lots of tomatoes falling off this as well believe it or not all of that flavor is drowning those out so I'm actually okay with that but wow that is really tasty in the shell it's that familiar in nacho flavored Doritos Locos Tacos a little bit of heat but guys a very lovely situation and as you'd expect from the supreme a nice situation in terms of the sour cream and believe it or not those tomatoes like I said are not really bothering me too much but the familiar meat from Taco Bell very much on display with this one and again the loveliness of that shell that is just a lovely situation nice and crunchy it's got a lot of nice flavor this is easily something that I think should stay on the menu obviously it really is a nice accent and it really is a replacement I think to the fiery Doritos Locos taco my very first Taco Bell review you guys want to see some serious cringe take a look at that video popping up on your screen right now I watched that back recently and I was like oh my god what was I thinking with three-quarters of that content but hey you got to start out with something right this is pretty awesome let's keep going with it we'll give you some more close-ups it's pretty good guys it really is but you'd expect it to be right mmm mmhmm yeah that last bite was a pretty lovely situation and just so you guys know these sleeves are really good for marketing but there's a reason for them and you can see why I'm holding them right now to keep all that dusting from getting on your fingers I have a very decent amount and I got to admit I am really glad these actually hold it very nicely guys look at this I'm holding it all the way in the back and that is just a lovely situation right there but guys great stuff all around the flavor is amazing and I got to admit I'm really surprised they waited this long to bring back that fiery Doritos locos taco with the official branding but being that those Doritos Locos Tacos are the most popular things on the menu here I'm glad this is back I'm easily gonna be getting this throughout this promo solid stuff all right let's start off this wrap up with what I think the heat level is on this particular one personally for me I'm gonna say it's a little bit more like a high 5 I mean it definitely lets you know that it's there that residual burn is nicer on the lips naturally but it's definitely elevated when it comes to fast food hot so I'm really diggin that but on the real as I'm eating this it's totally reminding me of the fiery Doritos Locos taco and honestly that's really what it is just with the official branding so I really like the fact that flamin hot is definitely on this one and I'm glad this one is actually back on the menu let's hope it stays so with that said I'm gonna have to give the flamin hot doritos Locos Tacos here at Taco Bell a pretty rock-solid 9 out of 10 it's that familiar flavor that you're expecting from flamin hot on the famous nacho Doritos locos taco to begin with so guys you have a lot to look forward to with this one with or without sauce it's got some nice residual burn pretty solid now the obvious question at least to me anyway is did this look pretty solid to you do me a quick favor drop some comments down below first things first are you a fan of flamin hot I
