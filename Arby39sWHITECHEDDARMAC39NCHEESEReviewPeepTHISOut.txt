 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty hey everyone I'm back at it this time over at Arby's to check out a true comfort food classic perfect for a rainy day that I'm experiencing right now guys take a look at the white cheddar mac and cheese and I got to say this looks extremely heavenly already as you guys can see it's the classic elbow macaroni smothered in plenty of white cheddar cheese sauce and guys it is super creamy looking super rich smelling and I got to say the overall texture of everything on this is feeling very dense and very hearty this is looking really really good oh yeah we are most definitely gonna be giving this one a shot with the aroma in my car being as heavy as it is right now in white cheddar I got to admit I am super excited to get into this but like always but what we do if you guys are fans of high-quality delicious looking food reviews make sure to hit that subscribe button down below and don't forget to tap the Bell icon so you could be notified as soon as brand-new content drops every week guys without further adieu it's the white cheddar mac and cheese and it is very thick to get onto this fork right now let's give this a shot here at Arby's oh it is so pasty sticking all around the mouth but the flavor is poppin ridiculous right now Wow mmm the elbow noodles themselves slightly al dente so they've got some chew to them but that is a lovely situation and then the light saltiness that I'm getting from the white cheddar but it's very dense and very rich very thick this is pretty amazing right now guys pretty amazing indeed mmm man and perfect for a rainy day right now as well man this is very heavenly very heavenly this one has got no problem sticking to the fork guys they are very heavy-handed with the cheese sauce on this one and absolutely that is the way to have this this is really really nice what really sets it off again like I mentioned earlier is the al dente elbow noodles that is just a really lovely situation and it makes it even heartier along with that rich flavor this is really outrageous right now and hey on a rainy day who doesn't love warm mac and cheese right I mean it's really perfect for the weather right now not only is it keeping me warm in the car but like I said the aroma is so insane with white cheddar cheese sauce I have to admit guys so delicious already on this one here why am I talking let me keep going in on this this is really great mmm man so thick as it's getting a little older it's getting thicker and thicker a little bit harder to chew on it believe it or not but that's a good situation because it's a testament to the cheese that they're using in this and the fact that they're using a lot of it is pretty insane guys this thing is literally packed with white cheddar cheese and it's definitely got some denseness to the actual container I'm really loving this right now I'm super excited to be having this too I can't even talk anymore I'm going for one more bite we're gonna finish this one out with the rating I think you know what the ratings gonna be but let's just go in on a guy's super delicious stuff all right let's go for another extreme close-up and like I mentioned before there is no problem with this one sticking to the fork right now guys it's such a heavy-handed portion of white cheddar cheese sauce that as it gets older it's actually getting a lot better and a lot more full-featured in terms of the flavor guys initially you're gonna get it nicely but then as you begin to get into it it gets richer and creamier and denser and heartier as we go just a delicious version of white cheddar mac and cheese over here at Arby's really great stuff so with all that said and when it comes to the white cheddar version of mac and cheese here at Arby's I'm gonna have to give it a rock-solid 10 out of 10 really nothing wrong with that whatsoever guys but if they really wanted to take it up even further a little bit of bread crumbs would be amazing on it along with maybe a little melted cheese on the very top of it just to kind of dovetail into what's already a very delicious side item this one definitely needs to stay on the menu over here it is super delicious super rich and definitely something I'm gonna be getting again great stuff but the question is rainy day or not are you gonna be
