I'm most definitely gonna  be putting that bold claim to the test by   going in on their all-new loaded truff nacho  fries so stay tuned because they're up next   welcome to peep this out reviews  with Ian K stay frosty all right so I guess the question is are you  truff enough to give these new fries a shot   am I truff enough well I'm here doing this review  so that counts for something right guys Feast your   eyes on it here we go with the loaded truff  nacho fries and right off the bat guys there's   a lot of pungent black truffle goodness here  in the car these are looking pretty awesome   let's break these on down real quick okay so  starting us off is a nice portion of the ever   popular nacho fries back on the menu here at Taco  Bell featuring those bold Mexican spices and in   this case with this version It's topped off with  steak reduced fat sour cream a three cheese blend   tomatoes nacho cheese sauce and the main star of  the show outside of the fries the truff sauce   which actually features a unique blend of black  truffles that you can smell and red chili peppers   along with some extra creaminess and I gotta say  guys very pungent is not even the word for it this   is extremely pungent and it looks pretty awesome  as well it's smelling pretty great so let's not   waste any more time on this one let's see if the  flavor is going to match the awesome Aroma here in   my car these are the all new loaded truff nacho  fries here at Taco Bell let's peep out this flavor   yes sir some definitely awesome Aroma to go  with the Saucy action with this one guys again   it presents very very nicely and on the real I'm  not expecting this to be too much different from   the regular Chipotle type of Nacho fries that  they've done in the past because naturally it's   going to have a little bit of heat I'm sure  but all the other familiar flavors are in   effect for you so it looks pretty great like I  said the presentation is awesome let's go with   a little bit of everything here initially and  it looks like I got just about everything in   one bite right there all right take a look guys  right there on the fork we've got a few of the   fries of course that hot sauce in effect  there on the top as well let's give this   a shot it's the all-new loaded truff nacho  fries here at Taco Bell let's peep this out mmm black truffle right away mmm a little bit  of a Sizzle nothing crazy that's really good   the creamy Factor along with the  cheese as well wow pretty nice   and you know what while I'm definitely digging the  tolerable amount of heat with this one here let me   just wash the palette just a little bit with some  water because it's a little elevated just a little all right guys very nice on this again I'm gonna  keep showing you this as much as possible that   truff sauce really stands out pretty beautifully  and I think the collabo is warranted because   this fits in pretty nicely with Taco Bell's  goodness and I have to say again the quality   is definitely off the chart very nice on this  one let's go for a few more bites pretty tasty   mmm you know I wish I had a little bit more  steak on this one here but it looks good   I mean the accent of all the toppings and  it's very hearty so let's go for another   couple on this one I'm definitely digging  this here we go some of the fries are a   little on the Soggy side just a little but  there's so much sauce and everything on this   but again the aroma and the overall flavor of that  black truffle action is pretty awesome that name   brand goodness is really standing out on this a  pretty nice pairing I think hmm wow it's not a   chipotle sauce but it's got some heat and some  nice smokiness to it as well I'm digging that   and again that pungentness that I'm getting from  the black truffle is so strong on this guys I mean   look at that it's a pretty decent amount of the  sauce that they put on this and that it looks like   a pretty amazing bite right there look at all that  action very very nice so I think you get the point   with this one here it's another variation of the  popular nacho Fries over here at Taco Bell this   time with a cool collabo with truff hot sauce  and honestly I take back what I said earlier   about expecting a Chipotle like Flavor with this  because even though it's got a little bit of the   heat the name brand goodness of that truff sauce  is pretty banging so let me knock off this last   bite before we wrap the review up with the rating  coming up next but guys a very fun outing with   the fan favorite nacho fries here at Taco Bell  it's exactly what you'd expect with the spices   and naturally the flavor but with some really  awesome toppings the usual goodies from Taco   Bell with that name brand hot sauce action from  truff one more biting we'll finish it out hang on creamy cheesy with some nice combo action coming  from that reduced fat sour cream and the truff   sauce guys that is a really beautiful situation  and again the unique blend of the goodness of   this one has got with the black truffles and the  Chili Peppers it's got the Heat and the overall   Aroma matches that flavor of the Truffle  action pretty nice on this one give it a go yeah you really can't hate on this one guys  I mean it's got all the familiar flavors from   Taco Bell with the cheesy action on top of their  bold Mexican spices that are on those nacho fries   a fan favorite for the last few years now it's  come back so many times but with the addition   of that truff sauce a banging situation so  with everything you've seen and heard up to   this point in this review I'm gonna have to  give the new loaded truff nacho fries a rock   solid 9 out of 10 guys familiar flavor is notwithstanding that truff sauce is the wild card   and thankfully it really stands out amongst all  the toppings on this one the only minor hit is   the fact that the steak is a little light for  me on this portion but again you're getting a   fairly nice portion of what you've got here  guys this is actually a very very nice size   in the biodegradable container I think you get  more food like this and I'm totally digging that   so yeah definitely give this one a shot if you're  a fan of the nacho Fries over here at Taco Bell   and I'd venture to guess if you've made it this  far into the review you absolutely are right   all right so do me a quick favor confirm that for  me down below in the comment section let me know   if you've given this version of the nacho fries  a shot over here at Taco Bell and do you think   this is the best version because of the truff  sauce on it drop those comments down below and   definitely let me know and with that this is Ian  K closing out another high
