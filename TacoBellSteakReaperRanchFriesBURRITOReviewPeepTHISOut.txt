 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty I'm back at Taco Bell to check out the other half of their latest promo and this one definitely looks like it's wrapped up good to go yesir it sure does so let's go in on the steak reaper ranch fries burrito and as always we've got that average sized tortilla that Taco Bell loves to use it's definitely warm definitely soft and on the inside of it all the goodies from the steak reaper ranch fries are in effect for you of course you've got the steak you can see in the very top and on the very bottom of it and nacho fries the usual bold Mexican spices all the good stuff we talked about from the previous review we've got some reduced fat sour cream some tomatoes some nacho cheese sauce and we have the reaper ranch sauce that's in there as well a combination of ranch and Carolina Reaper pepper and I gotta say guys this is not too packed I mean it looks okay for the size but there's really not too much else going on with it here but it looks okay definitely smells pretty decent and absolutely wrapped up good to go let's see how the flavor is gonna be on this one guys it's the steak Reaper Ranch fries burrito here at Taco Bell let's peep out this flavor so are you a fan of high quality delicious looking food reviews well if so definitely hit that subscribe button down below and don't forget to tap that Bell icon so you could be notified as soon as new content drops every week let's dive into this one alright guys it's a pretty heated 90 plus degrees outside of my car right now and on the inside even though I've got my windows slightly cracked around me it is just as crispy if not more so and I'm about to get into something that's supposed to be pretty heated to begin with talk about a glutton for punishment right let's not waste any more time it's the steak Reaper Ranch fries burrito a little small guys that you have to say but let's give it a shot familiar flavor and it should be familiar because I just did the steak reaper ranch fries supreme here at Taco Bell yesterday which that review should be popping up on your screen right over here right now but guys I have to admit I'm getting a little bit more heat this time around because maybe it's a little bit more concentrated in the burrito compared to what I got on the fries I'm not gonna spoil too much about what happened in that one you can definitely click the link right over here and check that out but this so far is a better experience even though it does seem like it's a little bit smaller overall just with everything on the inside let's keep going with it well this one's definitely more portable and easier to eat than the regular steak reaper ranch fries supreme and while I do like that fact I like the idea of everything all together in the tortilla it's packed pretty well I don't think I'm getting as much for my money with this one I think I'm actually getting less compared to what I got yesterday which wasn't a lot to begin with guys but what you're seeing here is all the same ingredients wrapped up pretty decent I do have to admit it is a nice package but I just wish it was a little bit more packed if you get my drift yeah it's definitely a little less packed they absolutely have room in this tortilla to add more filling guys I really think it would have been a little bit heartier had they done that and considering the prices here in Southern California $3.49 is what this burrito goes for here but I actually got around that this time by ordering it through the app and I was able to get it for $2.99 so if you happen to be in an area where the prices seem to be up a little bit try and check out the app first there 9 times out of 10 you may get it for what it should be advertised at and I'm thankful I was able to do that today because considering how small this is right now I don't feel as ripped off but I still kind of feel ripped off because there's really like nothing in it but let's just keep going with it we'll just like on my steak reaper ranch fries supreme review and even though I'm getting a little bit more of their Reaper ranch sauce in the burrito I'm not really getting anything crazy above and beyond in terms of the heat level it's just mildly elevated to me it's nothing really crazy I mean like I said in the previous review as well I've had habanero in the past I've had some other things that have really done it to me pretty nicely but this is just okay I mean the spicing is nothing crazy at all you'd think with the Reaper name it's gonna be crazy right I mean but it's not that's the crazy thing about that but sour cream is in this naturally the ranch that it's mixed with those together I think are muting it just a little bit but overall it's just a portable version of those fries and naturally I just wish there was just more of a filling that's really the main thing guys for $2.99 at least it should be a little bit more substantial that's just me so if you don't want to mess with the fork this is obviously the version you're gonna want to go with but what I would recommend doing is asking for a little of that reaper ranch on the side just so you can dip into this just in case what they give you is not enough because clearly what's on the inside of this overall isn't enough even for the $2.99 price point I really need a little bit more on this guy's I really do so it's a little bit of a better experience compared to the fries by themselves at least in my opinion anyway and that also means that you get a better score right obviously I think it should so with that said I'm gonna have to give the steak reaper ranch fries burrito a pretty decent 7 out of 10 just marginally an improvement over the previous version guys even though I had a little bit more of the reaper ranch sauce in it the overall quantity of everything else in that burrito was a little on the light side and even at the $2.99 price point it needed to be beefed up just a little bit I mean literally on all accounts but the sauce was pretty tasty even though the heat really wasn't there for me but still very portable to eat and tasty nonetheless but of course the obvious question is that this look pretty delicious to you drop some comments down below how excited are you to give the reaper ranch fries a shot in either burrito form or the standard fry version and if you've had either one which do you prefer drop those comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K closing out another episode of peep this out bringing you brand-new content every single week here on my channel so while you stay tuned for that next review coming real soon in the meantime stay frosty yesir I gotta say while I'm definitely glad I got this one through the app at the National advertised price of $2.99 I still feel it's a dollar more expensive than it needs to be even at $2.99 two bucks Taco Bell two bucks for something like this alright everyone until next time I'll talk to you soon but before you go and just in case you haven't already take a look at the last review that I put out right up over here along with what I think YouTube is gonna recommend for you to check out as well as always I think you'll find something to like in both of them and I'll definitely catch in the next one see ya
