 what's going on everyone and welcome back to  another high quality foodie feature for you here   on the channel where this time i'm over at chili's  to check out their entry into the never-ending   chicken sandwich wars and truthfully it looks  like they've got a pretty strong looking contender   so without further ado here we go with the  simply named chili's chicken sandwich as   part of their three for ten menu and as  you can see guys for ten dollars i've   got a pretty decent amount of food  here this is looking pretty awesome   so starting off with my drink of choice i decided  to go in with a little unsweetened tea and for my   appetizer selection in this case as you can see  we've got a little caesar salad action but guys   the main star of the show and what we're going  to be focusing on is what you're seeing here   the main entree itself their all-new chicken  sandwich coming with a small side of fries   this is actually looking pretty good guys and i  have to say that toasted brioche bun is looking   pretty awesome it's definitely got some height  to it let's pop it and take a look underneath   and right off the bat you're going to notice we've  got a little bit of the brand signature secret   sauce and this has actually got a nice color to  it here and that's actually more prevalent on top   of the actual ham breaded chicken breast itself  guys this is fried chicken galore here and it's   looking pretty nice a definitely sizable piece of  chicken without a doubt ham breaded and fried to a   crispy golden brown as you can see underneath it  looks like we've got a large tomato slice along   with plenty of shredded lettuce and of course more  of that secret sauce but guys coming back to that   chicken i gotta say i really dig the presentation  of what i'm looking at here because it really   outshines the bun considerably it's a large piece  of chicken for sure so let's see if the flavor is   gonna deliver on this one as we focus on the star  of the show this is the all new chili's chicken   sandwich naturally from chili's let's peep out  this flavor well it looks like we're at the start   of a major heat wave that's about to blow through  southern california this week but i gotta say when   it comes to chicken sandwiches chili is bringing  the heat all on its own right now guys at least   in the presentation department i am so digging  what i'm looking at here right now the crispy   golden goodness this chicken is offering is very  very inviting and even with that tomato slice on   here i think most of you guys know i'm not a fan  of tomato i'm still thinking this is going to be   pretty tasty so let me see if i can confirm the  tastiness for you as we go even further into the   never-ending chicken sandwich wars this time from  chili's with their chicken sandwich let's do it crunchy wow now you'd hope that coming from  a fast casual sit down restaurant naturally   you're going to have a very solid quality chicken  sandwich and guys so far after that first bite   it is very high quality the chicken is  very juicy the hand breaded fried goodness   you can easily taste that right away and  actually the sauce i'm really not getting   into so much because of the fried flavor being  so strong but at the same time i'm digging it   so far let's go for another bite we'll give  you a close-up but so far very tasty hang on oh yeah well as tasty as i thought that first  bite was after that second one the main star of   the show is easily going to be that secret sauce  guys it's got more of a honey mustard flair to   it with a little thousand island mixed into it and  it's really taking the flavor up big time and it's   really showcasing the fact that it's stronger than  the actual flavor of the patty itself with the   fried outer coating but even still guys very nice  in the brioche style bun and the chicken is very   plentiful if not wide not so much thick but it's  definitely covering this bun and over exceeding it   actually pretty tasty yeah the fried goodness is  just that fried goodness and guys honestly like i   said with the size of the patty being so wide  i'm so digging the quality of what i'm eating   here right now but again the main star of the  show is going to be that secret sauce and really   it feels like more of a honey mustard vibe maybe  a little bit of barbecue sauce maybe a little bit   more thousand it's got some sweetness to it but  the quality is pretty nice let's keep going in yeah definitely pretty tasty in this one  and this tomato is actually making things   just a little bit slippery for me here right  now so let me put this one down really quick   because i want to go into the fries really  quick for you and as you can see they've got   a little bit more of a wendy's vibe as it  begins to focus in more of the natural cut   got a little bit of the skin action  on here let's try this real fast restaurant style you can totally tell light  saltiness nice mushy type potato on the inside but   crispiness on the outside pretty good all right  because i want to get rid of this tomato here real   fast fortunately the flavor is not really doing  anything for me in that tomato department because   the strong sauce that secret sauce is really  beginning to do its job even more as i get into   this but as you can see let me bring this up for  you here as the focus is in guys a lovely piece   of chicken on this here it is just very nicely  done all solid white meat as you can tell and   it really does feel like it was ham breaded in  store the way they advertise it but the size   of the bun i am totally digging here right now  let's go for a couple more bites guys really good yeah that chicken is nice   you know i'm really digging the secret sauce  on this one here right now i kind kinda wish   i got some on the side for the fries but maybe  next time around because i'm definitely gonna be   getting this one again very nice and as you guys  can see again i'm gonna keep showing this to you   guys the quality of the chicken is really what's  standing out with this and it really is a pretty   decent value at three for ten really digging  the overall size of everything here as well   and considering the value like i said that  three for 10 promo i've got my drink i've got   the appetizer which is a salad you can go for  a few other things but they count the fries as   part of the entree with the chicken sandwich so  technically it's like four for ten i guess when   you look at it that way but guys really good all  right so let's go for one more bite on this one   then we'll wrap this review up after the rating  coming up but guys a very solid value like i said   for the money and especially with everything  that you're getting here guys pretty nice and   thankfully the quality of the chicken sandwich is  pretty banging one more bite and we'll close it up well starting off in the very back as you can  see more of that fried crispy goodness guys   this one really kind of needs a chicken sandwich  diaper if you ask me because they have a lot of   stuff here that's falling out the back strictly  because of that tomato adding so much moisture to   everything again but even still a very nice  situation with the chicken quality itself   a very quality brioche style bun and honestly  that secret sauce is the wild card with this one   it goes pretty nicely with this and i can  only imagine how it would be with some fries   pretty solid over here chili's for this one so  with that said i'm gonna have to give the all-new   chili's chicken sandwich a well-deserved 9 out  of 10 guys even with that promo being what it is   three for ten is a pretty solid value or four for  ten i should say considering fries is considered   part of the entree you've got a lot to look  forward to with this one in particular not only   is the presentation pretty solid but the quality  of the chicken really shines pair that up with   that secret sauce that is a banging combination  now unfortunately this is only going to be good   for the month of june apparently but considering  how great the sandwich is hopefully they'll keep   it around maybe just a little bit longer it really  is a solid addition to the menu over here and like   i said as part of that three for ten a.k.a four for  ten you can't go wrong with that pretty good okay   so i've got one basic question for you out of all  the chicken sandwiches that you've seen me review   here on the channel for all the reviews that  you've seen here on the channel
