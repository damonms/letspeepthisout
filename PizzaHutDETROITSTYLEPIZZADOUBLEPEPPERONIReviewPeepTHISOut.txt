 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty hey everyone welcome back to another high quality  foodie feature for you here on the channel where   this time i'm back on over a pizza hut for an  early first look at a brand new product that's   about to go national and if the thumbnail to  this review is any indication i think this   thing is going to be pretty awesome so let's  just get into it because i know you want to   see it it's the all-new detroit style pizza  here at pizza hut and already i am digging   the caramelized edges of what we've got going on  here guys that cheese around the crust is looking   really awesome so what we've got here is a  square pizza cut into eight pieces and on   the very top what you're noticing is vine ripened  tomato sauce the cheese is underneath it   and i gotta say it is definitely awesome looking  basically that's designed to keep the crust light   and airy so it's reversed and i'm already digging  that 50% more cheese all across the board on this   one and those crispy cheesy edges are definitely  on point really digging the overall presentation   and as you can see we've got some awesome looking  pepperoni on this one there's double pepperoni on   this and it looks absolutely delicious but on the  reel it's that vine ripened tomato sauce that i'm   really interested to check out and again the crust  itself is looking really really nice again those   caramelized edges look really really fantastic  nice and toasty and of course i'm already digging   the bucket shaped pepperoni slices on this  one guys all those nice oils on the inside   and again the presentation is really really cool  on this it really feels pretty hefty on top of it   you can really feel there's a lot of dough there's  a lot of cheese with this and again presentation   is killer all right so let's dive into this  one here i'm going to pick up a slice because   the box recommends going for the corner pieces  for all the cheesy goodness there and obviously   you really want to start off with that and i can  see why take a look at that nice and caramelized   around the edges over here you can see they line  the pan with that cheesy goodness no difference   in the recipe it's the standard pizza crust here  so the pan goodness already feels buttery in my   hands but again that vine ripened tomato sauce  and that pepperoni is looking utterly fantastic   let's give this a shot it's the all-new  detroit style pizza at pizza hut let's do it   oh saucy man filming pizza in the car is always  a challenge so let me just say i am super glad   the box is square right now it's very easy  to sit on the lap but guys the tanginess and   tartness of those vine-ripened tomatoes on this  one instantly comes out big time it really pops   with flavor it's gonna get you right in the very  back of your throat it's really really strong   and then you're getting all the nice doughy  cheesy goodness um that this has to offer but wow   that sauce is a showpiece with this one big  time along with those pepperonis and again   a little oily on the peps but because  they are kind of curled up i am digging it   but the doughiness is banging on this one and the  butteriness also you can see that right there this   is flat out delicious guys and a really awesome  effort from pizza hut to emulate something that   i think you're going to recognize from the  other guys we're not going to name them you   may see them on the screen but you know what  it is guys very very tasty let's keep going in crispy pepperoni double action on this you know  with me not being a super fan of pepperoni this   is very very delicious right now i got to say guys  the quality of the pepperoni has a little bit of   spiciness to it a little bit of heat and i'm  really digging that so nice quality all around   and it complements the amount of cheese on this  it is very very cheesy and the dough has got some   nice thickness as well but hey if you're looking  for choice you do have four other options with   this one you can go for the standard cheese  you can go for supremo you can go for meaty   as well as create your own in addition to the  pepperoni guys so five ways to get this one   for $11.99 that's not a bad deal at all so flat  pricing across the board but you get your choice   of toppings with those five options and i got to  say guys a delicious situation again the cheese is   really nice on this you can really taste there  is extra on here but that vine ripened tomato   sauce is a major banging highlight with this this  really makes it as far as i'm concerned and again   the presentation looks killer they pretty much  drizzle it across each side of the pizza so each   piece is going to get a nice little strip down  the middle and i'm digging that so depending upon   your toppings you've got a lot of nice tomato  sauce goodness to go with let's keep going in yup you know i'm so glad this is finally  out right now especially after seeing   the chewboom article about a year ago  when they were testing this back east   i believe it was youtuber jesus in a  tortilla had a chance to go in on this   and i'm really glad that this is out nationally  so i'll put a link down below to that article   definitely jump on over to jesus in the tortilla  tell him Ian K sent ya but i gotta say guys this   is absolutely delicious and worthy of the  wait i gotta say to have something like   this on the pizza hut menu this is really  really good let's go for a couple more bites the caramelized edges are so killer on  this and the butteriness is banging too   well for the last couple of thoughts on this  one before we close this one out after the   rating coming up guys the presentation like  i said really differentiates this compared to   the other guys aside from the quality of what  i have here it really feels like an authentic   detroit style pizza if not chicago like i said  because they usually put the sauce in the very top   the cheese is underneath it the way that it's  done so you're getting the essence of that with it   but with the cheesy caramelized edges that are  just done very very well and again that's really   where the similarities end because everything  else really feels like it's different so it may   look very similar but the flavor is absolutely  different especially with that vine ripened   tomato sauce guys that's really the key with  this on top of the overall quality of those   pepperonis at least with this variation of it  so one more bite we'll close this one out after   the rating but guys an easy recommendation i  know you're gonna run to give this one a shot   you should be running to give this a shot  it's easily worth your time one more bite   all right so let's go around the world with this  one here and as you can see again a lovely amount   of dough on this one guys it's absolutely raised  just enough where you're getting a nice hearty   bite with every single one that you take and  again those caramelized edges are absolutely   delicious nice and toasted and overall those  corner pieces are going to be the most sought   after ones in this piece here very very delicious  situation and depending upon your toppings again   that vine ripened tomato sauce they need to  put that on their regular pizza because this is   really good and those pepperonis i gotta love  those bucket style goodness that really soaks up   all the oils nice and crunchy nice and crispy with  just the right amount of heat absolutely delicious   stuff so with that said i'm gonna have to give  the all new detroit style pizza here at pizza   hut a rock solid 10 out of 10 and that's coming  from someone who's not super into pepperoni but   guys i really enjoyed that i mean the quality of  those pepperonis was primo as you can see they   were curled up very nice around the edges almost  like a light caramelization of its own to go   with the crust and that crunch was just awesome  just the right amount of spice too but for me   it's all about the vine ripened tomato sauce  easily on that one aside from the caramelized   edges of that dough and the overall presentation  was just delicious 50% more cheese and definitely   a banging situation all around run do not walk  to give this one a shot you're gonna dig it   okay now the obvious question because i already  know you're gonna give this one a go which version   out of those five choices that you heard in this  review are you personally looking forward to   drop those comments down below and definitely  let me know and with that this is Ian K   closing out another high quality foodie feature  for you here on peep this out reviews bringing   you brand new
