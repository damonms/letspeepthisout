you the close-up of the   marketing they've got going with this here as you  can see in the style of the colonel himself and the   outside of the packaging is jack harlow you gotta  love that guys jack harlow and kfc together for   this one i'm really digging the overall look of  this here it looks really cool on the outside of   the cup as well as the chicken sandwich beautiful  stuff okay enough of that let's get to the food   all right so here we go with the jack  harlow meal here at kfc and i gotta say   a very nice combination of goodness guys it looks  like they've curated a lot of favorites on this   menu for this one here and i gotta say it looks  really really great starting off with that main   chicken sandwich guys let's take a look at that  spicy chicken goodness starting off with that   toasted brioche bun you already know what it is  underneath it looks like we have a little bit   of that spicy zinger sauce but as we pan down  guys take a look at that hand breaded goodness   a double breaded extra crispy chicken fillet and  i gotta say it is huge that is definitely looking   pretty awesome fills out this bun pretty nicely  a lot of solid white meat for sure and underneath   it it looks like we've got about three or  so crinkle cut pickles along with more of   that spicy zinger sauce but guys the size of the  sandwich is looking pretty awesome on this one   very nice moving right along we have a fairly  decent portion of their mac and cheese looking   nice and creamy i gotta say i'm excited to get  into that and of course guys the secret recipe   fries you gotta love it guys the 11 herbs and  spices supposedly coated all over these potatoes   and they are looking pretty nice and crispy off to  the side we've got a classic ranch dipping sauce   to go with and to help wash it on down we've got  some lemonade a very nice tall cup of lemonade to   go with very very refreshing guys this just looks  like a lot of comfort food and a lot of fun to get   into i can't wait to do this right now and i'm not  gonna have to wait too much longer because it's   about to go down guys this is the jack harlow  meal here at kfc let's peep out this flavor   yes sir how's this for an opening shop before we  get into this guys a very lovely situation when   it comes to the chicken sandwich over here at  kfc and i would expect nothing less considering   how awesome it really is if you're looking for  some more detailed thoughts on the spicy variant   of this chicken sandwich you're probably seeing  that review jumping up on your screen here right   now do check that one out i'm just going to go  for a couple of bites of each of these naturally   just to kind of get into it naturally because i  really want to taste everything and then we'll   finish off with the final rating in terms of  the overall value of everything here so guys   let's get into it for a couple of bites in  this one this is looking really tasty and again   look at the size of that chicken filet  with that spicy zinger sauce action we   got some pickles buried under there as well  let's get into this guys let's peep this out mmm so good you can really taste the double  breaded goodness with this guys it is coated   very nicely and look at that solid block  of white meat action right over there   the nice zing that i'm getting from that  zinger sauce pun intended with the spicy action   the crunch snap and acidity from the pickle as  well a very very lovely situation you know what   let's go for a couple more bites on this one  before we move around here this is really tasty all right you guys get the awesome money shot  of this one and i'm getting a lot more of that   spicy zinger sauce personally that was a very  nice second bite and a nice combo of all the   flavors of this one a very hearty sandwich  no doubt guys very delicious stuff i gotta   say i am loving this already i mean how could  i not it's kfc it's fun to eat all right guys   let's take a look at the mac and cheese i don't  think i've ever reviewed the mac and cheese here   on my channel and this is a very nice portion  over there pretty much the same as with all the   combos if you get like the mashed potatoes or  anything else let's give this a go it kind of   smacks of like a kraft mac and cheese vibe here  it's a similar type of noodle but take a look   at that fairly creamy as you can see let's give  this a go the mac and cheese over here at kfc definitely kraft mac and cheese  vibe it's tasty though maybe a   little bit more saltiness and the creaminess is  definitely pretty nice that's a nice combo guys   comfort food i mean mac and cheese and fried  chicken a lovely situation and you know what   let me wash this down with a little  bit of some lemonade action here oh yeah that's just a fun combo already  guys very very nice all right more mac   and cheese goodness let's go for  another couple of bites on this it's actually not bad i mean i love mac  and cheese who doesn't but i have to   say a little bit more of the kraft mac and  cheese vibe which is fine i mean i dig that   and i have to say again the creaminess is  not bad fairly on point guys fairly on point that is really good okay let  me sneak one more bite of this man that's a nice combo i'm  digging this so far super fun all right and of course the  secret recipe fries again   11 herbs and spices all over these fries  here and they're looking pretty nice nice   and crispy let's lift up one of these here  it's a little broken but let's give this a go a light saltiness not bad i swear this is some  type of chicken broth or chicken type of powder   sprinkling it's giving me the vibe of like  chicken broth and you'd expect it because   it's kfc right i mean secret recipe fries  again i've reviewed these in detail as well   too you're probably seeing that review jumping  up on your screen as well check that one out   these are not bad not too bad in terms of the  crispiness as well they hold the composure nicely   but again with the 11 herbs and spices as the  main selling point with these on top of supposedly   the secret recipe right that's really kind of the  big thing with this but we have to see how that's   going to go with the ranch and for those of you  guys who are fans of the channel you already know   i love ranch absolutely love it okay let me grab  uh we'll just grab a couple let's just give this   a shot here so we'll try and keep the focus it's  a little contrasty but take a look creamy creamy   that's really kind of blown out but as you can see  it is very rich very thick let's give this a go oh yeah tasty and you know what   because i keep coming back to it let's go for a  quick dip of this here on the chicken sandwich   very lovely can you tell i like the chicken  sandwich over here kfc it's pretty awesome all right so as i'm sampling all the goodness  here essentially having lunch with you on camera   real quick because this is actually a very fun  promo to check out a lot of fun items and a lot   of the things that i would personally choose  myself very lovely let's go for one more quick   shot of that mac and cheese i'm really digging  this just on its own this is just really tasty really very good and to be real whoever is  going to be attached to the name for this   combo it really is a nice combo just on its own  just individually if you were to order these a   very lovely situation pretty good we should  just make this my meal yeah i gotta have it   all right so let me go for one more quick swig  of this before we wrap it up with the rating   uh lemonade is good there's a lot  of sugar in that but it's very good   okay guys overall value-wise i'm gonna have  to give the jack harlow meal here at kfc   a pretty awesome 9 out of 10 guys you're  getting a lot of really great items with this   one in particular they're all favorites over here  at kfc naturally but when you factor in the price   point of the sandwich itself being about four or  five bucks along with a premium side being the   mac and cheese along with the fries the ranch that  you're getting on the side and of course the drink   it's not a bad value when you individually get  those because i think it would be over the $10   mark so name or not jack harlow thanks so  much for putting your name on this because $10   for all this food is not bad maybe throwing a  cookie in for good measure would have been kind   of fun for dessert but guys it's not a bad value  the flavor is good and i gotta say out of all   the promo celebrity meals that have come out this  past year most notably from mickey d's primarily   with the saweetie meal as well as the bts meal i  have to say this version from kfc works for me   strictly because the value i think is high in the  quality of the ingredients of what you're getting   here seems a little bit more as well so i don't  really mind paying the $10 price point for this   because like i said that chicken sandwich is  massive and it's already four or five bucks to   begin with so you're getting all the other  goodies for an additional five bucks over   it's not bad and guys the flavor vintage kfc guys  really really tasty stuff all right so i've got   one very simple and easy question for you out of  everything that you've seen in this jack harlow   meal here at kfc do you personally think it's  worth $9.99 drop those comments down below and   definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K  closing out another high quality foodie feature   for you here on peep this out reviews bringing  you brand new content every single week here on   my channel so while you stay tuned for that next review  coming real soon in the meantime stay frosty yes   sir good choices
