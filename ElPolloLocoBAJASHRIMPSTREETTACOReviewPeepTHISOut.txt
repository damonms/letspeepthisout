 you already know what it is it's Ian K back at it this time over at el pollo loco because it looks like they've got shrimp back on the menu so stay tuned because the Baja shrimp taco is up next welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty so here we go with the Baja shrimp taco here at El Pollo Loco and right off the bat I'm getting nice hints of garlic in the air you can definitely smell the marinated goodness on this one it is pretty nice let's take a look on the inside of this tortilla looks like we've got about four of those nicely sized shrimps lined up beautifully they're marinated in garlic and Chipotle we've got some freshly shredded cabbage some light Pico and a baja chipotle sauce to go with as well so a nice little combination of goodness there and like I said that garlic is really standing out I decided to get a little avocado salsa on the side this is actually one of my favorites here beautiful situation we'll go for that it's got a little bit of heat to it extra so hopefully that'll mix with what's already looking like a pretty tasty taco to begin with well there you go it's the baja shrimp taco here at El Pollo Loco let's peep out this flavor yeah this definitely smells pretty awesome you can absolutely tell that these shrimps have been marinated in that Chipotle and garlic goodness guys so very excited to jump into this but real quick and like always before I do just that if you guys are fans of high quality delicious looking food reviews make sure to hit that subscribe button down below and don't forget to tap the Bell icon so you can be notified as soon as a brand new content drops every week guys the Baja shrimp taco my very first time trying the shrimp over here at el pollo loco let's do it mmm a little bit of a squirt there actually mmm that's good that Baja sauce has got a little bit of a mayonnaise type of vibe to it so it's not my all-time favorite but the sizzleness is definitely there which is really nice not crazy hot just to kind of let me know that it is there but the shrimp are absolutely succulent guys nice and juicy on this one and just to give you a little bit of a look on the inside of this one here as you can see the shrimp are fairly decent-sized I wish that was just a little bit more cabbage a little bit more fullness to the overall taco though as you can see it looks like it's a little empty on the top but overall the nice marinated that you can see the seasoning on that shrimp is a nice situation it's a nice sized shrimp there to take a close look at that it really is pretty decent but guys I got to be honest I wish it was just a little bit bigger overall for $2.99 that's really the only thing all right now considering this is literally like a four biter of a taco considering this four shrimp in here let me jump right on into that salsa real quick and go for a little avocado goodness here guys I'm absolutely a fan of the avocado richness that's in this it's got a nice little bit of heat on its own but I'm excited to see if this is gonna do anything to the overall flavor which is pretty decent already let's see hmm totally takes it up absolutely mmm that is really good I'd almost want to get this again but with some avocado slices and you can actually do that when you customize it if you decide to give this one a go it's $1.49 at least here in my area which means this taco would literally be $4.49 for this guys so the size like I said with two bites left that's pretty much it I don't think it's worth it for that but it's still very very tasty but hey if shrimp isn't necessarily your thing you've definitely got some other options on this mix-and-match menu over here at El Pollo Loco including the obvious chicken taco you've also got a keto friendly taco and even a pollloless taco as well but for this one I really wanted to give the shrimp a try considering I've never really had it and as you guys can see again just to kind of wrap this one up here it's decent for what it is I just wish it was just a little bit more filled out there's a decent amount of cabbage and that baha sauce is actually good the spicy Baja goodness and this one it really sets this one off I just wish like I said there was just a little bit more to go around for the money but guys decent either way El Pollo Loco feed the flame man this rainy weather is completely playing with the focus on my camera right now I hope you guys got all that all right so with that said after this quickie look at his Baja shrimp taco here at el pollo loco I'm gonna have to give it a pretty decent 7 out of 10 like I said the only thing really killing this one is the quantity on the inside for the money because the flavor is absolutely there and the decent-sized shrimp is a nice plus there as well I was really hoping they weren't gonna be very very small but then again for $2.99 like I said you are expecting just a little bit more even if it is still seafood give me just at least a couple of more shrimp in there el pollo loco other than that solid all right so here comes the obvious question did this one look pretty solid to you do me a quick favor drop some comments down below first things first are you a fan of street tacos and if you are how authentic did this one look to you in terms of being a street taco drop those comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K closing out another episode of peep this out bringing you brand new content every single week here on my channel so while you stay tuned for the next review
