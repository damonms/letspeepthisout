 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K  ay stay frosty what's going on everyone and   welcome to the channel where today I'm back on  over at Pizza Hut to check out another one of   their all-new melts and judging by what I'm about  to get into right now let's just say I think this   is going to be one meaty situation yeah definitely  one meaty situation this is looking pretty awesome   guys Feast your eyes on the meat lovers melt  here at Pizza Hut a very crispy situation on the   outside and it looks like it's absolutely loaded  with the good stuff on the inside let's break this   one on down real quick yeah the presentation  is killer on this one all right so what we've   got here are two slices of their thin and crispy  crust and in this case it's filled with pepperoni   ham pork beef Italian sausage and bacon this is  definitely a carnivorous Lover's Dream guys and   it looks really really awesome definitely packed  to the gills and it's looking really really great   and aside from the crispiness on the outside I'm  totally digging that parmesan dusting that it's   got on the very top there for dipping we've got  a side of their marinara sauce guys so you know   we're going to be getting into that one you got to  have something to dip into and that's definitely   looking pretty nice as well but guys coming back  to the presentation here this meat lovers melt   looks like it's going to satisfy a carnivorous  Lover's Dream ASAP with lots of goodness so let's   not waste any more time on this one we gotta see  if it's gonna deliver this is the all-new meat   lovers melt part of the all-new melts lineup  here at Pizza Hut let's peep out this flavor   yes sir right out the gate this is looking  pretty awesome and for $6.99 I have a feeling   already this is going to be money well spent  Guys these are looking really really great   and the size is pretty decent as well okay let  me pick up one of these pieces here wow a very   lovely situation of meaty goodness look at  that cheese hanging right there there is a   lot of goodness on the inside of this one guys  and again the crispiness is on point I'm totally   digging that parmesan dusting in the very top  and the thinness of the crispiness and the just   the overall deliciousness that I'm looking at  here right now feels really really awesome so   without further Ado here we go guys it's the meat  lovers melt here at Pizza Hut let's peep this out mmm oh man come on right off the break that  thin and crispy crust completely sets the   tone for what you're about to get into  here guys and what you're about to get   into is a lot of meaty cheesy goodness this  thing is stacked on the inside I'm tasting   everything with this just the right amount of  saltiness it's not too crazy over the top but   I'm totally digging hell almost it feels like  a flash fry with this thin and crispy crust   almost like a wonton believe it or not this is  very well put together very delicious on this   let's go for another bite and of course we're  gonna get in some sauce it's pretty banging mmm yup yup crazy delicious on this one guys a  very solid amount of cheese on the inside and   plenty of meat as you can see a meat lover's dream  come true this really is this is everything they   pretty much have on the menu here and it's all  encased in this beautifully toasty and crispy   thin crust right here of course dusted with that  little garlic and Parmesan action on the very   outside but guys very decadent very flavorful  and again already $6.99 this is definitely a   solid price for this it really is yeah I was so  looking forward to trying this version of these   melts over here at Pizza Hut after checking out  the chicken bacon parmesan which you're probably   seeing jumping up on your screen here right now  guys that was a very lovely situation as well but   this one easily trumps it because of the amount  of meat on the inside just a lovely situation   in general and again with the crispiness on the  outside I got to keep showing it to you it is   made extremely well this is just a banging variant  of these all new melts and again for $6.99 I'm not   hating on that at all this is a pretty good value  so far all right so let's see if I can kick this   one up a notch with some of their pizza sauce and  as you guys know they're not putting any sauce on   the inside of these because they want you to dip  into it so you can taste all those toppings with   this crust here it's really really good so  let's get a nice little coating completely   three of them for you let's give this a shot  very tasty looking already let's bang it out mmm man there is so much flavor coming from the  Italian sausage the pork and the beef and   when you combine that with everything on the  inside of this and of course with the marinara   sauce the dipping action you're getting a  little bit of sweetness and a little bit   of tartness added with the overall flavor of  this tomato goodness but guys the combination   is pretty amazing and of course the crunchiness  and everything you're getting here this is a very   hearty version of the Melt and it really does  live up to that name for meat lovers a total   banging situation right now and again I'm so  glad to be filming this this is really tasty   all right so let's go for one more bite to  wrap this review up with the rating coming   up next but guys one more time we're gonna go  for another dunk and of course I'll give you   some more close-ups as we go further on down  but guys very delicious on this one hopefully   that focus is staying focused as you can see a  very lovely situation and again it is very much   packed and I'm totally digging this experience  one more bite and we'll wrap this one up hang on well let me give you a shot of the other half here  guys and as you can see it really does kind of   look like just a folded up slice of pizza doesn't  it I mean it's really cool the way it's designed   and of course with all the meaty goodness here  I have never had a Pizza Hut pizza that has had   this much toppings on the inside and I gotta say  it looks really great like this and of course it   dovetails beautifully with the crispiness on the  outside the parmesan the garlic goodness overall   a very nice combination of goodness here and of  course when you dip it into some of that marinara   sauce you've got a lot to look forward to very  awesome on this one so with that said I'm gonna   have to give the meat lovers melt here at Pizza  Hut part of their all new melts lineup the obvious   10 out of 10 guys truth be told this is going to  be very hard to top out of the other two that I'm   going to be taking a look at here on the channel  and just so you guys know there are a few others   available on the menu like I mentioned in the last  review so of course look forward to checking those   out in the future here on the channel but when it  comes to this meat lovers action guys like I said   that name is completely warranted it is packed to  the gills with the meaty goodness a solid amount   of cheese on the inside and overall it dovetails  beautifully with a thin and crispy crust that it's   got almost like a wonton flash fry and I gotta  admit I totally dig it pair that up with that   sauce like I mentioned a
