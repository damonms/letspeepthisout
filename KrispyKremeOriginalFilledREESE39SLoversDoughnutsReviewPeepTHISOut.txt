 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty hey guys I'm back at it this time outside of Krispy Kreme here locally and I'm checking out the brand new Reese's lovers original filled Donuts here guys this is actually a very very cool partnership with Reese's and Krispy Kreme what these basically are are two special donuts chocolate filled as you guys can see here definitely a solid situation they are glazed very nicely filled with peanut butter cream and a little bit of a peanut butter drizzle on one of them here chocolate on the other with additional peanut butter goodness on top of that so let's not waste any more time on this one because it's literally over a hundred plus degrees and I'm outside of Krispy Kreme still right now with a hat on no less dying right now in the heat we're gonna get into the chocolate one first this is looking very very lovely these original filled normally have this Twinkie like cream on the inside but in this case it's got peanut butter goodness let's go for a quick bite or two on this one and give it a shot mmm oh that is very thick and very rich Wow the cream is heavy on this one heavy peanut butter I can barely talk right now glazed goodness light soft Krispy Kreme doughnut action here that's pretty fantastic so yeah definitely thick on this one I'm gonna go for one more bite and then we're definitely gonna get into the regular peanut butter version but so far the chocolate lovers one pretty nice guys pretty nice mmm man very thick very sweet alright let's get into the other version the peanut butter glaze is legit on this one exactly the same stuff with the addition of the peanut butter glaze on the top instead of a chocolate and it's still the same peanut butter buttercream on the inside here we go Oh man peanut butter is my favorite straight through the glaze is strong it's got a really nice cream in the middle very very soft very creamy mostly on one side of this one actually but it's definitely standing out lovely situation mmm wow that is really really tasty flavor is pretty ridiculous and it's very very sweet alright so starting off with the peanut butter lovers version this is going to be my favorite and easy 9 out of 10 on this one is that classic Krispy Kreme goodness with the cream on the inside which is very very thick these original filled doughnuts are pretty bomb in general but a nice overall flavor and nice even flavor across-the-board lovely situation on that one as for the chocolate one this one's a little muted in terms of the chocolate flavor just like the original chocolate glaze when these first came out to me but I love the fact that you can see the color contrast pretty nicely with the cream on this particular one but overall flavor on this one will do a solid 8 because the flavor of the peanut butter really really stands out you really can't go wrong with either one of these and the fact that they come as a two pack in this collectors box is pretty awesome in general so pretty nice overall all right so with that as I'm literally melting away as we speak here drop some comments down below let me know if you're a fan of Reese's peanut butter cups
