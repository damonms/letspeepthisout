 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K  stay frosty what's going on everyone and welcome   to the channel where today I'm over at good old  Mickey D's to check out one tasty looking upgrade   to my all-time favorite burger over here that's  right you guessed it it's the quarter pounder   with cheese yes sir and apparently it's gonna  get a little smoky from what I understand guys   Feast your eyes on the Smoky BLT double qpc I'm  totally digging the look of this one right away   with that fresh beef right there in the middle  a lovely situation with the cheesy goodness   to go with it as well let's break this one on  down real quick man this is one tasty looking   Burger the presentation is looking really nice  starting off with the obvious we've got a very   nicely toasted sesame seed bun and once we pop  it underneath it looks like we have a generous   helping of what they're calling Smoky sauce along  with shredded lettuce there is plenty of that on   the top of this as we pan down you're going to see  the rest of this here guys Roma tomatoes we've got   some smoked bacon and that's all on top of two  100% fresh beef patties that are separated with   American cheese so a lovely situation essentially  a Double Quarter Pounder with cheese on steroids   and I gotta say this is looking Super Deluxe  really nice on this one underneath it it looks   like we've got more of that Smoky sauce so there  is no shortage from top to bottom and I'm totally   digging again the presentation of that fresh beef  a very lovely situation here so let's not waste   any more time on this one because I definitely  want to sink my teeth into it this is the all-new   Smoky BLT double qpc here at McDonald's let's  peep out this flavor and just in case you guys are   keeping score at home yes I am keeping the Roma  tomatoes on this one to give this a go because   honestly I've never really had a quarter pounder  with cheese deluxe that pretty much has the tomato   and lettuce anyway so this is going to be a first  but then again with the addition of the Smoky   sauce a very lovely situation I think I'm about  to get into here right now but real quick and   before I do that shout outs over to Robert Dyer a  fellow Foodie in the community that actually check   this one out I want to say in October of 2021 I  think it was a little over a year ago now it's   finally Nationwide Robert this one is definitely  for you let's see exactly how the flavor is going   to go on this one guys one last time it's  the all-new Smoky BLT double qpc you can do   a single but you got to do a double come on it's  a quarter pounder with cheese let's peep this out mmm juicy woah well right off the break the freshness  of those beef patties instantly stood out   it's super juicy guys as you can see glistening  in the sun right over there a lovely situation   and of course the combination of a half a pound  of beef with this one here before cooking two   quarter pound patties a lovely situation that  Smoky sauce is more Mayo based I mean I'm not   really hating it it's definitely got some Smoky  flavor to it but it's overall adding to the   overall experience Believe It or Not which  is the fresh beef and naturally the smoked   bacon on top of it you're getting lots of  smoky flavor with this let's keep going in mmm well one of those Roma tomatoes was giving me a  little bit of a problem there in that second bite   but guys the flavor is off the chart and again  you got to do the double if you do this burger   because you need all that beefy goodness it's  very thick very hearty the smokiness of the bacon   the American cheese it's a classic quarter pounder  with cheese the qpc goodness but with some lettuce   and tomatoes and naturally with that Smoky sauce  plenty of smoky flavor with this one it's pretty   nice and you know what on the real I gotta say it  really feels good to go in on a different version   of the classic burger over here at Mickey D's  considering they don't really do specialty Burgers   like they did so much in the past which I've got  plenty in the playlist that you're probably seeing   jumping up on the screen here right now there was  so much they used to do with different flavors   from different countries things like that with  this variation at least it's classic qpc goodness   with some Smoky flavor that's pretty much it along  with the I guess the deluxe version of the quarter   pounder with cheese with the lettuce and the  Tomato so pretty nice let's go for another couple   of bites on this guys again the fresh beef makes a  huge difference with this huge let's keep going in you know personally for me I totally dig  the fresh beef over here at Mickey D's which I'm   sure most of you guys do as well I mean there's  really no other way to have these Burgers over   here and again I'm holding out hope that the  Big Mac eventually switches to that but with   this I gotta say even with that Smoky flavor  it doesn't drown out the overall beefy flavor   of the beef itself over here and again as  I go around just to kind of show you here   a half pound of beefy goodness a very lovely  situation with the cheese action as well the   Smoky sauce is drowning out the cheese just a  little bit but at the same time the flavor does   feel different so it's not really tasting like  a classic quarter pounder with cheese naturally   because of the lettuce the cheese and the Smoky  sauce but still very flavorful nonetheless   all right so let's go for one more bite we'll  wrap the review with the rating coming up next   but guys again I gotta keep showing it to you  it is a lovely situation to do the double over   here at Mickey D's plenty of delicious beef flavor  to go with a very decent amount of the sauce top   and bottom a very lovely situation indeed let's go  for one more bite we'll wrap the review up hang on well I'm definitely digging the creaminess and  the overall smoked flavor of the sauce on this one   guys and as we go complete 360 on this one just to  give you the full picture indeed I gotta say it's   a nice addition it really dovetails beautifully  with the flavors of the beef and everything else   on this even if it is kind of drowning out the  cheese just a little bit but the overall flavor   of the beef is totally on display especially  with the double and it's an easy recommendation   to give this one a shot very lovely indeed  on this one I'd highly recommend doing so   so with that said I'm gonna have to give the  Smoky BLT double qpc I gotta say that's a lot   of fun to say as well a very solid 9 out of 10  guys I mean this is already winning with the fresh   beef and when you double up on it a half pound  of juicy goodness before cooking that dovetails   beautifully into everything else on that one  and like I said even though the cheese is kind of   drowned out because of the Smoky sauce top and  bottom will do that to you the flavor is pretty   nice along with the bacon of course the tomatoes  naturally if you're down with that I can take it   or leave it with them if I do get this one again  which I will I'll leave those off but with the   shredded lettuce and everything else on that like  I said the combination works extremely well on   top of their normal toasted sesame seed bun what  more could you ask for a pretty lovely situation   all right so do me a quick favor like always  drop some comments down below let me know if   the quarter pounder with cheese affectionately  known as the qpc is one of your favorite Burgers   if not your favorite burger over here at Mickey  D's and naturally if you've given the Smoky BLT   variation a shot what'd you personally think of it  drop those comments down below
