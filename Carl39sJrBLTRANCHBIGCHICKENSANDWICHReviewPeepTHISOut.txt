 hey everyone welcome back to another high quality  foodie feature for you here on the channel where   this time i'm over a good old carl's jr because  it looks like they're closing out 2020 with yet   another brand new chicken sandwich on their  menu that's right so stay tuned because the   blt ranch big chicken sandwich is up next welcome  to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty all right so let's get it going with the all-new  blt ranch chicken sandwich here at carl's jr   and as you can see we've got a nicely seasoned  chicken patty right there in the middle guys this   is looking pretty great starting us off we've got  a standard brioche style bun pretty much par for   the course with most fast food chicken sandwiches  underneath it a decent amount of ranch not too bad   there we've got two strips of bacon and obviously  guys the main star of the show that big chicken   fillet 100% white meat on the inside fried up  to a crispy golden brown looking pretty nice   underneath that we've got some lettuce we've got  some tomato a little bit more ranch on the bottom   and the bottom of the bun so pretty simple  ingredients list on this one guys and again   it's got some heft to it there aside  from the hefty price point for this   $7.99 i don't know about that but in terms of  the overall quality of what i'm holding here   it feels pretty substantial and that bacon really  looks pretty nice there guys let me just give   you a fast look at this again take a look at that  guys nice and crispy it looks fairly lean as well   let's give this a go it's the all-new blt ranch  big chicken sandwich here at carl's jr let's do it it is big well i will say right after the  initial softness and very very comfortable   mouth feel of that brioche style bun guys you go  right into the chicken and it is very very tender   and juicy i have to admit i'm a little surprised  by this right now i was hoping it was gonna be but   again very nice seasoning on this it's got just  the right amount of saltiness and fried coating   that i think is really going to satisfy a lot  of people who like fried chicken sandwiches and   i definitely do and i think most of you guys do as  well but overall guys i gotta say it's seasoned so   much i'm not really tasting anything else just  yet and the chicken is solid let me just give   you a fast look at what i'm looking at here solid  white meat guys that looks beautiful it's fairly   thick too so considering the price point on this  i was hoping it was going to be a big sandwich   and it really feels like it very nice situation  on this one let's keep going in pretty solid hmm man that's completely drowning out the  flavor of the tomato but now the ranch is coming   in there along with the hickory smoke of the  bacon guys it's two fairly large slices of bacon   which is pretty nice but again the star of the  show is easily that big chicken filet that is   really a bomb situation and it's got ranch and  i can always get behind that because ranch is   my all-time favorite with fried chicken and  this is definitely a bomb situation so let's   keep going in guys i am absolutely digging  this right now and i love the fact that   i'm actually having a blt with chicken and  the chicken is sizable this is pretty good i got to keep giving you the money shots on  this one guys take a look at the quality of   that chicken breast now granted this was actually  made in front of me right now they just dropped it   into the fryer and that was it so it was kind  of pre-made in a way but at the same time the   quality of that meat is banging on this one  guys and again the saltiness and that light   fried outer coating is really really awesome  as you can see by the thickness of the meat   i would probably say it's about 70% meat 30%  coating but lovely situation you know i've tried so   many chicken sandwiches throughout the year that  are really trying to go toe-to-toe with you know   who that i have to say i really love the fact that  competition is out there right now because there   are so many different variations of just a classic  fried chicken sandwich out there you have a lot   to choose from the fact that this has ranch on it  was the easy reason for me to get me over to give   this a shot but even still even with that tomato  i'm very impressed with the quality of this guys   very very delicious stuff let's go for a  couple more bites i'm definitely digging   it it's really sizable and even with this little  chicken sandwich diaper as you can see nothing's   really falling out the back but i love the fact  that it has the marketing and everything on it   it just feels like i'm having a carl's jr product  right now pretty cool stuff let's keep going in that chicken is good man you know i was  really hoping i wasn't going to be kind   of pseudo-brainwashed with this one because  on the very top of the box it actually is   promoting tender and juicy and i have to admit  i am absolutely digging it right now guys this   is really really good and a very impressive piece  of chicken it's not so much thick although it is   kind of thick as it is wide there is just a lot of  chicken here which is pretty awesome so sizeable   is definitely good but thankfully the flavor is  delivering on top of it so absolutely digging   this right now guys and like i said price point is  really the only thing that hurts this again $7.99   is expensive for a chicken sandwich especially a  fast food one considering the competition but i'm   so glad to have given this one a shot it is pretty  tasty all right so let's go for one more bite on   this one we'll close this one out after the rating  but guys a nice easy recommendation if you've got   carl's jr in the area this should be on your radar  right now it is really really solid pretty good   here we go all right let's try and do a little 360  with this one here because there's really not too   much falling out the back like i mentioned earlier  the ranch is kind of light on this one it's not   really there although it kind of is it's just a  little bit of a hint but it really is a showcase   of the big chicken filet here guys that really is  the main thing that's a little bit of the crunch   that you're getting from the lettuce and of course  that tomato and the bacon is a very nice accent   but just a lovely situation and again tender and  juicy on this chicken as you can see very nicely   done and it's high quality white meat solid stuff  guys solid now if only was just a little bit more   competitive in the price department you'd have  the best of both worlds but hey it is what it   is so with everything you've seen and heard right  now and based upon my initial experience with this   i'm gonna have to give the all-new blt ranch big  chicken sandwich here at carl's jr are pretty rock   solid 7.9 out of 10 this could have easily been  way up into the 8 category had the price been   a little bit less but even still even though it is  sizable there is a lot of other competitors out   there for a much cheaper price point that deliver  pretty awesome flavor as well although that one   is kind of on the basic side for the ingredients  list the quality of the chicken is banging so if   they can just bring the price down a little bit  and deliver the quality that i just had right   now that would be just an amazing situation but  guys still very worthy to check out at least one   time and especially to experience the big chicken  here at carl's jr if you've never done it before   that's a pretty awesome version to try especially  because it's got ranch and you know how i feel   about ranch right all right so i've got just one  question for you does this blt ranch big chicken   sandwich look like it's worth $7.99 to you i mean  would you pay over 8 bucks for something like   this even though the quality is pretty banging  drop those comments down below and definitely   let me know and with that this is Ian K closing  out another high quality foodie feature for you   here on peep this out reviews bringing you brand  new content every single week here on
