 hey everyone welcome back to another high quality  foodie feature for you here on the channel where   this time i'm over at shake shack because it looks  like they're testing out some new hotness that if   successful could be going national in the very  near future that's right you already know what   it is feast your eyes on their all-new buffalo  chicken sandwich and guys this thing is presenting   like a beast already look at the size of the  chicken patty on this it is looking awesome and   just a little threatening with that buffalo sauce  goodness all over it so breaking this one down   from top to bottom we've got that toasted potato  bun and underneath it again the star of the show   that crispy buffalo chicken breast antibiotic-free  hormone-free and i gotta say guys it is breaded up   and fried to a crispy golden brown and doused  in buffalo sauce galore this is looking really   really nice underneath it looks like we have  a generous portion of their shack ranch sauce   and shredded lettuce and that's it guys but  this looks like a combination of heat with a   little bit of coolness to go with and i gotta  say again the chicken looks fantastic on this   so let's not waste any more time on this one  it's the currently in test buffalo chicken   sandwich here at shake shack let's peep out this  flavor yeah this thing definitely looks insane and   let me just also say i'm so glad that we've got  the chicken sandwich diaper on the back of this   one just like the regular shack burgers over here  you've got that little catcher's mitt of goodness   in case anything falls out the back i've got  plenty of the shack ranch sauce and the shredded   lettuce to speak of here guys so i'm glad that  this has got this right now all right so here we   go one more time it's the all-new in-test buffalo  chicken sandwich here shake shack let's do it oh mmm hold on wow right off the break i didn't  get any of the shack ranch sauce just yet guys   that was a full front loaded bite of the chicken  and that buffalo sauce this is doused in right now   and guys it's a little on the steamy side as you'd  expect it to be it's got some elevated heat but   man the flavor is crazy take a look at this here  i got to show this to you i got to give myself   time to kind of recoup here guys just a lovely  situation the thickness of that white meat you can   see taking center stage it is a beautiful piece  of chicken and the breading on the outside is nice   very huge overall in flavor and the toastiness of  that potato bun on the top there is soft at the   same time goes nicely with the nice lettuce on the  bottom as well put that all together and you've   got a pretty delicious chicken sandwich here right  now this is pretty banging already and again i'm   super glad for this chicken sandwich diaper in  the very back it is really catching everything   here guys but let's go in for another bite on  this one it is super flavorful you'd expect   it to be at shake shack and their chicken shacks  are bomb over here anyway let's give this a shot mmm man the flavor is off the chart with this  i don't know how this can not go national at some   point i got a lot of the shack ranch sauce with  that one and a nice creamy coolness a little light   tang that i'm getting from it it was so amazing  with the buffalo sauce it's like a duality between   heat and cool at the same time with a lot of nice  crispy chicken action in the middle guys and again   a beautiful situation on the size of the  chicken just very hearty and very satisfying   but also very strong i mean the quality of the  buffalo sauce is definitely nice guys it feels   like a more upper scale version of buffalo sauce  it's got what i think is a little extra vinegar in   the sauce itself and that's elevating the heat  on top of the flavor guys but when you combine   that with that shack ranch sauce like i said the  duality of the heat and the coolness together   goes so amazing with everything here and again the  crispiness of that chicken it's a thick piece of   chicken as you're probably seeing on the screen  here right now just a lovely situation in the   presentation department yeah this buffalo sauce is  a banging situation for sure and i can understand   why they have it on a couple of other items here  on the menu for the limited time only right now   of course you've got that buffalo shroom which is  essentially the portobello mushroom stuffed with   cheddar cheese and muenster beautiful situation  indeed i can only imagine the heat on that and of   course you've got the buffalo chicken bites with a  side of the shack ranch sauce for dipping but guys   this is where it's at as far as i'm concerned  because the buffalo sauce with the chicken is   the way to go and again the quality of the chicken  antibiotic-free hormone-free it is super fresh and   as you can see breaded up nicely but with the meat  ratio being a lot higher than the breading i'm   digging that guys this looks like maybe 80% meat and 20% coating and that's just a lovely thing   indeed so yeah truly delicious stuff with this  one here right now and honestly i can assume this   is gonna be going national at some point in the  future because you gotta have a buffalo chicken   sandwich at some point if not permanently on the  menu as a limited time offering considering this   case is a test here in southern cali this needs  to go national shake shack if you're watching this   right now i think the writing's definitely on the  wall with this one get this one at least on the   menu to everybody i'm telling you they are going  to dig it beautiful stuff all right so let me go   for one more bite on this one because i definitely  want to take another shot at this absolutely and   then we'll wrap this review up after the rating  coming up but guys delicious stuff all around   and if you're in the glendale area here in  southern cali you need to be jumping on over   to shake shack to give this a go it is a banging  situation but i think you know that by now right   one more bite so one more shot of this one and all  of its chicken breast glory guys and again i can   say it more highly the buffalo sauce is a major  highlight with this one here and it complements   the light saltiness that i'm getting from the  chicken itself because of the outer coating pair   that up with that shack ranch sauce and you have  a nice combination of goodness and of course the   catcher's mitt style potato roll that this comes  on is also a highlight just delicious stuff all   around so jumping right to it i'm going to have to  give the currently in test buffalo chicken shack   here at shake shack which is what i think they're  personally going to call it because it absolutely   fits the obvious 10 out of 10 guys there is  nothing wrong with the sandwich at all it's   great as is if you want to maybe add pickles to  it for a little bit extra acidity snap and crunch   that would be a beautiful situation but that shack  ranch sauce aside from the buffalo sauce as well   is a beautiful combination and the thickness of  the chicken itself on top of it is awesome it   presents extremely well and it's very hearty to  dive into delicious stuff it really is all right   so now the obvious question because if you've made  it this far into the review i'd venture to guess   you're pretty excited about this buffalo chicken  sandwich over here at shake shack how excited   are you to give this one a shot do you want to  see something like this go
