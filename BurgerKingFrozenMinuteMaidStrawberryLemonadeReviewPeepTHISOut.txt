 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty hey everyone I'm back at it again this time here at BK on a not so sunny day here in Southern California right now to take a look at the latest frozen drink they've got on the menu and it's actually coming from the Minute Maid brand guys feast your eyes on the frozen strawberry lemonade a very inviting frosty looking cold beverage that is literally making my fingers numb as I'm holding this looking really really nice very interested to give this one a shot because I love lemonade and the idea of sweetening it up even further with strawberry definitely appeals to me let's give it a shot real fast ooh that is really really sweet hang on one second mmm I like this I like this a lot it's actually more lemonade and I prefer that actually than strawberry but it's got a nice little aftertaste that's really hanging with me right now that lemon is very very tart and I'm really diggin the fact that the sweetness is kind of even with it right now pretty refreshing mmm I think I like this better than the frosted frozen lemonade that I did a while back you guys can take a look at my BK playlist in the upper right hand corner every display right now that was actually pretty tasty that was coming from the Fanta brand I've never had a Minute Maid version of one of these things here at BK so I'm glad I'm checking this out right now and for a buck guys you can't beat that that is actually really really nice in terms of the size looks like about maybe a 16-ounce cup that they actually put these in it's the BK cafe goodness that you see on the outside there but very very nice guys very sweet and I'm really diggin the flavor on this mmm absolutely nice and frosty from the machine and it really is holding its own a few minutes into actually having this right now it's actually very nice mmm yeah I'm really diggin this the fact that it's more lemonade than anything else is really making me wonder why they didn't lead with lemonade strawberry but I guess strawberry lemonade rolls off the tongue a little bit better usually the first ingredient is the dominant one but I'm getting more lemonade and strawberry but the coloring is nice I'm digging the fact that the size is definitely right guys for a buck you really can't hate on it with springtime and summertime upon us right now this is definitely gonna keep me nice and cool all throughout the season and given the fact that it is a little bit on the sugary side of course everything in moderation definitely a nice treat to have and for a buck you really can't hate on this so with that said I'm gonna have to give the Minute Maid branded frozen strawberry lemonade here at BK a rock-solid 9 out of 10 I only wish the strawberry was just a little bit stronger on this one because even though I love lemonade I would love to see exactly what they're trying to push with this because of the dual flavoring but it's more lemonade to me at least than anything else but I'm diggin the color it's refreshing it's frosty and I'm definitely diggin the fact that it is just a buck guys that's a pretty good deal mmm so there you go just a quickie review on the latest frozen drink here at BK but do me a quick favor drop some comments down below are you a fan of the frozen drinks over here at BK and if you've had any of the ones in the past which are your favorite drop those comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K closing out another episode of peep this out bringing you brand new content every single week here on my channel so while you stay tuned for the next review coming real soon in the meantime stay frosty cuz after all with a drink like this you know I'm gonna tasty frozen goodness indeed hey guys here's to wishing you an awesome start to the summer season alright everyone until next time I'll talk to you soon
