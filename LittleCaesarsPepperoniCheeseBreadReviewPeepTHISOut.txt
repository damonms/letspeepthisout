eyes upon 10 slices of freshly baked dough topped off with a very nice blend of cheeses they've got that mozzarella and Muenster blend Italian seasoning and pepperoni so no sauce on this one it's more of an evolutionary step up from their Italian cheese bread but guys very scrumptious looking like I said and that smell is absolutely glorious right now it really really is crispy pepperonis and we are most definitely getting into this I can't wait anymore guys I think I've given you enough of a pan over shot here let's break into this one it's the pepperoni cheese bread and not-so-secret menu item here at Little Caesars let's peep out this flavor mmm that smells glorious the Italian seasoning on this is very very strong I'm digging that and speaking of hot out the oven guys it's literally over a hundred plus degrees as I'm filming this right now I pretty much feel like I'm in the oven let's give this a shot it's the pepperoni cheese bread semi unofficial secret menu item from Little Caesars mmm oh my god instant flavor mmm the light saltiness from that dusted Italian seasoning along with the saltiness from the cheese is instantly what I'm getting right away and of course that crispy crunchiness of the pepperonis on top of it guys and of course the dough very tasty situation let's keep going mmm so good yeah the real standout on this one is absolutely the Italian seasoning it's got just the right amount of saltiness to complement the cheesy goodness of that mozzarella and muenster cheese blend and of course the crispy caramelized edges on the very back of this I haven't even gotten to but you already know what to expect from that one the crunchiness is on the way but the pepperoni adds a nice dimension of flavor and even though it's not my all-time favorite meat for a pizza it really complements this version of the Italian cheese bread pretty nicely and with the overall flavor being pretty awesome right now it's doing an amazing distracting me from the fact that I am absolutely baking in my car right now I'm gonna keep going with this one guys because I really want to it's really good mmm man I'm not really missing the fact that there's no tomato sauce on this of course that would be more of a traditional deep dish style pizza here at Little Caesars if it had that but without it it really helps compliment the dough the cheese and the overall nice seasoning that this Italian cheese bread has on its own and of course with the pepperoni being a highlight it's a nice addition guys it really is man and the caramelized edge in the back of each slice is really the highlight to cap this one off but let's see if we can go a little further with it and go with that butter garlic goodness let's go for a dip the buttery aroma is strong with this one and I can't wait to see how it's gonna hopefully not clash with the Italian seasoning well maybe let's just say clash in a good way let's give it a go oh and in case you're wondering if the intensity of the aroma in my car right now is still there guys with this butter garlic situation I'm about to get into it feels like it's been kicked up at least four times higher than it was when I first began very very strong here we go mmm oh my god hold on oh my god oh my god oh my god I can't stop saying this this is insane mmm the Italian seasoning and this buttered garlic is a lethal combination guys that is just amazing situation the cheese on top of it and just the overall thickness of everything insane absolutely insane mmm it's so insane I gotta go in the third piece I hope you guys don't mind because I am having a blast checking this out right now don't let me forget the fact that the caramelized edges along with this butter garlic really make this a nice send-off when you get to the very back if you decide to wait till the very end but guys the quality of what I'm having right now is just off the chain and the butter garlic goodness along with those Italian seasonings I can't stop saying it is a crazy crazy potently lethal combination really good mmm man the light crispiness of that pepperoni mmm and the cheese on top of it I'm just gonna knock this one out and hopefully you guys don't mind so buttery so garlicky and I'm literally baking in my car right now and I don't mind man so good all right let's take one last big bite this is for you justin fast food pit stops right here let's do it mmm so let's finish this one out with a nice 360 shot of an end piece here guys as you can see a fairly thick amount of that fresh dough baked up very nicely and that caramelized edge goodness right there guys that is a real highlight these end pieces are absolutely a treat if you like the caramelized goodness and of course we have that pepperoni on the top nice and crispy plenty of the Italian dusting and on the very bottom which we haven't really taken a look at here nice and buttery guys this is just a really really delicious treat I would highly recommend having your local Little Caesars make this for you if it's not officially on the menu high recommendation guys very high recommendation so I'm not gonna make you guys wait too much longer on this one because I think you have a pretty good idea of what I'm gonna give this one right so with that said I'm gonna have to give the pepperoni cheese bread here at Little Caesars a rock-solid 10 out of 10 and how could you not after everything you just saw right now guys everything in this one on the ingredients list here combined to make a very beautiful situation that was only enhanced by the buttery garlic goodness the Italian seasoning was on point the cheese was on point I'm just a fan of mozzarella and Muenster cheese in general and even without the sauce on this one it was still highly delicious and the dough guys come on it's Detroit style so it's a little on the thick side definitely incredibly tasty but of course the obvious question is did this looks pretty tasty to you do me a fast favor drop some comments down below let me know if you've got this pepperoni cheese bread at your local Little Caesars and if you do how much does it cost for you drop those comments down below and definitely
