 hey everyone welcome back to another high quality  foodie feature here on the channel alright first   things first i've always had kind of a passing  interest in the veggie menu over at taco bell   but there really hasn't been a compelling reason  for me to really jump on over and give it a shot   i mean honestly it looked kind of plain pretty  much just black beans substituted in for either   chicken beef or steak and just a regular menu like  the crunchwrap a burrito a taco that type of thing   but with the return of the toasted cheddar chalupa  there's the push to really give this one a go   right now guys so since you already know based  upon the title to this review i'm headed into   taco bell right now and i'm going to be giving  their black bean toasted cheddar chalupa a shot   so stay tuned because it's up next welcome to  peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty hi how're you doing today good how you doing doing well thank you uh peep this out you know i've actually

$3.27 go ahead and drive forward thank you great thanks a lot  your welcome alright yeah so this one actually   looks pretty good but if you wanted to relive the  moment with me from the past take a

ya buh-bye   alright guys let's peep this out so here we  go with the black bean toasted cheddar chalupa   and just like before we've got a really awesome  looking chalupa shell featuring a very aromatic   blend of six months aged cheddar on the outside  nice and toasty and it smells fantastic on the   inside we got swapping out for the beef chicken  or steak we've got black beans on the bottom   lettuce tomatoes cheddar cheese and reduced fat  sour cream so essentially all the toppings on   any other item here now as the main event i gotta  say guys still it looks and smells fantastic so   let's not waste any more time on this one it's  the all new black bean toasted cheddar chalupa   part of the veggies craving menu here  at taco bell let's peep out this flavor   oh yeah and aromatic it is taco bell knows what's  up with this one guys they really know that aged   cheddar needs to stand out strong and it really  does take a look at that toasted goodness on   the outside that is looking fantastic and again  subbing out for the protein on the very bottom   there we've got those black beans and all  the other goodies that this regular toasted   cheddar chalupa has but man looking really really  dynamite so guys like always we're gonna start   this one off if you guys are fans of high quality  delicious looking food reviews make sure to hit   that subscribe button down below don't forget to  tap that bell icon so you can be notified as soon   as brand new content drops every week here we  go guys the black bean toasted cheddar chalupa   glad this is back in the menu man i know  this is going to be delicious let's do it mmm crunchy mmm a lot of sour cream in that oh  the black beans are coming through nice on this   that is really good feast your eyes on that  guys pretty plentiful on the very bottom   right there trying to stay focused in there's  a lot of stuff going on here but as you can see   the main highlight is easily going  to be that shell on the inside so   for a vegetarian option this is pretty  awesome it's very hearty to bite into   and those flavors are singing it's classic taco  bell let's keep going in this is really good you know i can't remember the last time i actually  had black beans over here at taco bell it may have   been maybe like a cantina burrito or something  maybe back in the day a power burrito i think it   did way back in the day when i was just starting  my channel out but guys so far the flavor on   this is pretty amazing i mean for a vegetarian  option this is a beautiful situation and again   the toastiness of the shell i really appreciate  the fact that i've got a sleeve in the very back   here because obviously this thing is a little  on the greasy side and my fingers are kind of   greasy but man the cheese is very strong like  i said the aromatic goodness is coming through   and that aged cheddar is sharp on it so the  slight thickness that i'm getting from the   actual shell itself you can see right there  that chalupa shell but man i am not missing   the other proteins at all with this and it's a  really really solid alternative and again like   i said classic taco bell for what you're used  to with all the other toppings this really is   like the accoutrement that pretty much goes on  anything else you would get here but with the   main event being black beans like i said i'm not  missing it let's keep going in it's really good just some of the beans that time smooth a little  bit of chew to them but the flavor is awesome   so yeah just a really really great alternative  and i gotta say guys again that toasted cheddar   chalupa i'm so glad this is back on the menu i had  such a blast checking that one out for the steak   variant the last time around i really enjoyed the  steak and i was one of the reasons i wanted to do   that version over a year ago but i'm so glad to  give the black bean version of it a shot over   here because like i said i'm not missing any of  the other proteins at all and it's very plentiful   $2.99 is not a bad deal for this and like i said  that toasted chalupa shell on the outside with   that aged cheddar is making this one an  extreme treat right now awesome stuff and   an easy recommendation but i think you know that  if you've made it this far into the review right   yeah like i said at the top of this review i've  always had a little bit of a passing interest   when it came to the veggie menu here at taco bell  i mean naturally having different protein options   is a plus but for vegetarians it definitely  is great to have those options available   and while for me personally i didn't really feel  motivated because naturally swapping out any other   type of protein in with a crunchwrap a burrito or  taco like i said it really just wasn't interesting   to me enough to really give this a go but with  the return of the toasted cheddar chalupa and   how awesome that is how bad could that have really  been right i'm so glad to have done this right now   and now that it's back in the menu i can easily  see myself going in on that one on occasion while   it's available so with that said i'm gonna have to  give the black bean toasted cheddar chalupa here   at taco bell a rock solid 9 out of 10 guys like i  said it really is kind of a topping showcase even   with those black beans being the main highlight  for the protein but everything else that you're   familiar with with taco bell aside from that  flavor really shines with the outer chalupa   shell on that one there and naturally with the  toasted aged cheddar not only is it aromatic the   flavor is primo just the right amount of saltiness  and just overall the crunchy factor very delicious   and like i said for $2.99 that's not bad at all alright so outside of the obvious question of asking   if you're super excited that the toasted cheddar  chalupa is back in the menu here at taco bell which   i'd venture to guess if you've made it this far  into the review you absolutely are are you equally   excited if not more so to give it a shot with  black beans drop those comments down below and   definitely let me know and with that this is  Ian K closing out another high quality foodie   feature for you here on peep this out reviews  bringing you brand new content every single   week here on my channel so
