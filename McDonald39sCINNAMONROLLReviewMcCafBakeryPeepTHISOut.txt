 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty all right everyone let's get it it's Ian K back  again with another high quality foodie feature   for you here on peep this out reviews this time  returning to good old mickey d's because it looks   like they're adding a trio of really tasty looking  mccafe bakery items to their menu and there's one   in particular that grabbed my attention as soon  as i saw it and as you can tell by the title to   this review it's their all-new cinnamon roll  and i gotta admit i think i'm in for one icy   situation here guys this is looking really great  what we've got here very simply is some buttery   pastry dough that's loaded with cinnamon and  then baked to a nice golden brown before it's   topped off with some cream cheese icing so guys  it looks really really great i got to admit   it's very very awesome in the car in the aroma  department this is smelling pretty fantastic   so let's not waste any more time on this  one it's the all-new cinnamon roll as part   of the mccafe bakery served all day here  at mcdonald's let's peep out this flavor   yeah cinnamon rolls are definitely one of my  favorite treats outside of a donut once in a while   and i have to admit the presentation on this is  very very solid guys again one more time the icing   looks really really great on this it's definitely  served very warm and i can really feel it in the   very bottom of this container here but really the  presentation is on point so this i think bodes   well for what i'm about to get into but before i  get into it and like

as brand new content drops   every week okay now they give you a knife and a  fork to go with this because obviously this is   served very very hot you want to make sure you  don't burn your fingers it's kind of cooled off   slightly but you know what we're just going to  go gangster with it i'm just going to pick this   up and give you a nice look at it i want to have  some fun with it and wow this is very icy take a   look at that guys a nice situation right there on  the very bottom crazy gooey cinnamon action here   this is looking really really fantastic here we  go the cinnamon roll all new as part of the mccafe   bakery here at mcdonald's oh and by the way did  you know it's served all day all right let's do it oh yeah oh yeah i'm getting that vibe of cinnabon  right now but it's not quite as sweet believe it   or not so i'm really surprised by that because  it looks like it's going to be very very sweet   lots of gooey goodness on the inside and  the layers of that pastry dough are in there   nice and buttery a little bit on  the flaky side but man that icing   is awesome the cream cheese icing is  off the chain let's go for another bite look at the bottom of this one are you getting  hungry yet because this is absolutely satisfying   a major sweet tooth right now guys the icing is  amazing on top of all the gooey cinnamon goodness   and again the flaky goodness that i'm getting  the butteriness of it all is really insane and   of course the very middle is the capper right  over there this is just a very very delicious   item right now and i'm glad i'm starting off  with this because it is crazy delicious and on   top of it being crazy delicious the price isn't  bad i mean the typical cinnabon is about five   bucks or so so at $2.69 you're getting something  that's maybe just a little bit smaller overall   but man does it satisfy the itch of what this  has so super delicious let's go for another bite man i'm so in love with this icing right now  it's so good you know as good as this is right   now i may have to swing on back to give that  apple fritter and the blueberry muffin a shot   as well they had those in the case when i was  there picking this one up and it did actually   look really really tasty so i wanted to start off  with this naturally because like i said cinnamon   rolls are one of my favorites and i'm so glad  that i did the quality is amazing on this all   right so i think you can tell i'm pretty much  enjoying this right now guys i mean the gooeyness   is pretty much on point the quality is pretty  amazing for what it is the price is decent as   well a little under three bucks you really can't  beat that let's go for one more bite we'll finish   this one up after the rating and i'll give you one  more close-up but guys super delicious let's do it right down the middle of this one so you can see  that nice little cascade of icing right there guys   lots of gooey goodness and like i said the quality  speaks for itself as you can see it's very sizable   and i have to admit the icing is a  major highlight on top of the cinnamon   nice and gooey and of course if you want to  eat this with a fork and a knife nothing wrong   with that but you really gotta go gangster with  it to really enjoy it as far as i'm concerned   this is really really great so with that said i'm  gonna have to give the all-new cinnamon roll here   at mcdonald's a rock solid 10 out of 10 this  absolutely delivered right out the gate guys   and it's going to be very hard to top this one  for sure because of the quality of what i just   had right now it's not as sweet as you think  it's going to be considering how much icing and   cinnamon is in that but the balance just works  with everything and again that buttery flaky   dough that it's made out of is such a beautiful  situation it's very hearty when you bite into it   and just super satisfying and hey like i said if  you want to use this with a knife and a fork go   for it but honestly go gangster with it pick it up  dive into it enjoy it it's totally worth your time   alright so now the obvious question are you  gonna be giving this one a shot personally for me   i don't see how you can considering you've made it  this far into the review you have to jump on over   to mickey d's and give this one a go and when you  do drop some comments down below let me know what   you thought of it and actually was it the same  price for you when you got it $2.69 or so drop those   comments down below and definitely let me know and  with
