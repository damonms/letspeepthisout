 hey everyone I'm back at it It's Ian K for peep this out reviews this time over a good old jack-in-the-box to check out something I missed out on the first time around and of course you know we're going big on it so stay tuned because the barbecue bacon triple cheeseburger is up next welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty so here we go with the barbecue bacon triple cheeseburger and at first glance this looks like a double but if you look very closely on the bottom there is a third patty of beef and we'll definitely get there in just a second starting off with this little bun we have on the top here looks like underneath it we've got some crispy bacon some of their award-winning barbecue sauce that they're calling it we've got some onion rings and of course we've got the trifecta of meat and cheese let's go down the line here take a look on the inside obviously we've got one patty two patties and the third patty on the very bottom there so a very basic build on this one just an extra patty compared to the double and a slice of cheese of course but this is looking pretty high and honestly it looks like maybe just a little bit more than a quarter pound of beef with this one here and again the value patty size goodness here guys crispy goodness obviously with the bacon and the onion rings let's get into it and see right now if this one's gonna deliver it looks pretty tasty it's the barbecue bacon triple cheeseburger here at jack-in-the-box let's peep out this flavor you know I'm not really sure how I missed this the first time around I don't know what was going on around that time when this was actually out but I'm glad that I waited till right now because the triple variant that this one is is gonna fit in very nicely with that quad chicken sandwich I did back in the day along with the quad bonus Jack recently as well because guys look at that there is really nothing like having a huge burger and Jack really knows how to do it right with these larger variants of their promo sandwiches looking pretty fantastic and we're definitely gonna get into it but first things first and like always you guys are fans of high-quality

barbecue bacon triple cheeseburger here at Jack finally let's do it mm-hmm oh so much beef oh man that's tasty alright so obviously a lot of beef a lot of cheese immediately and then also the crunch of the onion rings and a very nice tang of the barbecue sauce I'm not tasting the bacon just yet because I haven't really gotten to it but guys take a look at that that is a lovely situation very gluttonous and I got to admit I am digging the presentation of this one here softness of the bun as well I'm so glad we've got a little burger diaper here just in case anything falls out the back this is pretty big I'm glad I was able to get everything into my mouth with this one in that first bite here we go well minus the bacon anyway let's see if we can get some bacon this time around again I think I'm gonna go for it right over here let's do it uh-huh crispy bacon that is really good you know this is one of those cases where the extra patty does make the difference because a double would really kind of feel almost like a single anywhere else because of the thinness of the patties wouldn't you add that third bit of meat in this one along with the cheese lovely situation right there guys it's really coming through not super super juicy on the beef but the flavorfulness of that barbecue sauce is really taking this one up a notch and adding a little bit more moisture to it as well but guys let me just give you another look here it is a very lovely situation and for $5.49 ã la carte this is actually not a bad deal I mean you could go to combo route for $6.99 here in Southern Cal you get a small fry and a drink to go with this one here but for $5.49 on its own it's a pretty decently sized burger and the flavor is pretty awesome on it let's go for another bite on this one because I really want to the onion rings are pretty amazing on this let's do it mmm man that combo of the onion rings and the barbecue sauce is pretty amazing but I'm telling you the wild-card with this one believe it or not is the crispy bacon I know that one's kind of flopping right over there as you can see on the very end but the rest of it is standing up pretty nicely guys this is a very crispy piece of bacon and I got to admit it's adding a little bit of hickory smoked goodness to the overall flavor of everything this has got going there pretty good mmm man that was really good so yeah very tasty barbecue bacon cheeseburger will be here at Jack and I got to admit again three patties is definitely a bomb situation with this let's go for one more bite of this one and then we'll finish this one up after the rating for you guys pretty tasty well value patties are not once you stack this one up you definitely have a very meaty situation here guys it's a handful so I'm definitely glad we've got that burger diaper in the back and the quality of everything else on this is very tasty a very solid value overall even at $5.49 but at $6.99 for that promo definitely a good deal with those fries and a drink guys excellent excellent value with this one and a tasty one at that order on ubereats postmates and grubhub yeah definitely tasty goodness on that one so overall I'm gonna have to give the barbecue bacon triple cheeseburger I'll be here at jack-in-the-box a pretty rock-solid 8.8 out of 10 this was almost up on the 9 category had the meat itself in just a little bit juicier on its own I kind of like the natural juices that come from beef anyway and when you mix that with the barbecue sauce that would have been beautiful so a little overcooked on that but still very flavorful and everything else was amazing on it the crispiness of that bacon the onion rings everything overall value wise solid guys I would easily recommend this for you if you haven't had it already or if you have you definitely know what to expect from it because in triple form it's pretty bomb ok now the obvious question is have you had this one already drop some comments down below this is my first time giving this one a shot being that it's back on the menu over here but if you have given this one a try is it something that you think you would get again in triple form
