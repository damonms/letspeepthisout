 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty hey everyone welcome back to another high  quality foodie feature for you here on the   channel where this time i'm back on over a good  old mickey d's to go in an iconic classic for   the first time on the channel ever and guess  what it just happens to be on special too   that's right and as you already know it's the old  standby for many of you a favorite amongst a lot   i'm sure the filet o fish here at mcdonald's  and just as the season of lent is wrapping up   of course i had to give this one a shot guys  and already i gotta say i'm really digging the   way this looks in my hand here right now pretty  solid so starting off with the obvious it looks   like what we've got here is a value-sized bun  but once you pop it you're gonna see there is   no shortage of tartar sauce guys i'm definitely  thinking the amount of tartar on this for sure   and that's all sitting on the alaskan pollock  filet patty and as you can see looking nice and   crispy i have to admit the size does compliment  the bun but then again the bun is a little on the   small side and on the bottom you'll notice we've  got a half slice of american cheese and as we get   further into the review you'll find out exactly  why that is but guys i have to admit again not   a bad ingredients list on this one it's kind of  basic just tartar sauce and cheese and of course   the fish let's give this one a shot and see how  the flavor is gonna be so there you go it's the   iconic filet o fish and we're definitely gonna  peep this out and peep it out we shall definitely   dig in the thickness of that alaskan pollock  guys and considering the size of the bun looking   a little on the small side it's still filling it  out pretty nicely so it's definitely proportioned   with everything that you're seeing here and just  so you guys know also this is the first time i'm   having a fish fillet in literally like 15-20 years  no lie this feels like a brand new experience for   me right now and i can't wait to get into this  so here we go is what i'm hoping is going to be   some pretty tasty wild caught alaskan pollock as  part of the fish filet at mcdonald's let's do it yeah that's some pretty flaky alaskan pollock  goodness with that crispy outer coating and   plenty of tartar sauce on this guys just take a  look at this on the inside a very lovely situation   and with that cheese on the very bottom there  as well i'm not really tasting that believe it   or not i don't really think it needs to be  here but man a very nice simple ingredients   list on this one and the nice softness of the  bun as you can see it's got some height to it   especially on the top very lovely situation on  this there let's go for another bite pretty good oh yeah i think i see why a lot of you peeps  wanted me to give this a shot after all the other   fish reviews that i've been doing throughout the  last month or so so guys i guess i'm technically   saving the best for last right because this  really is pretty awesome over here i'm pretty   impressed with the flavor of this and like i  mentioned earlier considering the amount of   tartar sauce on this right now that's lending  very heavily to the overall flavor of this on   general but the flakiness of the actual fish  itself is really shining through and again i'm   going to keep showing this to you take a look at  that that's almost cooked perfectly guys a very   solid amount of wild caught alaskan pollock and i  got to admit i'm really loving the combination of   the flavor with that tartar sauce like i said that  cheese is non-existent on the bottom but from what   i'm tasting otherwise very lovely on this i see  why a lot of peeps like this one but i gotta be   honest this was only two dollars to get on fridays  right now so considering this is $4.99 normally   no bueno on that considering the size of this  one guys i mean the bun very very small and it   really is a small sandwich i would not pay five  dollars for this maybe it's a double but a single   no two dollars pretty awesome value let's go for  another couple of bites real quick pretty tasty oh and swinging on back to the cheese situation  real fast if you're wondering why there's only   a half slice of cheese in the fillet fish believe  it or not that's pretty much to not overpower the   flavor of the fish totally there i guess a half  slice of cheese is just mild enough i think where   it's not going to do anything to the flavor of  the fish personally for me i don't think it needs   to be there considering the amount of tartar sauce  that's on this but at the same time you're getting   a lot of goodness there to really kind of make  you feel like you don't need the cheese anyway   so i guess it's there for show it adds some color  overall but generally guys i don't think it really   needs to be there at all the flakiness of the fish  in the tartar is all you really need with this   if i ever get this again i probably will i'm not  gonna wait 15 to 20 years from this point probably   gonna say to leave the cheese off completely it's  not really needed all right so let's go for one   more bottom this one will close it up after the  rating but guys i'm so glad to have finally given   this a shot after so many years and officially  here on the channel here in 2021 let's go for it   well there you go with some certified sustainable  wild caught alaskan pollock guys and a very lovely   situation it is indeed i can see why this  is a favorite over here at mickey d's for   so many of you guys and not just during the  season of lent but year round but again $4.99   no bueno two bucks all the time if you ask  me that's exactly what this is worth it   really feels like more of an upper scale value  size sandwich especially the fish variety   but guys very very tasty glad to have given this  one a shot here on the channel so with that said   i'm gonna have to give the ever popular filet of  fish over here at mickey d's are pretty rock solid   7.5 out of 10 i'm not gonna go much  higher than that because fast food fish is not   my favorite but considering what this is this is  probably one of the upper tier variants that i've   tried and especially for mickey d's it's iconic  for a reason i don't think it really deserves   anything above that personally but the quality  of what you're getting is pretty solid and for   two bucks i should probably bump that to maybe  an 8.5 because the quality for that is pretty   good for two dollars outside of that no bueno  for five bucks but it's pretty tasty either way   because that is some quality fish in that sandwich  by far all right so i've got one basic question   for you outside of the season of lent given that  we're coming up on easter right now is the filet   o fish something that you actually get personally  throughout the year drop some comments down below   let me know if this is really your go-to fish  sandwich especially when it comes to fast food   and actually do you actually enjoy it with  the cheese do you taste it with the cheese   drop those comments down below and definitely  let me know and with that this is Ian K   closing out another high quality foodie feature  for you here on peep this out reviews bringing   you brand new content every single week here  on
