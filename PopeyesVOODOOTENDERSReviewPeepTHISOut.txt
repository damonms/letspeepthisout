 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty with Halloween right around the corner it looks like Popeyes is casting a spell on us with their latest promo and I have a feeling it's gonna be a pretty good spell considering how awesome this looks right now feast your eyes on the all new voodoo tenders here at Popeyes and I have to say the chives on the very top here really add a nice bit of color pop to this one I'm really diggin how this one looks for sure what you're looking at are three 100% white meat chicken tenders battered up and fried to a crispy golden-brown as always here at Popeyes and drizzled with this voodoo sauce which is a combination of sweet chili and garlic and again topped off with that chive action on the very top there again I'm really diggin that color decided to go with the regular fries on the side with this one and of course it comes with that biscuit you got to love that over here as well and for dipping obviously you know what the sauce is on top of this here they actually give it to you on the side as well so the voodoo sauce in effect we're gonna go for some dipping action and see exactly this is going to deliver that garlicky heat that this one is supposed to have but again I am really digging the chives on the top of this it looks really really awesome let's see if the flavors gonna deliver on it though it's the all new Voodoo tenders here at Popeyes let's peep out this flavor all right first off shout outs to my buddy the endorsement we were chatting recently and he actually got wind of this promo possibly being the very next thing that come out closer to Halloween and sure enough I went to my closest Popeyes location and there it was up on the window so make sure to hit up the endorsement at the channel link that

in here just really quick to see exactly how amazing this looks especially with the chives on there looking really really nice with that voodoo sauce looking really really awesome it's kind of reminiscent of those hot honey crunch tenders from back in the day drizzled with that goodness but the chives do add something to it all right so let's give this a shot it's the brand-new voodoo tenders here at Popeyes just in time for Halloween well right off the break aside from that nice crunch that it's got right in the beginning the sweet chilli is beginning to activate right now very nicely guys it's a very very rich sweet type of chilli sauce and then the heat begins to come up they're noticeably different but again it goes amazingly well with the outer coating of the chicken tender itself let's keep going mmm well the chives definitely add to this one in terms of the presentation without them I think this would pretty much look like those hot honey crunch tenders from back in the day the sauce is very similar in presentation and not alone but guys the heat that I'm getting from the sweet chili is a beautiful situation the sweetness goes amazingly well with it and then the heat comes up on the backend and of course with the chicken tender goodness from Popeyes themselves this one's a little heavily breaded as you can see but it really soaks up that sauce pretty nicely nice combination and again let me just say these chicken tenders are huge I mean guys that's a single tender right now that is a lovely situation loaded up with chives here and the drizzle is kind of soaking into the breading here but a nice combination of goodness all together in one shot all right let me break off a piece of this goodness right over here and we'll go for a dip directly into the Voodoo sauce let's see if we can kick that heat up just a little bit more all right hopefully you guys can see this just a little bit but there is lots of chili flakes on the inside of this one guys this one is gonna be heated I think just look at the color on that one the contrast is beautiful on it let's give this one a shot and I've got the end of this one sauced up beautifully right up to the chives right there here we go mmm sweet a little bit of sizzle it's trying it's trying but it's hanging back but the sizzle is beautiful on it that is noticeably different than any of the sauce I've had here it's really good mmm mmm man one more thing to mention before we finish this one out I wasn't given the option of either mild or spicy tenders when I ordered this and usually that's an option but given the fact that this does come with that voodoo sauce which delivers heat on its own I have a feeling that these are just the standard tenders and they're focusing on the sauce itself to deliver the heat but if you really wanted to get it spicy you may want to ask him if they could swap it out and make sure that the spicy tenders are there for you but either way that voodoo sauce is gonna deliver some nice sizzle guys and the flavor is pretty awesome on it very very tasty on this one well the Voodoo sauce is easily the star of the show with this one as it should be considering it's the name of the actual promo I mean the voodoo sauce really is awesome on its own and the chili is amazing on it there the sweetness is pretty decent as well it's a little bit up there but the heat that you get from it the sizzle that you get from it goes amazingly well with the chicken and obviously it's engineered to do just that pretty awesome so with that said I'm gonna have to give the all-new Voodoo tenders here at Popeyes a rock-solid 8.6 out of 10 I was very surprised when it actually dipped into the sauce directly that the heat didn't elevate as much as I wanted it to but it's a testament to the sauce itself because the little goes a long way that drizzle is enough for most people I gotta be honest guys you get a nice amount of sizzle and the sweetness is definitely there but a little bit of extra definitely goes a longer way because you get more of the sweetness just no real additional heat aside from that sizzle but it's still very good now the question at least for me anyway is this one gonna deliver personally for you drop some comments down below if you're a fan of spice to begin with how it started are you to give this sweet chili a shot over here at Popeye's drop those comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K closing out another episode of peep this out bringing you brand new content every single
