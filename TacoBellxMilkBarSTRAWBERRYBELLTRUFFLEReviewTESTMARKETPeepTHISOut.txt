 what's going on everyone and welcome to the  channel it's Ian K where today i'm over on   melrose avenue in los angeles california to check  out the collabo between milk bar and taco bell   that's right and you already know  so stay tuned because the strawberry   bell truffle is up next welcome to peep  this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty well i gotta say right off the bat these are  looking pretty cute already guys feast your   eyes on it here we go with the strawberry bell  truffle a collabo between milk bar and taco bell   and as you can see guys these are looking really  really nice they've got some pretty nice color   let's break these on down real quick well i'm  definitely digging the nice clean packaging on   this little two pack for $2.99 guys it's looking  pretty cool okay so what these truffles consist of   are vanilla cake that's decorated with strawberry  pieces and soaked in strawberry milk that's then   filled with a sweet corn fudge and then the whole  thing is finally capped off with a nice outer   coating a crispy salty coating with a little bit  of sweetness that's got strawberry sweet corn cake   coating and it's decorated with pieces of taco  bell's crunchy taco shell so guys a nice little   combination of taco bell goodness and some truffle  goodness with some fudge again the presentation is   very killer on these i can't wait to get into  them and of course we're going to do just that   these are the all new strawberry bell truffles the  collabo between the milk bar and taco bell let's   peep out this flavor yeah and again the packaging  is very cool on this guys i love the whole modern   look to this and as you can see very very clean  and on the inside and actually with the truffles   nice little smell of milk and strawberry actually  that's pretty cool let me lift one of these out of   here so you guys can take a look and i am totally  digging the fact that these are very very crispy   looking as you can see we've got some crushed  taco bell goodness on the outside the taco shell   and naturally with everything on  the inside i'm so curious to try   that fudge the corn fudge on the inside of this  one here so this is gonna be a little messy let   me try and do the best i can here i'll probably  have to hold this over the box just in case   here we go finally it's the strawberry bell  truffle the collabo let's give it a shot oh soft rich and dense oh man right off the bat  please go national with this please this is so   dense and rich the combination of the light  corn on the inside with that fudge is very   dense very creamy very rich with little  hints of strawberry but guys i am totally   loving the cake quality on this it is so  soft very decadent let's keep going in wow yeah they really nailed the fudge with this  one guys you can really taste that sweet corn   very nicely although i am still getting a white  chocolate vibe on the back end is that corn but   i'm totally digging the strawberry with the cake  it goes beautifully and the crunchies that you're   going to get on the outside of this that's vintage  taco bell right there you can actually taste the   corn shell of the taco goodness along with this  very very nice on this so far yeah this has all   the classic flavors that you would expect to find  with a hybrid between milk and taco bell guys i   mean the corn goodness on the inside really stands  out towards the end of everything as it's mixing   together and actually with the fudge goodness but  it's really more prevalent believe it or not on   the outside because of the crunchy taco shell and  again i am totally digging the way that these are   kind of dusted over here very cool think of it  almost like a captain crunch delight back in the   day which i had fun checking out that was a lot  of fun to do but guys this is absolutely upscale   very very nice let's go for another couple  of bites on this one guys very very tasty that fudge is banging on this well i totally get  why they're choosing milk to go in on this collabo   guys because naturally truffles are a major thing  on the menu over here very very cool in terms of   the shop it was my first time actually on the  inside of this particular one they have a lot   of cool things to look at a lot of cool things  to try and naturally when it comes to this   collabo i see it makes perfect sense now so very  lovely situation on this again totally digging   that vanilla cake guys i have to say i love the  strawberry action with this but it's that fudge   in the middle that's the wild card please please  please bring this national asap taco bell this   is very tasty one more bite we'll wrap the review  up with the rating coming up next but guys i'm so   glad i made the pilgrimage out to melrose this is  definitely worth checking out let's finish it out well don't let the small size fool you guys these  are very dense very filling i am so good after   that one right now i have to say i'm so glad to  have checked this one out the combination of the   strawberry along with the taco bell goodness  goes a very long way to really give you a very   fun hybrid dessert over here and i have to say  again please bring this out national this is   definitely something delicious something you got  to experience well worth the time to check out   all right so with that said i'm going to have  to give the strawberry bell truffle the collabo   between taco bell and milk bar a rock solid 10  out of 10 guys like i said the flavor delivers   across the board it really does feel like  an awesome hybrid type of dessert that you'd   expect to find in taco bell believe it or not  because of the flavors of the taco bell shell on   the outside really dovetailing into everything  else and then naturally with that fudge in the   middle the beautiful combination of the sweet corn  goodness with that really shows up beautifully but   again a little bit more of a white chocolate vibe  but i'm totally digging the moistness of the cake   and the overall flavor of the strawberry easily  something to check out and if you guys are in   the la area or anywhere where they're testing  this in your area definitely check it out it   is well worth the time pretty awesome all right  so do me a quick favor drop those comments down   below let me know what you thought of
