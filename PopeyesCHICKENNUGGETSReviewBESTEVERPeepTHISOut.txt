 hey everyone welcome back to another high  quality foodie feature for you here on the   channel where this time over at popeyes  because it looks like they finally got   nuggets on the menu now the question is are they  any good well stay tuned because they're up next   welcome to peep this out  reviews with ian k stay frosty so here we go with the long overdue popeyes  nuggets and as you can see we've got a lot of   fried goodness on the inside of this little box  guys this is looking and smelling like classic   popeyes already so what we've got here is an eight  piece order of boneless white meat battered up in   some buttermilk goodness and fried to a crispy  golden brown and of course it's got that classic   popeye's appearance and the aroma is definitely  setting this one off it looks pretty great   and while the size of the nuggets themselves sure  do seem a little uneven to me based upon what i've   got here right now the piece that i'm holding at  least is feeling kind of hefty so that's not too   bad there and since you can't have nuggets without  something to dip into i've got a couple of sauces   here my two all-time favorites mardi gras mustard  and blackened ranch so obviously that's going to   be a lovely situation once we get to it so let's  do just that these are the all-new nuggets here   at popeye's finally let's peep out this flavor  all right i got to be real with you like always   i'm not sure what the hype is about all this i  guess it's kind of cool to have nuggets on the   menu officially from popeyes but essentially  what this really feels like to me is chopped   up chicken tenders and that's essentially what  it looks like but even still it's popeyes it's   fried crispy goodness how bad could this really be  let's pull one of these up here again and really   guys it really feels like the end of one of the  chicken tenders that i reviewed a million times   over here let's give this a shot the quote  unquote all new popeyes nuggets let's do it yup it's good though and honestly i kind  of expected it to be it's popeyes naturally   it is pretty good though it really is i guess  when you think about it it doesn't take too   much for the marketing department to kind of  come up with a poster or a window graphic or   something that just says nuggets on it and  then take an existing tender and chop it up   basically and kind of go from there but guys  again that's essentially what this is this   is kind of fun to check out it's going to be  kind of a quickie let's go for one quick bite   and we'll start getting into some sauces here but  this is really pretty tasty still it's all right let's go for a cross-section shot and as you  can see it's an uneven piece of white meat so   it really shows that it's hand breaded in store  none of these are really exactly the same and   that's kind of a cool thing but again your mileage  may vary on the size and i'm going to show you a   couple of them here in just a second but as  you can see white meat solid goodness right   over here and of course with that crispy outer  coating pretty pretty tasty all right so for   our dipping sauce pleasure we're gonna start  off with a little mardi gras mustard action   one of my all-time favorites and honestly that  combination of like a little horseradish goodness   really goes amazing with the chicken over here  it's one of my all-time favorites for a reason   and that's pretty much the main reason because  the flavor is awesome with it but as you can see   it clings to it as always popeyes  is popeyes let's give it a shot it's like i'm reviewing a regular tender  meal with you guys in smaller form   but i'm not minding it because it's  popeyes so let's knock off this   little end of the nug itself here  and we'll get into something else   really good and like i mentioned before about some  of the sizes being uneven they count this as a nug   guys as you can see it's just a ripped piece of  chicken thrown in and this is one of the eight   so obviously your mileage may vary this  is the downside about something like this   i think i'd much rather still get a regular tender  meal because it's going to be guaranteed across   the board for the most part but obviously with  a few of these pieces being a little smaller   again it's okay but obviously you may want to  verify these in your box when you give this one   a shot just to make sure you don't get too many  smaller ones compared to the larger alright so   let's go for a little cool blackened ranch action  on a very steamy day here in southern cali right   now this should hopefully cool me down just a bit  and again one of my all-time favorite sauces as   i'm talking about all throughout this review love  the blackened ranch over here let's give this a   shot with one of these nugs quote unquote take  a look at that very nice situation let's do it say what you will about what they're  calling these this is still delicious   stuff with that blackened ranch man fried  goodness juicy white meat that is nice   and a fairly large size nugget as well  too pretty good and just to round this   out let's go for another glory shot over  here and get this one nicely dipped very   beautiful situation love all the light spicing  on this as well and the creamy coolness banging yup so yeah guys tasty stuff of course depending  upon your sauce of choice it's going to be that   much tastier for you and overall a cute little box  this actually comes in with little nugget action   on the outside and according to this y'all  never had nuggets like these before actually   i have it's called a chopped tender or the very  ends of tenders when i review these normally   it's the same old thing but even still  fun marketing and they can finally say   they have quote unquote nuggets on the menu  that's not bad so am i disappointed in this   not necessarily but of course i kind of knew what  i was getting into when i was gonna give this   one a shot and obviously my expectations were  satisfied because it's exactly what i expected   but even still it's juicy white meat fried to  a crispy golden brown it's that classic popeyes   flavor just a lovely situation now all we need  is a spicy variant i'm sure that's coming soon all right so with that said i'm gonna have to  give the quote-unquote new nuggets over here   at popeye's justin okay 7 out of 10 guys  like i said this is exactly like i expected it   to be just a chopped up tender pretty much with  the sauces that i'm used to over here but even   still in terms of marketing it's about an 8  or a 9 because they're drumming up the hype   for naturally and the fact that they're chopping  it up for you without you doing it on your own   that's the main thing that's all these really  are but even still i'm sure we'll get a spicy   variant at some point or some other variation  of them but even still expect the unexpected   no you know exactly what to expect with  this one guys it's exactly the same thing   all right so after everything you've seen and  heard in this review right now are you personally   excited to give this one a shot drop some comments  down below what are your thoughts on the quote   unquote new nuggets over here at popeyes how  different do you think those are gonna be when you   give them a shot and which sauces are you gonna  get them with
