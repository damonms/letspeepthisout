 all right so i think most of you guys know i have  what you would call a love-hate relationship when   it comes to reviewing over here at sonic i mean  generally the quality is fairly decent when i   do it but there are times when my local location  is a little bit of a challenge but nevertheless   i'm hoping this new limited time  only promo featuring their chop   house cheeseburger is going to be a pretty  good one so stay tuned because it's up next   welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty well all right this is already starting off good  in the presentation department guys feast your   eyes on the chop house cheeseburger over here  at sonic and i gotta say this is looking very   appetizing guys a very cheesy looking cheeseburger  for sure let's break this one on down real fast   so starting us off as an equally nice looking  toasted yet soft brioche style bun and once we   pop it you're going to see some of the new chop  house aioli that's supposed to deliver some pretty   incredible flavor from what i'm reading about this  one as we pan down it looks like we've got plenty   more of that aioli along with crispy onion strings  and that combination is already smelling pretty   aromatic here on the car guys underneath that it  looks like we have a slice of american cheese and   of course it's all on top of a 100% pure seasoned  beef patty and guys again looking fairly solid   across the board there as well the very bottom  of this one is finished out with another slice of   american cheese and i gotta say guys it looks very  hearty and definitely it's got some height to it   so let's not waste any more time on this one  let's see if this one's gonna deliver on that   flavor promise this is the all new chop house  cheeseburger here at sonic america's drive in   let's peep out this flavor well according  to sonic this is described as a montreal   style steak seasoned burger that when combined  with their new chop house aioli is supposed to   deliver some next level flavor but guys at  the very least this is still looking like a   very tasty cheeseburger nonetheless here we  go guys let's get into it it's the all-new   chop house cheeseburger here at sonic  america's drive-in let's peep this out oh wow well i don't want to say this is  spicy but it's definitely lighting up my   taste buds guys it almost feels like it's  got a little something kind of sizzling in   the background but not quite but the seasoning  is absolutely high on this one it's a little   on the salty side i think that has a lot to  do with the crispy onion strings on this one   but at the same time the beef is fairly juicy and  the cheese is nice and melty on this one guys and   of course it's set up very nicely with a very soft  brioche style bun very nice on this one but wow   like i said it's not so much spicy but my  taste buds are like lit up the back of my   mouth right now is definitely activated let's  go for another few on this one pretty good wow that second bite was even more heavily  seasoned than the first guys and it looks like   it's a steakhouse type of seasoning on this  one for sure and it's got a little bit more   peppery type of action to it but man it is very  very flavorful when you combine that with those   crispy onion strings i gotta say that's a very  lovely combination the meltiness of the cheese   is pretty bomb on it but guys overall a very  hearty cheeseburger for sure and it almost feels   like a double even though it's a single because  of everything packed into it this is very tasty   well shout outs to you sonic i was really  hoping this was going to be pretty tasty i   mean it looks pretty awesome in the advertising  part naturally but the seasoning i gotta say   is on point and again just to keep showing this  to you a very lovely situation of burger goodness   over here at sonic and like i said usually  it's hit or miss whenever i review over here   but thankfully my location really  came through this time this is very   very flavorful let's go for another couple  more bites in this guy it's pretty tasty yeah it's peppery and i guess i'm kind of getting  a little bit of a sit-down restaurant type of   vibe with this one here it really does feel a  little bit more like an upscale type of patty   to be honest guys even though it's probably  their regular one the 100% pure beef anyway   but still guys the quality is pretty good on  this and again a little bit more peppery but   the salt is a little bit up there but at  the same time the meltiness of the cheese   and everything else combination wise is  working very nicely that aioli i gotta say   it's got a little bit more garlicky action to me just a  little bit but it's very rich and very flavorful   guys very tasty on this and again i am impressed  this is actually a very tasty cheeseburger   all right so let's go for one more bite in this  one before we wrap the review up with the rating   coming up next but guys a very solid outing  over here at sonic today and i have to say   of all the burgers that i would hope this would  work out very nicely with thank god this is the   one right now because of all the burgers naturally  you'd want it to be this one since it's got some   really awesome flavor and they're advertising  this as truly something kind of new for them   and i'm so glad this worked out beautifully  today one more bite and we'll wrap it up hang on yes sir one of the most heavily seasoned  sonic burgers i have ever had and thankfully   it really is very flavorful and delivering  on that flavor promise and as you can see a   fairly juicy burger too guys that looks beautiful  right there along with the crispy onion strings   and of course that aioli action that  it's got here as well very nicely done   and easily something to check out  this is a very high recommendation   a beautifully delicious cheeseburger  now available for a limited time only so with that said i'm going to have to give the  new chop house cheeseburger here at sonic a very   solid 9 out of 10 easily one of my favorite  cheeseburgers over here at sonic for sure guys   and i have to say definitely very super flavorful  in terms of the seasoning on this particular one   while it's just a little on the salty side  it absolutely satisfies in overall flavor and   it's easily worth your time guys very delicious on  this one give this one a shot i think you're gonna   dig it alright so do me a quick favor drop some  comments down below let me know if you've given   this one a shot and if actually you think it's  one of the best burgers they've got on the menu i   mean naturally with the chop house aioli and that  seasoning across the board this does feel a
