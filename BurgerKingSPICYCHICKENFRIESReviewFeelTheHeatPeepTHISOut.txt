 get ready to fire up your taste buds here at BK  because the classic menu favorite's about to get   a heat little upgrade that's right guys I've got  the brand new Spicy Chicken Fries up next so stay   tuned because I'm Ian K and you're about  to peep this out welcome to peep this out reviews   with Ian K stay frosty yeah I think if there was  any doubt in terms of what I'm about to get into   here right now BK has pretty much settled it  in terms of what these are supposed to be guys   I mean hot hot hot firing up your taste buds that  whole situation here a very cool bit of marketing   for these all new spicy chicken fries and I gotta  say a very cool little package that these come in   here so let's get into these real quick and feast  your eyes on the goodness that I've got here I   mean they look like the classic chicken fries of  course but there's something a little bit more   special with this one obviously all right so what  I've got here is a nine piece order of white meat   that's breaded up and fried to a crispy golden  brown in the shape of classic French fries guys   and this one actually features a blend of spices  to kick up the heat just a bit and I gotta say   the combination of what that's supposed to be  should deliver the goodness I mean the crispy   goodness on the outside of these looks pretty  good and if you look closely at them they have   a little bit of spicy action on the outside of the  breading right there not bad guys not bad at all   for dipping you've got your choice of any of the  sauces here at BK but I went with zesty because   that's definitely a banging situation more on  that in just a bit but guys a nice combination of   crispy goodness and I'm hoping these are going to  deliver the heat I mean the package says so right   yeah most definitely does but as you can  see in the sunlight there it looks like   I have a little bit of a red tinge on these  as well so very very cool on these very nice   and again the shape of a classic French  Fry Guys and as you can see there yeah   definitely some red action with that  one I can see it here looking really   nice nice and crispy let's see if this  is going to deliver on the promise of   being hot though these are the all new Spicy  Chicken Fries here at BK let's peep this out they're hearty little suckers though fun to eat  there it goes a little bit of a delayed reaction   more of a peppery type of heat but that is  actually pretty nice guys as you can see it   seems like it's more of the pepper reaction on the  outside that's what's really standing out to me   and on the inside a little bit  of that white meat action well   it's beginning to pick up just a  little bit there let's keep going in super fun to eat though it's a nice little  upgrade to a classic over here at BK they've   been on the menu for so long these are pretty  good pretty tasty yeah what I'm getting mostly   with these is a peppery type of heat so nothing  is really standing out above and beyond that but   the nice crispiness of the outer coating works  very nicely with that white meat on the inside   it's fairly juicy these are pretty fresh and I  gotta say again that combination of the Heat and a   little bit of the crispy goodness goes a long way  pretty tasty on these and again super fun to eat   and of course with me being a super fan of the  marketing when it comes to the chickens fries in   particular I love collecting these boxes actually  because there's always something unique about them   and again I totally love the way this one looks  here very very cool just so you guys know in the   very back I'm sure most of you guys do there's  a little receptacle back here for the sauce and   that's actually what we're gonna get into right  now just to kind of keep it in position very slick   I decided to go with my favorite zesty sauce  a little bit of that horseradish action very   nice situation basically it's like onion ring  sauce is another term for it very very tasty   and I figured why not let's give it a go with the  chicken fry action as you can see very creamy so   let's get outfitted for battle that is actually  very slick in the very back here you've got your   own little uh I guess Little Portal for the  goodness right there that we're gonna be uh   getting delivered to us here let's go into  a little bit of that let's keep it in frame   as you can see very very lovely let's  give it a shot with some zesty sauce right away that is banging I mean don't get me  wrong I love ranch but this is a nice situation   of goodness right there guys very very nice hmm  oh yeah that goes so well fried crispy goodness   horseradish sauce a little bit of the extra heat  that I'm getting from that I'd probably recommend   you do that if you want to kick these up a little  bit further because it works extremely well like   I love to say because this does this combo is  working for me right now very very nice indeed   mmm yeah definitely nice let's go for another one  of these here real quick I am totally digging   the way that these look guys you can kind of see  that red tinge right there and again super super   fun you know going all the way back to the  very beginning with this one I think in 2014   um they had a fiery version which I did way back  in the day I've done just about every version of   the chicken fries here at BK do take a look at  that playlist that's popping up on your screen   here right now for BK specifically because you're  going to find all those reviews in there you'll   probably see a few of them jump up on the screen  here right now I've done just like I said pretty   much all of them from the Buffalo to the fiery to  the jalapeno believe they had of Cheetos variant not   a flaming hot Cheetos varying back in the day  I think that's something that needs to get on a   crispy pretzel which was pretty banging as well  too so a lovely situation of goodness and this   is no exception but I guess I'm getting shades of  that fiery version as you can see in the sunlight   there this is very similar to that I guess they're  just calling them spicy this time around but these   definitely have a little bit of heat the extra  zesty goodness is really kicking it up though I   really would recommend you do that if you want  even extra on this one it really works well   mmm it's so tasty and I gotta say in terms  of the value a nine piece order for $4.99   obviously it's a little bit of an elevated  price point but there is a two for eight I   believe coming out that you guys will be  able to get as well too so that would be   a better way to go so I guess like 18 of  them total nine piece orders times two   um for about eight bucks decent for what it is and  again super fun to eat so let's go for one more   bite we'll wrap the review with the rating coming  up next but a nice combination of goodness as the   cabin in my car begins to black out thanks to the  sunlight in front of me here right now but a very   fun combination of the classic chicken fries done  with a little bit of heat with a little bit of   extra heat thanks to that zesty action let's go  for one more bite we'll wrap this one up hang on well for those of you peeps who really dig  chicken fries to begin with you have a lot   to look forward to with this one considering it  has a little bit of that extra spice added for   good measure and naturally pairing it up with  your sauce of choice a nice little combination   guys something fun to check out and definitely  something worth going in on especially if you   like a little bit of heat with your chicken  this is a pretty nice little alternative   so with that said I'm gonna have to give the new  Spicy Chicken Fries here at BK a pretty solid 8.1   out of 10 guys it's a very solid upgrade compared  to what the chicken fries are normally which are   not bad so you're getting a little bit of extra  peppery heat even though it's a little bit   familiar compared to back in the day if you've  had jalapeno if you've had fiery you're going   to get a very similar type of burn it's nothing  crazy over the top but it does work just enough   and again it's a peppery type of heat pairing  it up with that zesty sauce is definitely the   way to go as far as I'm concerned based upon  my humble opinion anyway because like I said   that combination of the extra heat from the zesty  goodness the horseradish that it's got on top of   the peppery goodness of the chicken fries that's  a very nice combo something to go in on for sure   all right so do me a quick favor like always drop  those comments down below let me know if you're   going to be giving these spicy chicken fries a  shot over here BK I mean you have a couple of   months roughly to give them a go they're going to  be around for just a little bit but do drop those   comments down below let me know what you thought  of them
