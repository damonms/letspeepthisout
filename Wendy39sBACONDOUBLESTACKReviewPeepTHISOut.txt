 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty all right everyone let's get it it's Ian K back again with another high quality foodie feature for you here on peep this out reviews this time we're returning to wendy's because after checking out their awesome new pretzel bacon pub menu from last week which you guys can find on the wendy's playlist popping up on your screen right now i noticed they had a new version of the double stack available for a limited time only so i definitely wanted to check that out and as you can tell by the title to this one it's the bacon double stack and already i'm a little underwhelmed by the size of this burger but let's just get into it here it seems pretty tiny under the bun we've got a combination of ketchup mustard pickle onion cheese and obviously some applewood smoked bacon a little on the light side there and that's all on top of two tiny beef patties here fresh never frozen and again a little bit of the cheese in the middle separating it here but as you can see very very small absolutely a value size burger let's just see if the flavor is going to deliver on this one guys it does look pretty decent it's just a little on the small side it's the limited time only bacon double stack here at wendy's let's peep out this flavor all right right off the break three dollars and fifty cents for this and i gotta say guys i am a little underwhelmed with the size of this here i remember the regular double stack being a lot bigger than this and as you can see just with the size of this in my hand right now very very small i can see why this is part of the biggie meals that they've got going over here value size for sure let's just give it a shot and see how it is it's the bacon double stack here at wendy's let's give it a go well it's tasty it's fairly juicy it's just a little on the small side this really feels like a mini version of the double stack and as you'd expect lots of tasty goodness here at wendy's they definitely do their burgers right but i'm really digging the overall flavor of this one here now with the addition of bacon as you probably saw with that initial close-up it literally feels like a half strip of the half strip i mean it's very very small it doesn't really look like the picture and the advertising for it but the flavor is pretty tasty let's just keep going thing about wendy's though and it definitely extends beyond the fresh beef is the fresh ingredients you can really taste all the awesome condiments on this one guys the pickles especially are really really nice the crunch the snap the acidity that i love to say with these reviews is really on display with this one here i gotta say it really adds overall on top of the onions overall as well too but as you can see just a really tasty little double cheeseburger just a little on the small side and after that second bite i pretty much destroyed one of those halves of the applewood smoked bacon which is always on point over here at wendy's as well as you guys pretty much know let's just keep going with it guys it's just really really tasty yeah definitely tasty this is gonna be pretty much a quickie review guys but one final point on this one before we finish this one out i really like the fact that that ketchup mustard combination goes amazingly well with this in general because of the overall flavors that wendy's has with their beef you don't really need mayo with this being that i'm not really a fan of mayo anyway i'm really loving that overall combination it's simple for what it is but again the quality is absolutely there so just to round this one out as you can see we've got two semi-small patties here guys and i say semi-small because you're getting two of them so it feels like it's a little bit more stacked let's just go 360 as you can see really really tiny on this one it's not even maybe a quarter pound not even it's really really small as you can see the value size maybe a quarter of a quarter pound actually but the quality is good it's the wendy's flavor that you know and love a little bit of the applewood smoked bacon is a little bit of a tease because it's light but everything else really does deliver on this one it's just very very small that's pretty much it so overall i'm gonna have to give the limited time only bacon double stack here at wendy's just an okay 7 out of 10 the price point really kills this one and i can see why they really want you to do that biggie meal the five or six dollar version of it you can actually customize the regular double stack biggie value that they have over here and simply add bacon it's a dollar extra so it's six bucks here on the west coast if you go for that i believe it's like four nuggets some fries and a drink to go with it so it's not a bad deal for that but on its own $3.50 not really a good value for the size of what it is i'd probably want to spend a couple more dollars and get a much larger burger but still i was very glad to give this one a go it's been a while since i've actually had the double stack here at wendy's so that's one of the motivating factors to give this one a go and adding applewood smoked bacon on top of it was a major reason to give it a go okay so now the obvious question is the double stack one of your favorite burgers over here at wendy's i mean it's iconic it's been on the menu for so long but does the idea of adding applewood smoked bacon even if it's just maybe a half strip half of that possibly does that really entice you to give it a shot drop those comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K closing out another high quality foodie feature for you here on peep this out reviews bringing you brand new content every single week here on my channel so while you stay tuned for the next review coming real soon in the meantime stay frosty all right wendy's you know i love you and all but i think this one personally needs to be at least a dollar less a la carte just saying all right guys until next time i'll talk to you soon hey thanks for checking out another one of my reviews but just in case you didn't see the one before
