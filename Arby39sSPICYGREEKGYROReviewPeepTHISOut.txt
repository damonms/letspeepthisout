 you already know what it is it's Ian K back at it this time over at Arby's to take a look at an all new spicy variant of a classic menu favorite so stay tuned because the spicy Greek gyro is up next welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty so here we go with a spicy Greek gyro here at Arby's and right off the bat I'm getting nice notes of marinated gyro meat along with that creamy tzatziki sauce those are definitely the dominant players so far guys but as you can see this is looking really really packed starting off with that gyro flat bread pita goodness right over here let's take a look on the inside looks like we've got plenty of lettuce onions tomato that creamy tzatziki that you can see down there the marinated gyro meat which is plentiful as well and that red goodness that you're seeing there as well that is the spicy chili sauce that's what really takes this one up a notch in the heat department I'm thinking and I have a feeling the flavor is gonna deliver because the aroma is pretty awesome in the car right now so let's not waste any more time on this there's lots of goodness to get into and it is really really packed I'm diggin it already guys it's the spicy Greek gyro here at Arby's let's peep out this flavor yeah this thing definitely looks pretty awesome but be prepared you need a lot of napkins with this thing guys there is so much tzatziki sauce and that spicy chili sauce all over this year so let's just get into this right now but real quick before I do that and as this is beginning a drip if you guys are fans of high quality delicious looking

Greek gyro here at Arby's hmm oh that's hot that is pretty hot it's a very rich spicy sauce mmm and the creaminess of the tzatziki trying to bring it down but as you can see this thing is dripping all over the place tender meat on this one that gyro meat is nice and the thick chewiness of that gyro pita flatbread is pretty bomb as well this is pretty tasty guys but man that sizzle is really beginning to pick up right now let's go for another bite I'll give you a quick close-up we're gonna keep going with this guys it's pretty tasty mm-hmm let me grab a quick napkin because this is really insane right now guys have a look at that spicy goodness right there that is just an amazing situation it's very very spicy and I'm really diggin the fact that it's blending so nicely with the tzatziki sauce that you can see kind of dripping on the bottom there but a nice combination mmm like I said it's super messy I'm just gonna keep this in the very back here guys but it's really really good let's keep going with it mmm it's completely killing the flavor of the tomatoes which I really like as well and speaking of the veggies the crunch of those onions is pretty amazing the lettuce is completely soggy because of all the sauce on this all that tzatziki goodness all the spicy goodness in there you can really tell they do not skimp on it guys this is really pretty awesome and I'm so glad I've got plenty of napkins here and I'm wearing white shorts right now on top of it what am I thinking right what am I thinking let's go for another bite of this we'll give you one last close-up but guys it really is pretty tasty if you're a fan of the Greek gyro over here already you have a lot to look forward to in addition to the turkey version and the regular roast beef too this is a nice addition good stuff so as you can see it's a pretty tasty looking gyro with the combination of that spicy chili sauce and that's tzatziki it's a nice combination of cool and hot but mostly hot I'm diggin it and I really do like the chewiness of that fajita gyro style flatbread as well this is just really really tasty and again with all the other veggies just a tasty variation of a popular classic on the menu over here at Arby's great stuff oh and did I mention that it's spicy and of course I forgot a drink as usual on top of it being semi hot in Southern Cali here right now so if you guys are curious on the heat scale of what I'm thinking of this one here on a scale of 1 to 10 I'd probably say it's maybe closer to a high 6 or 7 it's definitely heated and it's staying with me as I'm going here it's a nice residual burn in the back of my throat but guys nice quality and again a lot of tasty meat how could you go wrong with that so with that said I'm gonna have to give the all-new spicy Greek gyro here at Arby's a pretty rock-solid 9 out of 10 the only way this could have been a 10 out of 10 is maybe dialing back a little bit on those two sauces just a little bit and maybe including like a gyro diaper in the back of it cuz guys it's super messy and that's really the only thing but flavorful don't get me wrong it's absolutely worth your time now the obvious question at least to me anyway is are you gonna give this one your time do me a quick favor drop some comments down below are you a fan of gyros in general over here at Arby's and if you are how do you actually pronounce it "year-o" or gyro drop those comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K closing out another episode of peep this out bringing you brand new
