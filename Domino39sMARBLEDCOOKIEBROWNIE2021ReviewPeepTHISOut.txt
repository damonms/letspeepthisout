 what's going on everyone and welcome back to  another high quality foodie feature for you   here on the channel where this time i'm over at  domino's to check out the only other dessert i   haven't tried just yet as well as to add it to the  domino's food reviews playlist here on my channel   that's right i'm finally doing it so stay tuned  because the marbled cookie brownie is up next   welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty so here it is the marbled cookie brownie here at  domino's let me start this one off by saying as   soon as you pop the top on this one you're gonna  get a nice blast of cookie and fudge brownie   goodness immediately i gotta say guys it really  looks and smells pretty tasty all right so i might   have given this one away just a little bit what  we've got here is a gooey blend of milk chocolate   chunk cookies and fudge brownies together guys and  i gotta say that combination is very distinct you   can smell the cookies you can smell the brownie  action and the fresh baked goodness is absolutely   insane like i said this thing is wafting around  big time and it smells absolutely decadent so   decadent in fact that it's super hot as well just  picking up one piece of this right now it's kind   of burning the bottoms of my fingers guys but even  still the quality is pretty nice so far it feels   pretty dense and these nine pieces of gloriousness  are definitely waiting for me to jump into this is   really looking and smelling like i said pretty  fantastic all right so let's not waste any   more time on this one this is the marbled cookie  brownie from domino's let's peep out this flavor   yes sir nine nicely sliced chunks of deliciousness  right there guys a pretty even mix of brownie and   cookie and again the aroma is absolutely  insane right now in my car i am so digging   this here let me pick up one of these again  very hot in the hands this is just minutes   old and i gotta say a nice combination a nice  ratio of brownie to cookie action right there   let's give this a shot guys it's the marbled  cookie brownie from domino's let's do it oh oh man i can't do more than one piece  of this i can tell that's dense mmm good though   just the right amount of sweetness and  denseness overall guys i got a nice chunk   of the cookie action along with the fudge  on this one and this is very very decadent   i gotta say the gooeyness is absolutely there  the fudge is very thick tasting because it's   actually mixed into the batter here and again  very nice in terms of the overall thickness   very hot to hold this one still right  now you can kind of see the very bottom   the oily goodness right there how they prepare  this it's actually very cool and again very very   slick cool as in the flavor but not exactly cool  in my hand right now let's just keep going in man at 200 calories a pop for one of these pieces  i'm tasting that instantly this is very rich   it's almost like you're getting a gooey cookie  surprise in the middle surrounded by beautiful   fudge brownie action this is just very well done  and i'm really sorry that i waited this long to   do this but i'm glad that i finally am this is  definitely going to be something nice to add   to the playlist but even still like i said high  quality high thickness in terms of the denseness   on top of it and a very nice amount of sweetness  on top it's not over the top sweet but guys   just beautiful combination in general you know i  actually like this one a lot more compared to the   chocolate lava cakes that i checked out recently  which you're probably seeing jumping up on your   screen here right now i guess the combination  of brownie and cookie for me is really what's   doing it you're getting a nice duality in terms of  the flavor profile so it's not just in your face   chocolate which is nothing wrong with that either  but even still what you're getting with this is a   nice combination of that gooey chocolate cookie  as well as the fudge brownie itself very tasty   and it's not just the chocolateness of the  cookie itself it's just the overall denseness   of that cookie along with the rich chocolate that  it's got on top of the brownie guys so again one   last time with this one before we go for that  final close-up again a very lovely situation i   want to just keep showing this to you here this is  really really nice and like i said the combination   works amazingly well there's a reason why this  is on the menu for as long as it is a domino's   and i can easily see why all right so let's go for  one more bite on this one and then we'll wrap the   review up with the rating coming up next but guys  again very luscious very decadent and easily worth   the seven bucks for the nine pieces that i've  got here it's just pretty filling it really is all right so here's a nice shot of the middle  piece guys this is pretty much the creme de   la creme of it all as you can see here nice  chunks of chocolate all throughout this one   here in terms of that fudge brownie action and  again plenty of the cookie mixture as well just   a very nice combination and as you can see  it's buttery it's rich and it's definitely   filling if you guys like chocolate and i have  a feeling you do if you've made it this far in   as well as chewy chocolate chip cookies this  should easily be on your radar if it isn't already   very tasty yes sir i'm just gonna have to jump  right to it because i think the score should   be pretty obvious with everything you've seen and  heard me talk about throughout my review right now   i'm gonna have to give this marbled cookie brownie  here at domino's a pretty rock solid 10 out of 10   i mean guys how could i not it's a beautiful  combination of a gooey chocolate chip cookie   mixed with a nice fudge brownie and i gotta  say that combination is a beautiful situation   nice butteriness across the board in terms  of the overall flavor it feels very dense   when you bite into it and at seven dollars it's  not bad for the nine pieces there like i said   i really can't do more than one piece of that but  hey i'm super glad to have finally added this one   to the domino's food reviews playlist here on my  channel very delicious guys i'm definitely gonna   be getting that one again all right so being that  this is actually a menu
