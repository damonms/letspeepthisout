 hey everyone welcome back to another high quality  foodie feature for you here on the channel where   this time i'm back on over at carl's jr  early in the AM this time to check out the   breakfast variant of their all-new hand-breaded  chicken so without further ado here we go with   the hand-breaded chicken and waffle breakfast  sandwich an initial first impressions guys the   waffle is a little on the light side in terms  of thickness it's looking a little thin but the   chicken does look pretty good let's pop it and  take a look underneath and it looks like i've   got a nice amount of their all new maple butter  glaze lighting at the bottom of this waffle and   especially on top of the chicken itself guys i'm  thinking the appearance of this one so again what   the main star of the show is here aside from  the maple glaze is that all white meat hand   breaded chicken breast filet dusted in southern  seasonings guys and i gotta say it is looking   really really nice underneath it looks like there  is nothing there but again the waffle is a little   on the small side and the chicken is not too huge  not too small pretty much right in the middle   so let's see if the flavor is going to deliver  on this one this is the all new hand breaded   chicken and waffle breakfast sandwich here at  carl's jr let's peep out this flavor well this   is not quite looking as thick as it does on the  poster but then again it does smell pretty great   guys and considering the crispiness of that hand  breaded chicken i am definitely digging that the   aroma of that maple butter glaze is definitely  lighting this one up my only gripe with it so   far aside from the price point which we'll  get into is just the thinness of the belgian   waffles themselves but let's just give it a shot  because obviously that's why we're here right this   is the all-new hand breaded chicken and waffle  breakfast sandwich here at carl's jr let's do it hmm our chicken is juicy though it's good   well the quality of the chicken is definitely  apparent of course with the ham breaded goodness   being done in store you'd expect it to be nice and  juicy nice and crispy and this is definitely that   the only thing is though the size of the  chicken is a little on the small side still   i mean i'm biting into it and it's hearty and all  but at the same time just a little on the small   side but the sweetness that i'm getting from  the maple butter glaze along with the waffles   is a nice combination guys pretty tasty for  a breakfast alternative let's keep going in   hmm definitely digging that though let's go for  another shot of this one here and guys even though   they're saying this one is supposedly dusted in  southern spicing i'm not really getting anything   above a nice little fried coating on this here  but the juiciness of the white meat is pretty   banging and that maple butter glaze is a major  highlight here it's a nice combination i think   with the waffles i just wish the waffle itself was  a little on the thicker side i mean this really   is very small but even still guys the quality  of the chicken is the highlight with this one   on top of that maple butter glaze pretty nice but  let me be real as always guys the price point is   not nice on this at $5.99 just for this by itself  without a drink without anything on the side   it's expensive and that's the only thing my only  gripe with carl's lately especially here on the   west coast it's typically two or three dollars  more than it needs to be for what this is so   competitive wise in terms of price it's not quite  there but the quality of the chicken is nice guys   and again the maple butter glaze a major highlight  aside from the waffles which again i wish was   just a little bit on the thicker side still  pretty tasty let's go for a couple more bites yeah it's just a nice piece of chicken guys i  mean the chicken breast quality is definitely a   step up like i said and that's the main highlight  with this one and just so you guys know they no   longer offer the big chicken over here at carl's  because they've migrated over to this hand breaded   chicken as well so i had a chance to check  out a variant of that not that long ago i'll   make sure to pop that review up on your screen  here right now so you can take a look at that   i gotta admit as much as i'm gonna miss the big  chicken over here at carl's jr this is a pretty   nice alternative i'm sure we're gonna see some  other variations of this as time goes by but   even still i just wish the chicken itself  was just a little bit thicker and a little   bit more competitive in terms of the price  point this really is pretty tasty because of   the maple butter glaze but at the same time  it's six bucks just for the sandwich itself   it's asking a lot it really is so quality of  the chicken aside i'm definitely digging that of   course but let's just go for one more bite we'll  close it up after the rating but even still guys   like i said the quality of what you're gonna get  for breakfast at least over here for carl's jr   with this variation is decent but the price point  needs to come down it just needs to one more bite man my fingers are lit up with that maple butter  glaze right now guys but it really is a nice   highlight on top of the quality of the chicken  and while the waffle itself is a little on the   thin side i do like the fact that it's fairly  crispy even though maybe just a little bit more   so with my variation of it here but even still the  ham breaded chicken is pretty nice the quality is   good you can taste that right away but again the  price point is kind of killing this one but even   still definitely worth checking out at least once  so yeah i'm definitely digging the quality of the   ham breaded chicken over here carl's jr but that  price point is absolutely killing it right now   especially for breakfast so with everything you've  seen and heard of my review up to this point   i'm gonna have to give the hand breaded chicken  and waffle breakfast sandwich here at carl's jr   just in okay 7 out of 10strictly  because the price point is way too high   and the thinness of that waffle i think could have  been beefed up just a little bit to be honest guys   but even still the maple butter glaze is really  a highlight that really accentuates the overall   flavor of the chicken itself and that really  is what stands out here but again that price   point is just killing it all right so i've got one  basic question for you price point aside are you   still gonna be giving this one a shot drop some  comments down below and when you do let me know   what you thought of it overall if it was worth the  price point for you did you pay the price that i   did $5.99 for it drop those comments down below  and definitely let me know and with that this is   ian k closing out another high quality foodie  feature for you here
