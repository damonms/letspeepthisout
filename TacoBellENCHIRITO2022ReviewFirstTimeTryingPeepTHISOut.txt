 [Music] welcome to peep this out reviews with  Ian K stay frosty hey everyone welcome to the   channel where today I'm over at Taco Bell to check out  the return of a true fan favorite to their menu   for a limited time only and that's largely on part  to many of you guys and hey I'm included with you   guys too and I'll definitely get into that in just  a second but guys Feast your eyes on it it's the   return of the Enchirito it looks really really  tasty just like I remember from way back in the   day my first time going in on this looking nice  and cheesy let's break this one on down real quick   all right so what you're looking at here aside  from all the red sauce and cheese is a warm   flour tortilla that's filled with their seasoned  beef refried beans and onions and of course it's   topped off with cheddar cheese and red sauce so  a very simple ingredients list on this one and it   is definitely Saucy definitely cheesy and it looks  just like I remember like I said from back in the   day the Enchirito is back but only until November  30th so you better make sure you get yours   so with this being my first time going in on  this one officially I've never tried this before   let's see if the flavor is going to deliver on it  this is the returning Enchirito here at Taco Bell   let's peep out this flavor yes sir this pretty  much looks like the quintessential ingredients   list from Taco Bell minus the sour cream and  guacamole naturally on the rice but this is   everything else with the red sauce on top of it  and guys it's been a minute since I've had onions   on the inside of anything here at Taco Bell and  again the cheesy factor is off the chart with   this one here so like I was mentioning earlier  this actually won the fan vote in their app to   come back for a limited time only I think they  went up against like a double decker taco or   something along those lines and obviously  that was gonna lose because we've seen so   many different versions of that over the years  but the Enchirito is legendary it almost feels   like a little mini wet burrito actually but  it's very cheesy the way that it looks and   I've never had it so this is a first for me so  let me actually take a little bit of this here   and uh we'll get into this and wow that is very  cheesy actually Feast your eyes on it we got the   red sauce action plenty of the beefy action as  well too I think this is going to be a pretty   flavorful bite here we go my first time the  Enchirito here at Taco Bell let's peep this out oooo that red sauce is banging  the cheese the cheddar mmm   the season Beef from Taco Bell you already know  guys you already know the refried beans action   let me go for another one here we'll go for a  few bites in this actually this is very cheesy   look at that action very very nice very simple in  terms of the ingredients list on this like I said   but it is classic Taco Bell flavor with that red  sauce which is pretty good let's keep going in   mmm that's pretty tasty the refried beans are very  thick very dense and that red sauce has a little   bit of spice to it nothing crazy but I am very  much digging the flavor and it really is pretty   nice let's go for a couple more on this very tasty  very cheesy like I said with that warm tortilla   very simple to make pretty much throwing this in  the steamer after to melt the cheese very tasty   mmm they need to keep this on the  menu I don't know why this went away   so simple so flavorful a little crunch of  the onions in there as well too and guys   again gotta keep showing it to you  presentation is not too bad on this   and there is no shortage of the red sauce which is  really nice so a little quickie review on this one   very glad to finally give this a shot finally I  should say and I think I said that twice but it is   very very tasty so one more on this one we'll wrap  the review with the rating coming up next but it's   just like I expected with the regular Taco Bell  flavors but with that red sauce which is really   very nice with this very nice quality indeed so  one more bite and we'll wrap this one up hang on well as with all the other items here at Taco Bell  you can definitely dress this up with additional   things I'd recommend maybe a dollop of guacamole  some sour cream to take this one up a notch maybe   a few jalapenos but this is really a very tasty  item and it's really made even better with that   red sauce mixed in with the refried beans it's  very dense a little bit of the crunch from the   onions and that seasoned beef very nicely done  on this one guys well worth checking out once   again [Music] well I can finally say I've tried  the Enchirito here at Taco Bell I guess I can rest   easy now that I've got this in the playlist here  on the channel for Taco Bell very very tasty like   I said but keep in mind that's only good until  November 30th they really should keep it around   longer but maybe if the response is good they will  but officially November 30th and it's gone once   again all right so based upon my experience with  this one for the first time today I'm gonna have   to give the Enchirito here a Taco Bell a pretty  decent 8 out of 10 I was pretty much expecting   those classic Taco Bell flavors but the red sauce  I have to admit although it's a little on the   upside in terms of salt was very very flavorful  very tasty salt does equal flavor mix that in with   everything else on the inside of that you've got a  very tasty dish and again the refried beans action   along with the onions and nice little Duality  right there and of course plenty of cheese on   top pretty tasty guys but again I think most of  you guys know that if you're fans of it already   all right so do me a quick favor like always  drop some comments down below let me know if   you're going to be giving this one a shot and if  you do give it a go does it taste exactly like   you remember from back in the day drop those  comments down below and definitely let me know   and with that this is Ian K closing out  another high quality foodie feature for   you here on peep this out reviews
