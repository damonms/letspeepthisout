100% beef goodness is in effect for you right there now if you're wondering what the BFC is however I might have given that away right in the very beginning it's big fried cheese let's take a look underneath the bun here we've got what they're calling boom-boom sauce so that's definitely interesting I can't wait to see what that's gonna do but what you're seeing there golden fried goodness a nice cheese disc filled with mozzarella and cheddar guys and that's definitely gonna be an amazing situation it is thick almost as thick as the burger itself crispy golden brown just lift it up a little further you've got that 100% Angus beef goodness right there this is the third pound variant and I'm definitely diggin the way that that looks at its glistening very hot right now we've got some lettuce let me see if we can go a little bit further in looks like we've got a tomato slice in there as well and more of that boom-boom sauce very curious to see what this is about try not to steam up the lens for you guys but this is really the biggest draw I've seen yet in the cheese Department a fried disc of cheddar and mozzarella can't wait to get into that right now let's see if this one's gonna deliver the overall flavor it's the BFC Angus thick burger brand-new here at Carl's jr. let's peep out this flavor well let me just say I am very glad to be doing this one cheaters cam

burgers I have had over here at Carl's jr. since I've been doing reviews here no lie that is seriously awesome a little bit of a squirt of cheese in that one I kind of got the edge of that disc but I got to say guys the quality so far in the meatiness of it is absolutely there let's go for another bite and I'll definitely give you a close-up guys but so far very tasty and that cheese is beginning to squeeze right there check that out it's coming out the top let's go for this bite I'll give me that close-up but so far tasty mmm man all right the cheese drippage is in effect right now guys this is easily the most cheese I have had on a fast food burger I think ever look at the cheese that is on the inside of that beginning a drip down that's a serious situation right there and I got to say that combination of mozzarella one of my all-time favorites and cheddar goes extremely nice it's a little tart in the cheddar Department a little sharpness to it as well and the nice subtle flavor of the mozzarella cheese adding even more pull to this one is really really nice I love the overall flavor of it the boom-boom sauce a little on the sweet side it kind of looked like it was gonna be a little on the Tangier side but guys this is really a fried cheese showcase and I'm loving it with this new Angus beef this is pretty tasty you know the fact that this is actually 1/3 pound of Angus patty really says something to the overall thickness of the cheese disc that's hanging out on top of it guys it's almost the same thickness overall as the meat patty and I love the fact that it is completely loaded on the inside coated nice and crispy Brown as you guys saw but man it is just holding all the good stuff I can just squeeze that slightly and you can see that cheese coming out of there that is just a bomb situation you can get this one in a single in a double or the third pound so believe me I'm going with that third you want that meatiness to match up with the actual cheese itself the thickness is absolutely awesome let's go for another bite and definitely keep enjoying this one it's pretty bomb mmm that is so good the batter that's actually around the cheddar and mozzarella is actually not too thick and I'm liking that because it really lets that cheese melt very very nicely on the inside without being too bready but there's just an overabundance of it I'm just loving the look of this one it is just so delicious with the amount of cheese on this one here definitely big fried cheese for sure let's go for another bite with this one will definitely wrap this one up after the rating obviously but I'm so glad I'm doing this right now especially after hours it's a super fun super hearty let's keep going hmm hmm let's squeeze this one down just a little bit right there in the middle just to get a little bit more of this out guys but I am loving the amount of cheese on the inside of this it is super nice super juicy to go with that meat on top of it the oils of the cheddar the mozzarella in general and just the overall boom-boomness of it if I can call it that is pretty tasty that light tang that I'm getting from the sauce is a nice complement to the overall goodness you're gonna be enjoying with this one just a really dynamic burger in terms of the cheese Department and definitely one that's fun to check out absolutely tasty but admittedly a little on the messy side that's actually a good thing I'm so glad there's a burger diaper on the back of this one because the juiciness of that meat is coming through as well as the boom-boom sauce it's a little on the slippery side but that's a lovely situation and a very nice problem to have where the burger as juicy as that especially with all the cheese that it's got encased in that nice crispy golden goodness really awesome so with that said I'm gonna have to give the BFC the big fried cheese angus thick burger here at Carl's jr. a rock-solid 10 out of 10 guys there is really nothing wrong with that whatsoever it completely delivers on what it's advertising there is a lot of cheese a lot of cheddar a lot of mozzarella a very nice lightly sweetened sauce to go with it and overall a very juicy hotter type of Angus beef patty overall that combination works extremely well especially with the crispiness of the cheese being encased the way that it is that is just an awesome addition to that and something truly different I really haven't seen that much before right now so if you're a fan of cheese much less fried cheese and you love burgers which i think most of you guys do especially if you've made it this far into the review you owe it to yourself to give this one a shot drop some comments down below let me know if you're gonna be giving this one a shot after all is
