 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty so after the debacle that was the quote-unquote new and improved original pan pizza from Pizza Hut that I reviewed recently many of you wanted me to jump on over to Domino's because apparently they've got a pretty awesome version of it well I'm about to put that to the test so here we go with the Domino's version of pan pizza and I gotta say guys already after popping the top for the very first time on this box this looks really really tasty super fresh super melty I decided to go with the same three toppings that I actually got when I reviewed the Pizza Hut variant so we've got some ground beef we've got some mushrooms we've got some onions and there is plenty of cheese on this one and guys it's already looking very buttery and not dry like the other one take a look at that underneath right now this is actually looking really tasty I'm gonna lift this up as much as I can caramelized goodness on the edges right there guys looking really really tasty and I got to admit for the 12-inch medium that I got here on sale for $7.99 this is a pretty nice deal for what I'm looking at here right now looking really really tasty a decent amount of everything on here pretty even across the board let me see if I can try and split this just a little bit for you it is just a little wow it's very very hot let me lift this up just a little bit as you can see we have got some bready goodness and my fingers are already getting nice and buttery guys the smell is very rich in my car here right now let me get some of these slices separated we're definitely gonna get into this right now it's the handmade pan pizza here at Domino's we're definitely peeping out this flavor so are you a fan of high quality delicious looking food reviews well if so definitely hit that subscribe button down below and don't forget to tap that Bell icon so you could be notified as soon as new content drops every week now let's dive into this one well one thing that's standing out for me already with this one is the fact that there is cheese from edge to edge all the way to the very back of the crust so you can't even really see the crust unless you look at it head-on like this guys but man this smells and looks fantastic here we go it's the pan pizza from dominos please be good please oh oh my god holy sh** that is super buttery on the bottom I am definitely getting a much better vibe from this one already and I had a feeling it was going to just with that initial close-up beautiful flavor on this one the tartness of that tomato sauce is really making it difficult for me to talk at the moment here but guys delicious stuff fresh mushrooms you can tell they're not canned definitely the drier type but the flavor is good they're definitely freshly cut they feel like they are and of course the beef on top of it guys the crust is delicious let me keep going with this and I'll give you an even further breakdown I really want to get further into this right now mmm mmm well can you tell I was a little excited after that first bite that was a mouthful of detail for you guys you have a lot to look forward to with this if you haven't had this yet and I have to say the quality of the crust is really insane on this it's very doughy but just the light crispiness on the bottom and the butteriness is really sticking out very nicely toppings like I said earlier are very evenly distributed and there is plenty of cheese on this one can't wait to get into the caramelized goodness in the very back here let me just kind of rotate this for you looking very very good and again edge to edge cheese guys two layers of that goodness on this let's keep going so let's hit that caramelized buttery crusty goodness from the back real fast butter is rich on this that is so freakin delicious it's such a stark contrast compared to the version I tried from pizzahut recently this is really feeling like it's the real deal the quality is very high and again the butteriness of that crust on the very bottom is a beautiful situation all the caramelized edges at the very end of it are really adding to that overall feeling and the fact that you're getting cheese on edge to edge to this guy's from the middle to the end whatever slice you get it's coated and that's an amazing situation on top of the butteriness I'm gonna keep going you don't mind do you mmm I gotta keep going with it mmm my god that is so good mmm and hey while I'm knocking the slice off what'd you guys think of that box actually that this comes in that's a pretty cool-looking package I got to admit the marketing is pretty slick it's got all the detail on the very top there regarding the fact that it's handmade never frozen dough and of course you've got all the buttery goodness to go with they apparently just took three years to actually perfect so as they say on the box they didn't invent pan pizza they just set out to perfect it and I have to admit this is easily a highlight right now guys it is super close to perfection and the fact that it's right out of the oven super gooey super fresh super buttery I'm all over it as you can tell oh man one last bite let's hit it hmm alright so I'm gonna try and give you a 360 shot in all directions with this one just to give you as much detail as I possibly can and as you can see with that caramelized goodness in the back that is a major highlight when you get to it the butteriness is real throughout this one fresh toppings and I have to admit the seasoned ground beef is an amazing situation as we turn it over sideways here you can see there is plenty of cheese to go with just a beautiful situation and just so I don't drop this on my car yeah let's go the other way the butteriness is nice on this one guys it's just lightly crispy golden brown and I have to admit the quality again speaks for itself this is absolutely a treat to check out right now and definitely one of the best pan pizzas I've had especially from fast food pizza this is really delicious you know there's really nothing else to say about that one because I firmly believe I covered it all so with that said I'm gonna have to give the pan pizza from dominos this version that I got today definitely a 10 out of 10 guys there is nothing else I can see to improve upon this one except maybe adding a little bit more toppings the next time I get it the quality speaks for itself the crispiness speaks for itself and the butteriness was there it's not dry at all and just very very delicious all the way around so definitely give this one a shot if you haven't already and if you haven't given this one a try do you plan to drop some comments down below what did you think of this particular version of the pan pizza over here at Domino's based upon my review does this look like something you'd like to try drop those comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K
