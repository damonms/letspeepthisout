 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty what's going on everyone it's Ian K back again  with another high quality foodie feature for you   here on peep this out reviews this time returning  to mcdonald's once again to finish out my look at   the trifecta of their all-new mccafe bakery  items and as you can obviously tell by the   title guys it's the blueberry muffin and what a  blueberry muffin this appears to be in the size   department for $2.19 this is not bad and it's  looking pretty fresh what we've got here is a   very moist looking blueberry muffin made with a  special mix of enriched flour which is actually   a combination of wheat and malted barley and i  gotta say the combination looks really nice you   can kind of see the color contrast in there looks  like it's topped off with granular sugar on top of   it and naturally all throughout you're gonna find  some blueberries you can obviously see them on the   very top they're looking really great so let's not  waste any more time on this one it's the all-new   blueberry muffin as part of the mccafe bakery  here at mcdonald's let's peep out this flavor   yeah this definitely feels like a very moist and  dense blueberry muffin guys it's got some heft to   it i'm really digging the overall appearance it  looks really really fresh and it smells pretty   great also but take another close look at the top  of this here looks like that granular sugar action   is really prevalent on this one there and that's  with the blueberries you can see in the very top   really really nice and the thickness for  $2.19 very beautiful situation on this already   okay so before i get into this one and like  always if you guys are fans of high quality   delicious looking food reviews make sure to

want to crack this open in front of you first   so we can kind of get it going you guys can  see it is really really moist and wet feeling   look at that that is awesome plenty  of blueberry all throughout here and   i gotta say guys i am digging the appearance  of this this is gonna bode very well i already   know this is gonna be fantastic in the taste  department how could it not all right so let   me put this other half down here real quick  and man this looks great let's give it a go   guys it's the blueberry muffin part of the  mccafe bakery here at mcdonald's let's do it oh yeah oh all day long wow man i'm getting  like a panera bakery vibe with this one it is   ultra fresh guys and super soft  the granular sugar on the very top   and i gotta say the overall appearance of it is  really inviting already there i don't know if this   is actually streusel on the very top of it there  but it's got a little bit of something extra but i   gotta say overall the blueberry flavor is strong  the sugar flavor is not crazy but the overall   moistness of the actual muffin itself is amazing  let's keep going man this is really delicious so moist yeah and you're really going to be in for  that moistness as well and you can actually tell   as soon as you pick it up it feels very very dense  so even though i'm kind of getting like a light   airiness as i bite into it initially the denseness  begins to really pick up and it's very hearty and   again guys the quality is super fresh on this they  are really really doing it really right with this   and i have to admit the very top the granular  sugar at the very end of it over here as you're   crunching down with everything else is another  major highlight but just the moistness and the   overall denseness along with that blueberry  flavor which is all throughout is primo guys   super delicious all right so real quick before  i finish this last piece and give you that final   look at the other half before we wrap this one  up after the rating let me just tell you these   trio of desserts over here at mickey d's are not  playing around if you haven't seen the review   that i did on the cinnamon roll and the apple  fritter recently you should see those popping   up on your screen here right now you need to be  giving those a shot as well because as far as i'm   concerned it's truly a trifecta of goodness all  around you've got a little bit of something for   everyone but i got to admit i have a feeling this  one's going to fit pretty nicely into my routine   over here as the Fall rolls on getting one of the  copies of mickey d's because honestly guys as much   as i love the cinnamon roll especially the apple  fritter those were pretty awesome to check out   this is something that i think i can probably get  a little bit more often because it doesn't really   feel as heavy at least in the icing department  because this is really more of a dense piece of   cake so i'm really digging that i think that's  gonna go very well with the coffee itself but   hey that's just my preference your mileage  may vary alright let me finish this last   piece i'll give you a look at that other half  over there and we'll finish this one up after   the rating but guys super delicious on this  one i think you can tell right let's do it definitely baked perfectly without being dry at  all i mean you've heard all throughout the review   the moisture is off the chain with this one here  and it really shows the quality of what you're   getting into just by looking at what you're seeing  on the screen here how could you not want to bite   into this i mean it is so delicious and like  i said the sweetness and the blueberry flavor   is amazing definitely give this one a shot i'd  probably recommend starting off with this first   and work your way on up to the other two this  is really great and here i thought starting off   with the cinnamon roll was going to be the way  to go but considering my love of cinnamon rolls   in general that's the main reason that i wanted to  do that i probably shouldn't let the anticipation   build just a bit because had i started off  with this one right now it really would have   set the tone for the eventual quality that i was  gonna get to when i got to that cinnamon roll   with the apple fritter right in the middle which  was pretty amazing so guys a beautiful situation   on that absolutely so with that said i'm going to  have to give the blueberry muffin as part of the   all-new mccafe bakery items here at mcdonald's a  rock solid 10 out of 10 guys i got to be honest   this is probably one of the best fast food  muffins i think i have had in a very long time   and honestly i can't really remember the last  time i had a fast food muffin that was as moist   and as quality tasting as this was like i said  it's got like a panera vibe it really feels more   upscale and considering it's only $2.19 i'm not  sneezing at that at all considering the size   of it the denseness of it the overall sweetness  which wasn't crazy all the amazing flavors that   this one's delivering right now is off the chart  and guys did i tell you how moist this muffin was   to begin with all throughout this review i mean  it's crazy okay just a couple of quick questions   for you first are you a fan of blueberry muffins  i'm venturing to guess if you've made it this far   into the review you probably are but do me  a quick favor drop some comments down below   confirm that for me and secondly are you going to  be giving any of these mccafe bakery items a shot   drop some comments down below let me know what  you're going to start off with maybe the order   you're going to get them if you're going to  try all three i'm very curious to know what   you think is going to be your favorite drop those  comments down below and definitely let me know   and with that this is Ian K closing out another  high quality foodie feature for you here on   peep this
