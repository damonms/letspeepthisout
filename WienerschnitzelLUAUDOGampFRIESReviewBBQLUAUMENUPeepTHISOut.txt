 aloha and welcome to the channel everyone it's  Ian K where today i'm over at wienerschnitzel this   time to take a look at a couple of selections  off of their all new barbecue luau menu   that's right and you already know so stay  tuned because i've got both the luau dog   and the luau fries up next welcome to peep  this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty all right so i couldn't effectively get started  with this review without first getting lei'd up   for the occasion so to speak guys so now that  i'm fully dressed and ready to go let's get into   it feast your eyes on the new barbecue luau menu  over here at wienerschnitzel and as you're gonna   see back and forth here we got a very tasty  looking luau dog as well as some luau fries   and i gotta say guys the presentation is looking  very very loaded in the toppings department let's   break these on down for you real quick all right  so starting off with the luau dog what we've got   here is an all beef hot dog on the inside of  a steamed bun and on the very top all the luau   goodness barbecue luau sauce we have bacon chopped  bacon looking pretty nice i might add grilled   onions and pineapple and guys the presentation  is looking really really nice on this one   off to the side and also featuring all those  toppings are the luau fries and as you can see   a fairly decent portion of fries topped off with  the good stuff here and again luau barbecue sauce   we've got some pineapple grilled onions and  chopped bacon all over this guys and again the   presentation is looking pretty nice a nice little  combo of hawaiian themed action and i gotta say i   am totally digging the presentation of these two  so let's not waste any more time on these these   are both the luau dog and the luau fries here  at wienerschnitzel let's peep out this flavor   yes sir i'm totally digging the amount of  toppings on this one guys this is looking   really really nice supposedly having hints  of guava pineapple and sriracha in the sauce   for a little bit of sweet little bit of heat  let's give this a shot and just in case here   i'm doing this outside because it's super crispy  in southern cali right now i got my little tray   let's give this a shot it's the luau dog  here on peep this out reviews let's do it mmm pineapple that's different all beef goodness  nice flavor mmm that sauce is nice a little bit   of sweetness you expect that because of the  pineapple and actually the guava and the   sauce itself a little bit of sizzle nothing  crazy but i have to say i am totally digging   the smokiness of the bacon with this guys that  is a very nice combination of goodness so far   let's keep going in pineapple on a hot dog my  first time trying it like this is pretty nice mmm i like it look at a lot yeah that luau  barbecue sauce is not overpowering the flavor   of the beef itself and that's a beautiful thing  because it's a very even mix of flavors across   the board guys the grilled onions very nice  combination and of course that chopped pineapple   and naturally with that bacon on the very top  to add that smokiness to everything very nice   combination on this one this is pretty tasty yeah  i'm super glad i got lei'd up for this one so to   speak guys this is super fun to film outside  right now with the weather being what it is   and naturally having a hawaiian themed situation  for summer it works out pretty nicely let's go   for another couple of bites on this guys this  is pretty tasty for wienerschnitzel pretty nice mmm oh yeah i was really worried that the sauce  itself is going to be so much sweeter on top   of everything else and naturally with pineapple  on top of it it would be too sweet but guys like   i said it's a very nice even mix of the  goodness there and of course again you   can taste the quality of that dog pretty  nicely with this one very very tasty okay   i'm expecting the same flavors only on some carbs  this time take a look at the fry action with this   very lovely combination over here guys very very  nice let's go for a little of everything here   right on the very top oh wow there's a lot  of saucy goodness here take a look at this   plenty of those chopped onions right there  we've got some bacon bits in there as well too   the pineapple action and that sauce is  loaded let's give this a shot here we go   it's the luau fries from wienerschnitzel  let's peep this out mmm yeah you gotta get this on the side to go with  the dog that's really tasty mmm i almost like that   better than the dog itself believe it or not the  fries are nice and crispy and the combination of   the sweetness of that sauce goes beautifully with  this guys of course bacon you gotta love that   really really nice combo and again the hawaiian  theme pretty nice on this let's keep going in mmm wow pineapple with  fries who would have thought   and the sweetness of that sauce not  taking too much away from everything   nice even mix stealth yeah super fun promo  over here at wienerschnitzel with this one   and in fact you can actually get this also on  a burger they actually have that there as well   but if you're going to weinerschnitzel you got  to do the dogs you got to do the fries i don't   know about the burger situation it looked okay  but this is definitely where it's at least for   the side item over here the fries of course  you've got the goodness from the dog itself   but a nice combination of flavors with this  guys it really goes pretty nicely and again   pineapple and this type of barbecue sauce with  the sweetness really doing the do pretty nice all right so let's go for a one more bite of  this one here before we wrap the review up   with the ratings coming up next but guys very fun  on this one as i'm trying to grab everything here   of all the goodness here over wienerschnitzel  and again totally digging the flavor of the   sauce it's not overly strong and it really  lets you taste the flavors of everything   that it's on which is pretty nice so one  more bite and we'll close this one out hang on okay so whether you're going to wienerschnitzel  for one of their trademark dogs or of course   the fry action over here i got to say guys the  combination of these flavors work extremely well   a very nice combination of goodness on this and  i have to say again a very fun promo for summer   and it totally fits with some really even-keel  sweetness to go with everything that these are   topped with i am totally digging the grilled  onions and i definitely love the fact that the   smokiness of the bacon is really standing out but  it's not overpowering the quality of what it's   sitting on here so very very cool i'm totally  digging that definitely worth checking out if   you've got wienerschnitzel in the area barbecue  luau is here only at wienerschnitzel all right so   starting off with the luau dog over here at wienerschnitzel i'm gonna have to give that one a pretty   decent 8.5 out of 10 guys like i  said all throughout this review the quality of   those toppings really stand out above and beyond  everything else but not so much so that they're   drowning out the flavor of what they're sitting  on gotta say the quality of that hot dog was   really coming through pretty nicely as well and  everything was pretty even keel flavor-wise with   just a little bit of sizzle a little bit of heat  but the sweetness factor was really really nice   guys nothing over the top and again something very  fun for the season i'm totally digging that dog   it's pretty solid but on the reel when it comes  to the luau fries that one's gonna get an easy   9 out of 10 guys like i said all the quality  of those ingredients are really standing out   on top of some fairly crispy fries and they were  plentiful so naturally with a side item like that   that's something that you really have to get to  go along with whatever you get if you decide to   give the burger a shot do that but naturally  when it comes to this dog that is a beautiful   pairing and i'm glad that i checked out both of  these together nice crispiness of those fries   like i mentioned and again the quality of the  ingredients primo again a very nice addition   to the menu over here for the season all right so  do me a quick favor drop some comments down below   let me know what you thought
