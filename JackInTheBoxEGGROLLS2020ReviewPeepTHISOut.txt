gonna be coming back to that let's get into the egg rolls guys at jack-in-the-box let's do it mmm oh my god wait'll you see this mmm lots of diced pork celery a little bit of the carrots not really my favorite but the spices and that even this has actually got some Tang on its own mmm man let me get hold on oh yeah this is really really good stuff guys look on the inside of this it is loaded with diced pork very meaty situation very crispy situation and I am digging the authentic feel of this this is really really nice and as you can see again plenty of the loaded good stuff on the inside here this is really tasty hmm that is very hearty it really is alright so truth be known the egg rolls are definitely pretty world famous over here at jack-in-the-box but I don't think they're as popular as the tacos that they've got going over here so if you guys are curious about the look at those take a look at the review that I did not that long ago that was pretty tasty as well but honestly this is banging on its own guys these are really equal in terms of the flavor popularity like I said it's gonna be with those tacos but the egg rolls are pretty banging they are really good hmm man okay we got to go for a dip in the sweet and sour sauce here how could I not get the sweet and sour sauce you can get the other sauces here as well there's a lot of them but you got to keep it real keep it legit and do the sweet and sour so let's get into this right now obviously it's got that nice trademark orange tinge man the flavor of that pork is really coming through still right now this is really nice very very lovely situation let's do it oh man strong orange sweetness right there oh my god that is amazing I don't really know very many places that serve egg rolls like on the side like this but Jack you're definitely doing it right still after all these years this is a bangin situation so I'm gonna finish this one out with this last bite but one last final look at this one here lots of meat lots of the goodness on the inside the onions especially to those spices I'm loving the crunch the cabbage and of course that nice crispy outer coating guys that is a lovely situation lemme focus that just a bit really really nice and definitely crispy as you'd expect it to be right bangin all right so definitely a fun snack to check out and definitely fun to do on camera for you guys especially after all of these years nice quality on that overall and that sauce is perfect for it as you expect it to be the nice sweet tanginess of that orange is coming through and it dovetails nicely with everything that eggroll had to offer a bangin value too 3 for 4 bucks not bad considering how much meat was in that guy's lovely situation and I'm so glad that I got that instead of maybe like a one piece a three piece is the way to go so with that said I'm gonna have to give the world famous egg rolls here at jack-in-the-box a rock-solid 9 out of 10 and you know what it virtually is a 10 out of 10 and while it's not the ultimate egg roll that I've ever had for fast food it is the best egg roll that I've ever had because honestly the quality is pretty nice and it speaks for itself and I think you can see that here in the review but of course here comes the obvious question did this actually looked like it was worthy of your time right now drop some comments down below if you're
