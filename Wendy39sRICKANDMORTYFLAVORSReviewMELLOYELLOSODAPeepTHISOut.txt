 like tv from other dimensions has a somewhat  looser feel to it yeah it's got an almost   improvisational tone welcome to peep  this out reviews with ian k stay frosty what's going on everyone and welcome back to  another high quality foodie feature for you here   in the channel cheaters cam style after hours  over at wendy's a.k.a morty's to go into these   all new rick and morty mixes as part of their  coca-cola freestyle machines now available for   a limited time only so let's get into it starting  off on the left side we've got the mellow yellow   portal time lemon lime i definitely love the rhyme  with that that's pretty cool but as you can see   looking very nice lemon lime flavor of course  is on deck with this one it's got that green   neon color definitely looking very inviting for  sure and on the right side we've got the mellow   yellow berry jerryboree and i have a feeling  this is going to be a mixture of all different   types of fruity flavors here it's definitely  got that red tinge to it and i'm definitely   thinking it's going to be a little bit of  raspberry a little bit of strawberry maybe   maybe even a little bit of blueberry who knows  but it's definitely looking very inviting guys and   i have to admit i'm really digging the marketing  with this already this is pretty cool so let's not   waste any more time on these these are the all-new  rick and morty mixes over at wendy's a.k.a mortys   let's peep out this flavor alright so before you  start lighting up the comment section down below   asking me if this is how they serve these over  at wendy's i wish they did but actually no guys   i wanted to give you the best representation  of what these actually look like color wise   so i bought some clear cups and poured them in  as you can see and i'm very glad that i did guys   because the colors are very striking definitely  very cool let me put this one carefully down   i want to start off with that lemon lime action  i am definitely digging this already guys as you   can see it's got that artificial green neon  color but i am digging it very very slick   so here we go it's the portal time lemon  lime mellow yellow let's give this one a shot ultra sweet but wow strong lemon lime flavor  on this one i can only imagine how much sugar   is in this right now but guys super refreshing  and very very cool with the marketing mixed in   with this one i'm really digging the quality  very very nice let's keep going in pretty nice wow it's been a minute since i've had any type of  mellow yellow soda to be honest but i'm telling   you if anything was gonna get me to do it it's the  licensing of rick and morty to go in with this one   so i'm super glad that i'm getting rickety rickety  wrecked right now with the flavor that i really   wanted to start off with which is the lemon  lime naturally and i gotta say guys one of my   favorites no matter what variation of this that  i have very refreshing and very very nicely done that is really nice and just so you guys know  you can also get this in the zero version as   well which is like zero sugar naturally i'm  sure it's just as sweet but i figured let me   have some fun with this one go with the straight  sugar version of it and i gotta say guys again   very very nice the portal lime is pretty banging very very nice on this one all  right so let's put this one down   we'll get into the berry jerryboree and again  take a look at this one here a very nice red   tinge to everything here along with that it's  almost as striking into the straw as you can   see in terms of the color right there guys  let's give this one a shot look at him go hmm that's almost like a strawberry it's got a  little bit more artificial strawberry flavor to it   than anything else let's keep going in man just as sweet more strawberry than anything  else trying to see if i can kind of pick out maybe   some type of mixed berry or something like that  because it's supposed to be like a cornucopia   so to speak of all these flavors together it's  really more strawberry than anything else but   i'm really thinking hard enough on it possibly  some raspberry maybe a little bit of blueberry i'm   sure the flavor is trying to simulate a little bit  of everything but strawberry is really standing   out with this one but again very striking in color  and just like the previous one you can get a zero   variant as well so that way you can really cut  down on the sugar completely but i have to admit   very very nice in terms of the flavor of this one  i'm sure even the zero berry and i probably should   have gotten the zero just to try it but honestly  just with the regular sugar version it's very much   up there in terms of sweetness as you'd expect  it to be but the flavor is pretty nice but again   more strawberry than anything else that is  definitely nice let me take a quick little sip   of both of them really quick here because i really  want to give that a shot to do a quick mix here it doesn't really do too much i tried but  as you can see very striking presentation   i would definitely recommend if you get this over  at wendy's get some clear cups have some fun with   it especially if you're doing this at night this  is really very nicely done and again the colors   are really really cool guys they are really  really cool on this so just a little quickie   review to take a look at these two drinks right  now in terms of rating them i'm gonna start off   with the portal time lemon lime and give that one  a solid 8 out of 10 i think that one is more   than sufficient in terms of the score being a  little bit up there it's definitely way above   average in flavor the lemon lime definitely stands  out and the quality is pretty nice and of course   it matches i think the theme of what they're going  with there with the green with the portal and   everything as well i love the way it's striking in  terms of the color the flavor is good like i said   the sweetness is up there but just be prepared for  that and you should be because if you're getting   the regular variance of these in sugar form the  regular ones you know what to expect and as for   the berry jerryboree that one's gonna get just  an okay 7 out of 10 we'll take it maybe just   a notch below the 8 because honestly that one  is more of a strawberry drink than anything else   i'm not really getting a lot of different fruity  mixtures in that in terms of the flavor of course   naturally it's artificially put together but at  the same time i really would have liked maybe just   a little bit more variation in terms of just some  of the dimensions in the flavor with that as well   i think they were trying to go with maybe just  a little bit more with that one but it kind of   falls just a little flat still very refreshing  still very sweet but mostly strawberry but still   guys very delicious across the board for both of  them all right so fyi you've got until august 22nd   to enjoy these rick and morty mixes over here  at wendy's a.k.a morty's because that is actually   the season finale for season 5 of rick and  morty on adult swim naturally you have a lot to   look forward to with that so between now and then  definitely get your rick and morty mix on because   guys these are pretty tasty but just between you  and me go with that portal time lemon lime is the   first one to go with i'm telling you that one  is probably the better of the two just saying   and as we segue into the question from that last  statement are you gonna be giving this one a shot   drop some comments down below let me know if  you're gonna give these a go and if you've   tried them already which is your personal favorite  drop some comments down below and definitely let   me know and with that this is Ian K closing out  another high quality foodie feature for you here   on peep this out reviews cheaters cam style after  hours
