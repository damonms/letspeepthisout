 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty hey everyone it's Ian K for peep this out reviews back at it once again with another high-quality foodie feature for you at this time over at Arby's to go in on literally a fan favorite as part of their latest 2 for $6 promo that's right it's my first time checking this one out the Buffalo crispy chicken sandwich and I got to say the presentation is looking really really nice definitely diggin that star cut bun underneath it we've got the stars of the show starting off with that peppercorn ranch sauce action looking really really nice and that's all on top of that crispy chicken patty there guys it's a fairly decent size maybe a little on the thin side been looking nice and saucy underneath that looks like we've got the lettuce and more of that buffalo sauce this thing is drenched looking really really great so let's not waste any more time on this one I'm anxious to see if the flavor is gonna deliver it's the Buffalo crispy chicken sandwich part of the 2 for $6 here at Arby's let's peep out this flavor yeah I'm super glad to finally be checking out this Buffalo crispy chicken sandwich here at Arby's right now because out of all the Arby's reviews that I've done over the years and believe me I've done a bunch of them you can take a look at that playlist popping up on your screen right now for the evidence of that every so often I would get actually comments saying you know what you really should give the buffalo chicken a shot so I figured why not guys it's 2 for $6 right now how could I not take a look at this here another close up really fast for you a pretty decent sized chicken patty it's okay not super huge it actually looks like the bun is bigger than the chicken there but with that peppercorn ranch sauce action of course with the lettuce let's give it a shot and see how this is but right real quick before that first bite and like always if you guys are fans of high-quality

buffalo crispy chicken sandwich the full sandwich finally for me here on peep this out reviews at Arby's let's do it mmm-hmm yesir right away lots of buffalo sauce in that bite and you can tell with this little chicken diaper in the right back here it's catching all of it guys this is actually really really tasty a little on the salty side but man that's steamy type of heat it's pretty good give you another fast close up again a chicken patty like I feared it really is not too overly large it's decent but the quality of the breading is good and the flavorfulness is definitely there that buffalo sauce is pretty incredible the parmesan ranch the peppercorn goodness not quite into that just fully yet but the buffalo sauce is really really tasty on this one let's go for another bite tasty guys tasty tasty tasty definitely a little bit more of that peppercorn ranch goodness in that second bite and as you can see a very decent amount of breading on the chicken itself and the flavorfulness and the pungentness of that buffalo sauce is popping out pretty nicely it's actually really really good so while I do wish the chicken patty was just a little bit bigger overall the flavor on this one is absolutely delivering and I'm really really liking this overall combination and again I'm very happy that I've got this little chicken diaper in the very back to catch all that sauce not bad you know I had a feeling about knowing what to expect with this one and maybe that's part of the reason that I haven't reviewed this over the years I guess I actually did a version of this back in the day with ken domik from KBD productions take a look at that video popping up on your screen right now we actually took a look at the buffalo chicken slider back in the day when that came out so this is actually a larger version of that as expected and honestly the chicken is not that much bigger now that I'm looking at this here so 2 for $6 is good the value is decent for what you're getting but there seems to be a little bit of a compromise on the size of the chicken patty itself but not overly bad in terms of the value at all guys and the flavor is absolutely delivering on this one so just a solid combination overall of the tastiness that I knew from back then just in larger form but it is pretty tasty let's go for one more bite real fast hmm all right I lied I'm actually gonna get one more bite of this sandwich before we close this one out but before I do let me just say that 2 for $6 promo again is a pretty good value and considering they were leading with the chicken cheddar ranch not that long ago which was basically just two chicken tenders and some sauce and lettuce and tomato that type of thing was just okay with some cheddar cheese take a look at that review in the Arby's playlist card on your screen here but let me just say I'm really glad that we actually have a full featured chicken sandwich as part of that promo and I think they really needed to do that because two chicken tenders is okay getting a full patty adds a little bit more substance to the promo and naturally with the flavor being of what it is thankfully it's the Buffalo crispy variant because I've always wanted to try this like this and the fact that it's part of that promo just sweetens the deal even that much more so one more bite finally no lie this time and then we'll close this one out after the rating hang on well this one is definitely a disaster but in a very good way in terms of the sauce Department guys there's lots of sauce in the very back of this here and just to show you the back of this wrapper it is completely soaked so a nice value with this one and easily the one to get on the 2 for $6 fore sure it's pretty satisfying get two of these and I'm sure you're gonna be set especially if you like buffalo sauce so a very solid sandwich for sure and I'm glad I finally I just want to go so with that said I'm gonna have to give the buffalo crispy chicken sandwich finally reviewed on my channel a very solid 8.2 out of 10 I do wish the chicken patty itself was just a little bit larger but considering the value of what you're getting and exactly the type of quality that you're getting I'm not gonna hate on it too much it really was very very tasty and again very very very reminiscent to that buffalo chicken slider from back in the day definite recommendation easily all right so now the obvious question for you and this one's gonna be directed to all the buffalo crispy chicken sandwich fans of Arby's out there do you personally agree with my assessment of this one right now is it worthy of that rating should have been higher should it have been lower drop those comments down below and definitely let me know and with that
