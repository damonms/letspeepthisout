 yes sir it's the return of a true fast food icon  to the menu over here at KFC after nine plus years   that's right everyone the Double Down is finally  back on the menu for a limited time only and of   course I've got it for you here on the channel so  stay tuned because I'm Ian K and you're about to   peep this out welcome to peep this out reviews  with Ian K stay frosty you know right off the   break I gotta say this is a huge chicken sandwich  guys if you can even call it that because there   are no buns top to bottom on this one what is here  is chicken from top to bottom as you'd expect it   to be guys the classic double down a very lovely  situation indeed and I gotta say the crispiness is   on point aside from the size just look at the size  of this monstrosity a very lovely situation indeed   all right so what you're looking at here are two  double-breaded premium extra crispy all white meat   chicken breast fillets that are fried up to  a crispy golden brown and of course we've got   the 11 herbs and spices from the famous colonel  here in effect I very lovely situation they're   very huge let's pop one of them and take a look  on the inside and what you're going to see very   simply are two slices of hickory smoked bacon  a slice of cheese and a little bit of mayo in   there as well too guys but the combination of that  chicken I gotta say there is an overload of it and   it's a lovely situation indeed it looks really  fantastic nice and gooey with that cheese too   and since this is the classic version that  actually features that Mayo I actually have   a little bit of the signature spicy sauce on the  side so I definitely want to take a look and see   what that has to offer obviously I'm expecting  a little bit of Sizzle here but guys still the   combination of everything together with that bacon  and of course the cheese I have a feeling I'm in   for a very fun time reviewing this right now and  hey shout outs to my local KFC here in Pasadena   California for definitely packaging this one  up very nicely not only do you get the foil   package that their chicken sandwich is coming  to keep it nice and warm of course you get that   little chicken sandwich diaper in the back and I  gotta say again you really need that considering   what I've got here this is a very juicy very wet  situation I've got in my hands here right now and   it looks really really delicious so my first time  giving this a shot this literally came out about   a year after I started my channel I don't know  why I didn't do it back then but I'm glad I'm   finally doing it now here I gotta say guys very  excited so enough Chit Chat let's get down to it   literally it's the double down here at KFC here on  peep this out reviews let's peep this out shall we oh KFC goodness boy there it is man this thing is super gluttonous in the  KFC flavor with this just that first bite   alone lots of nice juicy white meat action on  the inside of that double breasted doubled   breaded crispy fillets I gotta say that is  a lovely situation a little bit of the bacon   that I got there a little bit of the cheese  but guys very simple ingredients list on this   but like I usually say sometimes that's all  you really need let's keep going in we're   definitely going to be getting into some spicy  sauce soon very tasty on this let's keep going mmm mmm wow well let me just start this shot off  by saying KFC why did you wait nine plus   years to bring this one back to the menu this is  seriously a delicious situation guys I mean it's   just the Classic KFC flavors with some hickory  smoked bacon a little bit of that cheese action   that's in there which admittedly is a little  bit more lost because of all the flavor of the   chicken which is fine I'm thinking it's there to  kind of hold everything together but even still   with that Mayo a very nice combination of those  seasonings with this extra breaded action right   now very delicious on this guys and again just  like I mentioned earlier a very sizable chicken   sandwich if you can even call it that since  there are no buns whatsoever on this guys so   I'm not missing the bread at all this is a very  nice lovely protein showcase and I gotta say very   tasty so far so glad I'm finally doing this now  all right I asked for a little bit of that spicy   sauce on the side because I wanted to give it a  shot so let me see if I can try and pour some of   this on here and naturally it's making its way on  down there we go got a nice little dollop of it   let's give this a shot you do have the option  of the classic version or the spicy variant I   figured since it's very little difference  in terms of the ingredients except for the   spicy sauce I'll just get it on the side and uh  we'll do it again for you but as you can see I   very lovely situation in there with that as well  so let's give it a shot the spicy variant of the   double down I can't believe I'm finally eating  this here on the channel this is a lot of fun ooo do the spicy wow that is  nice a little bit of heat   but that sauce is kicking the flavor up  big time and still a very lovely situation   with the amount of chicken on this look at  the size of this guys it is crazy in the   amount of protein that you get with this and the  combination of that bacon with that spicy sauce   that is a very lovely situation you know what  let's just keep it going shall we I'm gonna try   and dump a little bit more see if we can try and  get a little bit more action on the other side   there we go wow it's beginning to kick up just a  little bit I'm digging that let's keep going in mmm oh man you gotta do the spicy you gotta   yeah that nice Sizzle that I'm getting from that  signature spicy sauce is adding so much to the   overall flavors of the double breaded crispy  action on this guys I mean just the quality of   the chicken itself with this is really nice and  the size Factor alone is crazy off the chart   guys as you can see it's just a Showcase of what  KFC does really well over here with their chicken   and I have to say the combination of that  sauce along with the cheese and the bacon   everything with this is really shining through  just a nice experience giving this one a go   all right so for the last bite let me go for a  little bit more of that sauce because you knew   I'm going to right let me go for a little bit here  hopefully I can get a little bit extra there we   go it's beginning to kind of come on down I think  that'll do very nicely there we go that's the shot   right there let's give this a shot we'll wrap the  review with the rating coming up next but a very   pleasurable eating experience going into the super  large Double Down from my very first time here on   the channel hey my very first time period so let's  go for one more bite we'll wrap it up hang on mmm all right so the chicken sandwich diaper is  off the back of this one just for this final   shot here to show you guys I'm gonna try and do  this as carefully as possible as it's beginning   to fall all around me here but as you can see  a very lovely situation when it comes to the   size of the chicken very nice overall in terms of  the flavor but do make sure you've got plenty of   napkins on hand because you're gonna need it  if there's no chicken sandwich diaper you're   gonna be in a little bit of trouble with this one  but aside from that if you're a fan of the Double   Down from back in the day you have a lot to look  forward to with this one it is super flavorful so with that said I'm gonna have to give the  returning double down to the KFC menu my very   first time giving it a shot here on the channel  heck my very first time giving it a shot period   a rock solid 9 out of 10 guys just a beautiful  chicken sandwich eating experience if you can   even call it that considering there are no buns  whatsoever but still the quality of what I had   was very delicious very juicy very hearty very  large if there's one thing about it that I wish   they can change is the price point at $8.99 for  this it's definitely a premium but considering   the size I see where they're trying to work  with that there but at the same time it's a   little bit up there for a fast food sandwich  still super delicious definitely give it a go   with that signature spicy sauce that is  a beautiful situation in general I would   highly recommend giving this one a go with that  beautiful stuff all right so do me a quick favor   like always drop those comments down below let  me know what you thought of the look of the 2023   edition of The Returning double down here to KFC  did it look super delicious to you and once you   do give it a go does it taste exactly the same as  you remembered from maybe nine years ago if you've   tried it then drop those comments down below and  definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K  closing
