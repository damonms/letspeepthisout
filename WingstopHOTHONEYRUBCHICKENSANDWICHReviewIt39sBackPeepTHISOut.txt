 It's the Return of a fan favorite flavor over  here at Wingstop and of course I'm checking it   out on their very tasty chicken sandwich that's  right guys it's the hot honey rub chicken sandwich   and it's up next so stay tuned because I'm  Ian K and you're about to peep this out   welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian  K stay frosty yes sir I never get tired of   the chicken sandwiches over here at Wingstop  and I actually get them on occasion when I'm   not reviewing naturally guys it's that tasty I  do definitely dig them and with this particular   variation the hot honey rub I wanted to swing on  back and add it to the collection guys because   it looks really tasty and I know this flavor is  going to be off the chart and how can it really   not when it's sandwiched between a toasted potato  bun let's pop the top on this one and take a look   underneath and what you're going to see guys  initially is four nicely cut pickles and that's   all on top of a lightly breaded chicken filet  that's fried to a crispy golden brown before   it's tossed into some hot honey rub which is  basically sweet honey along with cayenne pepper   and ancho chili so that should definitely deliver  the fiery Goods but just in case things get a   little crazy of course we've got a side of ranch  to go in on and of course I'm going to be using   it with a sandwich very tasty indeed I'm sure and  again given how much I dig the chicken sandwiches   over here at Wingstop this looks to be a nice  addition to the collection here on the channel   so yeah crispiness on Deck with this one and I'm  definitely expecting the flavor to really be on   point guys considering the variation that I  checked out when it first came out when it   was on their thigh bites which I wish they would  bring back over here at Wingstop that's a pretty   lovely situation take a look at that review up  on your screen here right now I had a lot of fun   with that one so my hopes are pretty high for  this so without further Ado let's get into it   here we go it's the hot honey rub variation of the  chicken sandwich at Wingstop let's peep this out mmm come on now you knew this was  going to be good right the hot honey rub   is not so much a Sizzle as it is more of a steamy  situation so let me rinse this down really quick that definitely helps very lovely on this one guys   take a look on the inside a very nice piece of  white meat as they always are whenever I review   these chicken sandwiches and of course with the  hot honey rub the sweetness is definitely there a   little bit of the sizzle comes up there but again  it's not so much a Sizzle as it is steamy and I'm   really digging that so it's not overpowering the  flavor at all and you can taste everything pretty   beautifully let's go for another bite on this you  know we're getting into some ranch right hang on mmm pickles are banging you know I'm kind of  missing the fries this time out sometimes I   get the combo as well but just for the review  today I wanted to pick up the sandwich and just   to give you another look before that ranch action  take a look at the solid white meat guys it fits   this bun pretty nicely fried up beautifully the  light breading is really showcased nice on this   one glistening with the hot honey rub action  so the cayenne pepper the ancho chili that's   where the heat is coming from a little bit  of the sweetness I can see why this is a fan   favorite I'm so glad that it's back and I'm  finally trying it on their chicken sandwich   which I definitely dig in that as well too but  as most of you guys know I'm a huge fan of ranch   so of course this is definitely right up my alley  right let's go for a little bit of that action and   try and keep that focused we'll get a little  bit of that ranch in there well maybe a little   bit more than a little I'm not minding  it let's give this a go with the ranch man The Ranch at Wingstop is so banging so good  I just love how these chicken patties are Sauced   and tossed pretty nicely guys I mean all the  coating is definitely around this and when you   pair that up with the ranch the creamy the tart  the Tang everything about that is pretty amazing   so a lovely situation on this I'm so glad to add  this one to the collection very tasty I knew it   would be in handheld form naturally but Wingstop  if you're watching this please bring back the   thigh bites those are so awesome I really want to  see them back on your menu heck even the regular   thighs bring those back as well because that's a  lovely situation so I know the focus is on chicken   sandwiches right now but those thighs were so good  and I'd love to see them back so let's go for one   more bite we'll wrap the review with the rating  coming up next but guys a very lovely situation   on this one and you know what let's do another  pour shall we give you another money shot here   lots of that tasty Ranch action one more  bite the rating is coming up hang on so yeah the rest of the sandwich is not gonna  make its way home guys a very lovely situation   on this one even if the price point is up 50  cents now this is now $5.99 here in Southern   Cali when they used to be $5.49 but guys the flavor  is still pretty amazing the combination of those   pickles the acidity the snap in the crunch goes  amazing with the coating and of course with that   hot honey rub with the sweetness and the heat  a nice combination that balances everything   with the ranch definitely give this one a go all  right so with that said I'm gonna have to give the   returning hot honey rub on their chicken sandwich  here at Wing Stop a pretty Rock Solid   9 out of 10 guys just a beautiful flavor combination across  the board and again I can see why it's back on   the menu the combination of the ancho chili  the cayenne pepper and of course the honey   mixed together with the fried goodness of that  white meat a beautiful situation combined very   beautifully on top of that with a crunch snap and  acidity of the pickles and The Toasted potato bun   come on guys it's a winner all the way around  with that ranch especially mwah delicious stuff
