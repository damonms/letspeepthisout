 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty Panda Express is getting heated this summer with what could easily be the American Chinese version of Nashville hot chicken so let's go in on the all-new Sichuan hot chicken to see what it's working with an initial first impressions they're a little on the small side although the crispiness is absolutely on point what we've got here is a three piece order of antibiotic free white meat chicken that's fried up to a crispy golden-brown before being talked into a Sichuan peppercorn sauce and then topped off with a sprinkle of spices here guys so a little proprietary blend of goodness to add a little bit more heat to the situation but I'm really diggin the fact that the crispiness looks really really nice and it really is reminiscent of Nashville hot chicken just in the appearance they're looking really really tasty and the smell is definitely nice the aroma in my car is lighting up very nicely right now let's see what this one's all about in the flavor Department this is the all-new Sichuan hot chicken here at Panda Express let's peep out this flavor so are you a fan of high quality delicious looking food reviews well if so definitely hit that subscribe button down below and don't forget to tap that Bell icon so you could be notified as soon as new content drops every week now let's dive into these all right we got to do this one quick because it's literally over 90 plus degrees outside of my car right now which means on the inside even with the windows cracked like always it's just as hot if not hotter so let me grab one of these Sichuan hot chicken pieces here and give this a go guys my eyes are kind of stinging already from the aroma of this believe it or not I can smell this very nicely and my eyes are already beginning to slightly burn so I've got high hopes for this let's give it a shot and see mmm well it's a creeper heat but I'm not really getting anything crazy in terms of the level of was expecting considering how it's supposed to be hot chicken and I'm thinking Nashville hot chicken but it's just a light sizzle in the background it's kind of petering out believe it or not guys but the chicken is pretty decent well I have to say the Sichuan peppercorn sauce does combine pretty nicely with a very nice light outer crispy coating on the chicken itself but speaking of the chicken it's a little on the dry side there's no real moisture to speak of and while the heat itself is more of a creeper heat it is a nice overall flavor and I have to admit again the chunkiness is on point you know I don't know if it's that Nashville hot chicken vibe that's playing in my head right now but I'm getting a little shade of the KFC flavor of that chicken with this right now although minus the oiliness that that chicken had which I thought was pretty tasty the heat level though is not really there I really wouldn't call this hot chicken maybe like a sizzle type of chicken or something like that but the Sichuan peppercorn sauce there's not a lot on here it's a little bit on the drier side overall but the flavor is decent and again that heat it's a creeper still tasty though and with the white meat chicken itself being a little on the drier side which is usually the case like I said with white meat in general the flavor is absolutely on point you can really taste the quality of the chicken itself really nicely done so it's more sizzling than hot with a very decent amount of quality chicken on the inside although a little on the dry side and a nice light outer coating to go with and I really like the peppercorn sauce theme I think it actually fits pretty nicely with us and naturally with the theme at panda it completely suits guys but really really nicely done I would definitely recommend giving these a shot at least once but let me just state the obvious for you real fast if you're gonna give this one a shot definitely get it neither a bowl or a combo because getting it a la carte the way I did right now just to try it is completely not worth it $4.40 for 3 pieces of that and considering the size is small is pretty much your ripoff it really is so with that said and grading this one based upon flavor and appearance alone I'm gonna have to give the Sichuan hot chicken here at Panda Express just an OK 7 out of 10 if they were just a bit bigger and the heat was definitely hotter I would say they were absolutely spot-on with what they were advertising but as it stands there's small pieces of chicken with small heat to match so if they can turn up the heat level just a bit and go a little bit above fast food heat that people generally expect these would easily be worth it but for right now they're just OK but of course the obvious question is do you agree with my assessment of these drop some comments down below have you already had the Sichuan hot chicken over here at Panda Express and if you have did it really deliver the heat for you drop those comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K closing out another episode of peep this out bringing you brand-new content every single week here on my channel so
