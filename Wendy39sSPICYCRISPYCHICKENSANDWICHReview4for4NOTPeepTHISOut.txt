spicy what kind of sauce uh ranch and for the drink i'll do diet coke will that be all that's it $5.51 please great thanks so much no problem all right so we all know that wendy's is legendary when it comes to their chicken sandwiches so i've got some pretty high hopes for this one hey yeah how you doing all right awesome thank you all right sounds good stay frosty we'll see ya all right buh-bye here i am telling wendy's to stay frosty let's peep this out so here we go with the 4 for $4 here at wendy's or in my case the 4 for $5 and i gotta say this is actually not a bad deal even at five bucks guys this is actually looking really really good starting off in the very back we've got a small order of fries we've got four spicy nuggs right there and of course the buttermilk ranch to go with and a 16 ounce drink to go with that as well so not too bad focusing on the star of the show for this review here is the spicy crispy chicken sandwich and guys again a very lovely situation a fresh piece of leaf lettuce underneath this very soft bun we've got some light mayo action and underneath that 100% white meat a nice little crispy little patty right there this is not bad of course it's value sized but you can really see this is looking to deliver a little bit of heat here and i'm really hoping that it does overall breading looks a little light which is not bad at all and the uh ratio doesn't look bad in terms of the size to the bread and meat there so hopefully it's going to deliver on that one the thickness looks good underneath it absolutely nothing so very small little chicken sandwich supposed to deliver a decent amount of heat but it's part of the 4 for $4 or in my case 4 for $5 not a bad deal let's see if the flavor is going to deliver on this one and as you guys already know at nauseum it's the 4 for $4 4 for $5 here at wendy's let's peep out this flavor yeah definitely not a bad deal even at five bucks i mean four nuggs fries a drink and of course the chicken sandwich i gotta say guys not bad whatsoever and again you can actually see the spiciness of this one trying to come through in the breading a little pepper reaction right there looking pretty good so before i get into this one and like always if you guys are fans of high quality delicious looking food reviews make sure to hit that subscribe button down below and don't forget to tap that bell icon so you can be notified as soon as brand new content drops every week here we go with the spicy crispy chicken sandwich here at wendy's on a semi-crispy night here in southern cali right now let's do it well i'm not really getting any heat oh hang on well it looks like the heat's a little bit of a creeper on this one but it's really beginning to make itself known now that i've gotten through the thickness of the bread and as you guys can see the bun is taking up a lot of space on this one but as you can see on the inside just like i was saying during that initial close-up the bread to meat ratio on the chicken patty is not bad for a value-sized patty it feels like a premium situation here and i gotta admit i am really digging it not super juicy i wasn't expecting it to be but the breading is easily highlighting this one with a little bit of that spiciness and of course a little of the light mayo even though mayo's not really my thing it's really adding to the overall cool factor if i could say it that way to add to the overall flavor with this one in general so let's keep going with it mmm yeah definitely adding to the cool factor in terms of the overall flavor but to be honest this chicken patty really does feel like a stretched out spicy nugg and that's essentially what it is and again it's nothing earth shattering for what it is naturally but that leaf lettuce is a major highlight i really dig the fact that the leaf lettuce is high quality it's fresh and it's not shredded falling all over the place and naturally with the bun nice and soft in terms of that as well just overall a very nice chicken sandwich here at wendy's and i'm really glad it's delivering on their reputation for being one of the legendary peeps out there with quality chicken sandwiches and when you can get the actual promo for this one granted four bucks is what it should be it's not a bad deal whatsoever including the nuggs the fries and naturally the drink but of course you can go for other selections besides this one but this is the one i think you want to try because naturally it's the newest and overall the quality is pretty good let's go for one more bite yeah that heat is not bad it's more of a peppery type of heat that's really the only thing the actual flavor that i'm getting is more of the fried outer coating with a little bit of pepper and actually that white meat goodness on the inside so just to round this one out before the rating here guys not bad for what this is like i said the value is high for the promo if you can get it 4 for $4 that's pretty good but naturally even at five bucks not a bad value when you are getting a quality piece of chicken here at wendy's they definitely know how to do chicken right even in value form like this not bad whatsoever so with that said i'm gonna have to give the spicy crispy chicken sandwich here as part of the 4 for $4 wait for it 4 for $5 for me here in southern california here at wendy's just an okay 7 out of 10 it's really nothing earth-shattering like i said and the quality is decent it's definitely way above average for what it is and naturally as part of that promo it really rounds out a very decent price point even though it's a little elevated over here i know i'm harping this one to death but guys it is what it is but like i said the quality of the chicken is decent and even still at five bucks you can hate on it very solid all right so now the obvious question based upon my experience tonight if this one is five bucks out your way is it worth getting are you gonna personally give this one a shot drop some comments down below first and foremost are you a fan of the chicken sandwiches here at wendy's in general do you preach the gospel when it comes to the chicken over here and secondly how good is this value even at five bucks drop those comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K closing out another high quality foodie
