right guys let's peep this out it's meatcraft from the sea down the arby's way feast your eyes on the beer battered fish sandwich and guys this thing is really really huge i am really digging the size of that cod right there in the middle looking beautiful starting off with that brioche style bun right over here let's pop it and see what we've got underneath looks like we've got some tartar sauce and feast your eyes on how big that piece of cod is guys fried up to a crispy golden brown and it's beer battered with actual beer no alcohol of course but a very lovely situation because authenticity is key and that's definitely a cool selling point underneath it and again you can see look at the size of this fish it's huge we've got some tomato we've got some lettuce and underneath that peeking on the bottom is some pickles as you can see there and more of that tartar sauce this is looking and smelling really good and it's actually very very hot but guys let's not waste any more time on this one i can't wait to sink my teeth into it it's the all new beer battered fish sandwich here at arby's let's peep out this flavor all right so yeah like i said i'm not really a fan of fast food fish but as soon as i saw this one the look of it instantly grabbed me because guys the quality of that cod alone just the thickness of it looks well above what you'd expect to get from a fast food place guys just look at that with those pickles on the bottom it looks absolutely fantastic and thankfully we've got a fish sandwich diaper in the very back of this because of all the tartar sauces this has got this is completely littered on the bottom with the good stuff there so thankfully this is actually properly equipped okay so before i take the first bite and like always if you guys are fans of

week guys the non-alcoholic beer battered fish sandwich here at arby's let's do it oh first off that pickle snap along with the acidity and the crunch of them together along with the flakiness of that cod let me just show you real quick here guys this is nice and flaky nice and fresh look at that on the inside right there just a huge thick piece of goodness from the sea naturally on the inside of a brioche bun but of course all the crunchiness that goes with this one thankfully the tomato is kind of hanging out in the back and i'm cool with that you already know how i feel about tomatoes but guys i'm gonna keep going with this one i'm digging the fried tempura like outer coating this has got it's almost like a flash fry but the flakiness of that fish is banging this actually really feels like a high quality fish sandwich let's go for another bite man peep that out take a look at the flakiness on the inside now the tartar sauce let me just get into that real quick because it doesn't really feel like traditional tartar sauce it's not very thick almost like a miracle whipped type of sweetness that i'm getting with this one here but man it complements the outer coating of the fish beautifully and everything else on the inside of this so far is doing its job and thankfully no tomato just yet because the pickles right now are really making up for everything the sandwich has got going for it and it really doesn't have to because the fish itself is very flavorful on its own but i am really digging the inclusion of pickles on this believe it or not i think it adds just a whole textural vibe to it on top of what those pickles add anyway just a beautiful situation let's go for another bite i'm gonna go for another nice shot of actually this piece right over here let me show it to you i'm probably gonna get some pickle with this one here along with that tomato at the same time let's go for that one this is really really good i'm very satisfied so far with this sandwich fish is awesome and because of all the tartar sauce that they're using on the sandwich everything is kind of sliding into the very back of this little fish sandwich diaper here right now so that's actually a very good thing i actually did get a little bit of tomatoes in that one there i'm not really tasting it too much because of the nice vibrancy of the sauce itself like it's a little bit of sweetness it's kind of giving me a miracle-whip vibe but the overall flavor of the fish and guys again look at the very back of this here this is just a huge piece of fish and i gotta say again for the money this really doesn't feel like a fast food type of sandwich it's a huge piece of fish like i said and it's very very thick and thankfully the breading is not overtaking the actual flavorfulness and the size of the actual fish itself it really feels like a flaky type of cod it's really solid and the quality is just banging on this one here let's go for one more bite on this one before this last close-up i'm going to give you here right now and obviously we'll finish it up after the rating but guys a very very solid outing with this fish sandwich i'm so glad to have given this one a shot and thankfully i didn't listen to myself by not going in on fast food fish this time out here at arby's because guys this is another variation of chicken from the sea i know you're probably thinking tuna but i gotta admit this is banging this should actually be on the menu year round it really is tasty one more bite we'll finish it up after the rating and we'll close this one out let's do it all right so this one is super messy i can't spin this one around for you because the very back well actually you know what let me just show you what i'm looking at here right now look at the very back of this fish sandwich diaper guys it is loaded with the good stuff packed up ready to go and it really is a good call to actually have the sandwich have one of those because it really needs it but as you can see a very flaky situation on the cod and again the inclusion of those pickles absolutely love that on top of the nice quality of that brioche bun solid combination of everything all together and just a very solid fish sandwich it's definitely getting the job done very tasty man i may have to change my mode of thinking when it comes to fast food fish after this experience right now because that is a high water benchmark right there and i have a feeling the batter has something to do with that naturally it's not alcoholic it is beer battered but the quality is very solid the flakiness of the cod is amazing and overall like i said those pickles and the combination of that miracle whip style dressing i guess i can call a dressing because that's really kind of what it is wasn't really getting real tartar sauce flavor out of that but the flavor that it did deliver was absolutely there so overall i'm gonna have to give the beer battered fish sandwich here at arby's a rock solid 10 out of 10 just delivered really pretty much across the board with this one guys the flavor was off the chart and the thickness of that cod especially and the fact that it didn't really have a lot of breading on the outside even though it initially looked like it it was more of a flash fry tempura style i really love the quality of that because you can really taste the fish and that really is the big standout on top of the pickles naturally again i'll keep coming back to that because i love the crunch the snap the acidity and what it really added to the overall package just a solid sandwich overall and one i'd easily recommend for you especially if you love fish okay so now the obvious question are you going to be giving this one a shot are you a fan of fast food fish in general all those things that i'd love to know down in the comment section down below so drop those comments let me know what you thought of this one in particular based upon my review
