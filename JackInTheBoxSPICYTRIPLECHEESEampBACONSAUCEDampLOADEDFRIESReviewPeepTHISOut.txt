right so what  we've got here are the famous curly fries over   here at jack-in-the-box topped off with a white  cheese sauce that's actually made up of parmesan   and monterey jack so it's definitely a white  looking situation for sure there's also some   cheddar cheese in there as well also along with  it we've got some bacon pieces habanero ranch   which should add just a little bit more sizzle  and coolness along with jalapeno slices to keep   that heat train going guys but again this is  looking really awesome very decadent and the   aroma of those crispy fried fries are definitely  looking pretty awesome guys very very nice in the   presentation department let's not waste any more  time on this one so there you go it's the sauced   and loaded spicy triple cheese and bacon fries  here at jack-in-the-box let's peep out this flavor   yeah there's no way to front with this one  guys the aroma of cheese is very strong in   my car right now with the combination of parmesan  and a monterey jack and the cheddar you'd expect   that on top of the fried crispy goodness guys  this is looking pretty awesome let me try and   grab a little of everything here and lift this  up for you so you can see what i'm looking at   nice and cheesy nice and decadent the bacon  action i can kind of see some of the bits   let's give this a go one more time because  it's a mouthful of a title it's the sauced   and loaded spicy triple cheese and bacon  fries here at jack in the box let's hit it you knew this was gonna be good right oh very  nice oh a little bit of heat coming up there   you'd expect that too yeah the parmesan the  monterey jack and the cheddar is very pungent   very strong little light saltiness that i'm  getting from it but with the heat and that   habanero action as well this is very very decadent  guys look at this really nice i am totally digging   the amount of heat in this it's just the right  amount along with the flavor of the cheese and   the curly fries are always banging over here  at jack let's keep going in this is great so rich this is very gluttonous definitely cheat  day food for sure guys really good mmm wow i got   some nice heated ranchy goodness with that last  bite guys along with some of the hickory smoke   of the bacon along with those jalapeno slices  and the overall flavor of the cheese and the   fried crispy goodness from the curly fries very  decadent on this very very delicious and i gotta   say super fun to get into right now really good  you know they could have stopped literally at   the habanero ranch on this one and it would  have been just as fine in terms of the heat   but when you add the sliced jalapenos on this on  top not only does it visually look pretty awesome   but guys the flavor is banging on this and again  the parmesan goodness that i'm kind of getting   from this sauce here right now on  top of everything else is so amazing   let me just lift up a little bit more for  you i want you to take a closer look at this   look at that action if you're watching this after  hours right now please accept my humble apologies   this is just crazy delicious let's go for another  couple on this i really want to it's very cheesy man this is great yeah i've rarely been  disappointed with the sauced and loaded fries   over here at jack take a look at the playlist  jumping up on your screen right now for plenty   of other reviews from the past i have got plenty  of them all different variations of this including   the sauced and loaded tots more recently which  were pretty good but guys this the curly fries   are on point with this here let me go for  another quick one just to give you an idea   wow there's actually more jalapenos down below  here wow let's grab another one this is so   delish right now so delish but again very very  decadent and of course i can imagine this must   taste even better after hours but at the same time  i'm so glad that i'm doing this for you right now   super delicious on this all right let me spear one  of these jalapenos one more time because i kind of   lost it earlier but as you can see again they're  pretty thick pretty chunky guys i am totally   digging this right now let's go for one more bite  we'll wrap the review up with the rating coming up   next but guys another gluttonously awesome side  dish over here at jack in the box and again the   sauced and loaded action is always pretty tasty  triple the cheese you can't fade it along with   the jalapenos and that spicy habanero ranch pretty  bagging one more bite we'll close it out hang on   yeah this is a definite fun one to check out  guys i know it looks completely messy on your   screen here right now but at the same time it  is very delicious to get into i don't really   care what it looks like because the flavor is  amazing on it this is an easy recommendation   and for $3.50 you really can't hate on the portion  size either pretty nice order on ubereats   postmates and grubhub yeah and speaking on that  portion size real quick it's not bad for the money   guys and again the presentation is really what  sets it apart i totally love the takeout style   boxes that they come in and they feel nice and  hefty in the hand and they definitely showcase a   lot of the goodness the way they prepare it the  jalapenos just look fantastic on the very top   alright so with that said i'm gonna have to give  the sauced and loaded spicy triple cheese and   bacon fries again a mouthful of a title but then  again it was a mouthful of awesome deliciousness   a rock solid 9 out of 10 guys while this is  not going to break the mold over what they usually   offer here at jack-in-the-box i've had a lot of  these flavors before what this is actually coming   presentation-wise comes correct and when you  have that amount of sliced jalapenos on the top   along with three levels of the cheese the  parmesan the monterey jack and the cheddar   guys it's a banging situation truly delicious  stuff all right so do me a quick favor drop   some comments down below let me know if you've  actually already perused my jack-in-the-box   playlist and if you've
