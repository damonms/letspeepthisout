 what's going on everyone and welcome or  welcome back to the channel it's Ian K   where this afternoon i'm over at sonic  america's drive-in because it looks like   it's going to be three times the fun with their  latest promo that's right and honestly this one   is definitely looking right up my alley so stay  tuned because the big dill cheeseburger is up next   welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty so could this be a fast food pickle lover's  dream come true well guys we're about to find out   feast your eyes on the big dill cheeseburger here  at sonic america's drive-in and as you're going to   see we have got a lot of pickley saucy goodness to  get into with this one let's break this one down   real quick all right so right off the break it  looks like we've got a very nicely toasted brioche   bun situation here guys let's pop it and take a  look underneath and as you're going to see there   is no shortage of their dilly ranch sauce along  with some chopped lettuce looking pretty awesome   and as we pan down you're going to notice more  of that dilly ranch sauce along with crinkle   cut pickle slices and crispy pickle fries guys  actually made with dill pickles a very lovely   situation so the triple threat of pickle goodness  is all over this one and that's all sitting on top   of a 100% pure seasoned beef patty and i got to say  guys not bad in the overall presentation of that   as well there is a lot of crunchy goodness going  on with this one and i'm definitely digging it   already underneath it it looks like we've got  a slice of melted american cheese for color   and probably to help hold everything together  but guys looking very awesome and as you can   see on the inside of this one plenty of that dilly  ranch sauce again this is looking pretty awesome   so let's not waste any more time on  this one this is the all-new big dill   cheeseburger from sonic america's  drive-in let's peep out this flavor   oh yeah this is definitely right in my alley  guys i mean the crinkle cut pickle slices alone   along with that ranch sauce and of course some  dill mix in with that has got to be a beautiful   thing but when you mix in the crispy pickle fries  that is definitely the wild card i think on top   of everything else here all right enough chit  chat we're definitely getting down the business   here we go guys the big dill cheeseburger from  sonic america's drive-in let's peep this out wow they are not playing around guys that is  a hearty situation when it comes to the pickle   and ranch game on this one and of course that  beef patty i got everything in that bite and   i gotta say it is absolutely delicious plenty  of nice pickle flavor the dill action as well   and of course the juiciness and everything with  that beef patty on the bottom is a very beautiful   situation this is pretty banging already i had  a feeling it was gonna be let's keep going in mmm yup yup yup you're guaranteed to get some  awesome dill ranch flavor with this one guys   considering how much sauce is on this this is  really really beautiful and i have to say the   overall mouthfeel is awesome you get the acidity  the snap and the crunch of the regular pickles on   this and naturally the crispy goodness that's  mixed in with it for variation is a very nice   combination on top of that and of course with  that beef patty a lovely situation all encased   in a very beautifully toasted and soft brioche  bun this is definitely banging right now very   delicious and you know what i love the fact that  they're really focusing more on the pickle aspect   of this and you'd expect them to considering it's  the big dill cheeseburger right but when you have   three different variations of pickled goodness  on this one here you really want it to showcase   big time and it definitely does there's plenty  of each but what i'm already seeing and i wish   there was more of them are those crispy pickle  fries there's only about three or four on here   to kind of go lengthwise across the burger  itself there so it's layered pretty nicely   but i think a few more of those would have  gone a long way but guys this is really very   flavorful i love the fact that there's no tomato  on this one there's really nothing else you need   this really is a pickle showcase probably one  of the best burgers sonic has put out in a very   long time and coming from me that usually is a  hit or miss with them when i review them anyway   that's saying something this is pretty good  let's go for another couple of bites on this yeah that dilly ranch sauce is definitely banging  on this guys i mean it's got its own tartness and   creaminess there but when you combine that with  the pickle flavor everything is really really   super flavorful because of that again i only wish  there was a little bit more of those fried pickle   pieces on here but at the same time i am totally  digging what i got here and on top of the burger   patty itself even though it's a little on  the dry side as i'm getting further in here   there's so much moisture i'm not minding that at  all guys still a very very beautiful situation   the chopped lead is a little bit of a nuisance  on this one i would have loved to have had maybe a   single leaf of lettuce on this one here but even  still the showcase of all the pickled goodness is   more than making up for what i'm having here guys  this is really tasty so yeah very solid amount of   pickled goodness on this one guys i mean of course  starting off with the dilly ranch sauce that's   really the main thing on this of course the sliced  pickles right after that and the crispy pickle   fries just a lovely combination and a triple  threat of pickle goodness if you're this far into   the review watching me do this right now chances  are you're more than interested to give this one   a shot i would highly recommend it and like i  said coming from sonic this is actually a very   very cool very delicious across the board let's  go for one more bite we'll wrap the review up with   the rating coming up next but guys a very solid  outing over here at sonic and i gotta say with   all the pickle goodness again this is right up  my alley one more bite we'll close it out hang on you know i really hope this is the start  of a nice pickle trend in fast food because   honestly considering onion rings and  regular french fries mozzarella sticks   you never really see fried pickle chips  from a fast food spot and actually i would   love to see more of that action considering  sonic is really rocking with it right now   i am so glad that they're right out the gateway  that this is very well done and i have to say   overall not a bad value with a little over five  bucks for this it's a mouthful and it's very tasty   so with that said i'm gonna have to give the  all new big dill cheeseburger here at sonic an   awesome 9 out of 10 guys this was a beautiful  situation across the board with the exception of   the meat being a little on the dry side as i was  getting into it but like i said earlier this is   a showpiece for pickle goodness guys and that's  the main reason you want to give this one a go   the fact that it's on a piece of cheese i couldn't  really taste is not really a huge deal breaker for   me but considering all the other robust flavors  on this particular burger this is easily one of   my favorite ones over here at sonic and like i  said earlier with me also loving pickles and ranch   anyway of course this is gonna be pretty tasty  unless that wasn't made right there's really no   way that could have failed but guys very delicious  across the board and an easy recommendation to try   pretty nice all right so if you've made it even  further into my review right now chances are like   i said you're probably going to be giving this one  a go so do me a quick favor drop those comments   down below let me know what you thought of this  one in particular and what did you think of the   overall pickle flavor i mean was it strong enough  for you because it was pretty nice across the   board for me guys drop those comments down below  and definitely let me know and with that this is   Ian K closing out another high quality foodie  feature for you here on peep this out reviews   bringing you brand new content

with you i think you missed the  boat by not pairing this one up with that pickle   slushie i mean that was such a blast to check  out a while back how could you not bring that   back to combo it with
