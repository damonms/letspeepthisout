 what's going on everyone it's Ian K and welcome  or welcome back to the channel where today i'm   over at good old b-dubs because it looks  like they've got some brand new bird dawgs   on the menu now available for a limited  time only that's right and you already   know i'm taking a look at one of them so stay  tuned because the loaded bird dawg is up next   welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty yeah these definitely look pretty loaded to  me feast your eyes on him here we go with the   loaded bird dawg here at buffalo wild wings and as  you can see a very saucy situation in this little   combo pack here guys let's break this one on down  real fast all right so starting us off it looks   like we've got some fairly toasted brioche style  hot dog buns and on the inside is the main stars   of the show what we've got are hand breaded  chicken tenders that are topped in this case   with wild honey mustard grilled onions new belgian  flat tire beer cheese and some green onions to add   some additional color to garnish this one  out but as you can see guys not a bad size   in terms of what we've got here and they do come  in this cool little box which i'm really digging   off to the side and naturally rounding out this  combo is some of their natural cut fries and   in this case of course i went for some ranch  dressing absolutely but guys not a bad value   for what i've got here and it does look fairly  sizable considering the food in front of me   all right so let's not waste any more  time on this one these are the all new   loaded bird dawgs here at buffalo wild wings  let's peep out this flavor yes there's some   pretty cool presentation on this one guys  i'm totally digging the box this comes in   the whole see-through aspect of it very very  cool okay let me lift one of these up here   my first time giving this one a go a little bit  of a saucy situation on the bottom but again feast   your eyes on this one plenty of the grilled onion  action right there as well very curious about this   new belgian flat tire beer cheese though  that's some name brand goodness apparently   again this is looking really really nice on these  brioche style hot dog buns here we go guys it's   the loaded variation of these all new bird dawgs  here at buffalo wild wings let's peep this out mmm well right off the break that wild honey mustard  is definitely singing to me right now guys it is   elevated so the steaminess is absolutely there and  that's pretty much all i'm tasting at the moment   but guys pretty nice mouthfeel with the chicken  itself the crunchiness is pretty nice as well   but i am not tasting any of that beer cheese just  yet but still a very lovely situation and again   that wild honey mustard is a banging  thing on this let's keep going in okay got some cheese there not bad well i'm  definitely getting some flavor from that belgian   flat tire beer cheese guys it's a little bit  more of a milder type of cheddar flavor that i'm   getting with this one but again it's really being  overpowered by the wild honey mustard on this one   but i'm totally digging the overall presentation  in general and again with the juiciness of that   chicken tender right there the hand breaded goodness  you can really tell this is pretty quality not bad   all right let me take a quick break from  this one just to kind of cool down slightly   with a little bit of ranch action here  because my mouth is definitely buzzing   with the uh the flavor of that wild honey  mustard right here but still let me go   for a little bit of ranch it's probably being  blown out contrast wise because of the lighting   but let's just go for this i need to  kind of clear this down just a bit oh yeah instantly i'm so glad i got some ranch  it's beginning to calm everything down here but   guys a very lovely situation with the natural cut  fries over here at b-dubs as always really good   let's go for one more i kind of like these because  they have like the skin on them they're almost   kind of like wendy's fries but naturally with the  ranch action it really elevates the whole game   nice and the fact that it's kind of  crispy outside right now too on top of it   still guys i'm glad i got the ranch okay back  to this chicken very nice on this we're gonna   go for another couple of bites on this a very  lovely situation indeed let's keep going in grilled onions definitely makes this   yeah out of the three that they offer  on the menu right now with these bird   dawgs i definitely wanted to go into the loaded  variations strictly because of the grilled onion   aspect on top of the beer cheese naturally that  was one of the main deciding factors with this   but naturally you've got a buffalo and a honey  barbecue option to go in on as well and actually   during happy hour you can actually get a deal on  these they're pretty much like five bucks or so   between 3 and 6 pm so not a bad deal there  so really really good value overall and guys the   quality is pretty nice on this it's all about the  sauce with this particular one because like i said   that wild honey mustard is really blowing this  one up big time but still it is very flavorful   in general all right so the steamy action in my  mouth continues with this one guys as we wrap   the review up with the rating coming up next but  let me go for one more bite on this one before i   do that but guys again very nice quality on this  one and absolute bar food when it comes to buffalo   wild wings with the cheesy factory mixed in with  that wild honey mustard on top of everything   else here guys a very tasty option let's go  for one more bite and we'll close it out hang on well a little over $13 for this combo it's  definitely up there price wise but when you   break it on down you're essentially getting two  of these dogs so that's like ten dollars right   there if they're five dollars a piece along with  a side of fries so not bad overall guys and again   depending upon your version of these i think the  loaded variation is the better way to go because   with the grilled onions being a little bit more  of a premium this is definitely the way that i   think you should go not bad on this variation and  i gotta say again total bar food over here at b   dubs pretty nice buffalo wild wings so with that  said i'm gonna have to give the loaded version of   these bird dawgs over here at b-dubs a pretty solid  8.2 out of 10 guys at the core of this particular   one it's really pretty much just a chicken tender  on the inside of a brioche bun which is fine   and again with the sauces that it's got it's  fairly decent but that wild honey mustard really   overpowers the whole thing with a little bit of  light cheesy flavor at the same time i would have   liked just a little bit of an even mix or maybe  just a little bit more cheese on this but guys   the grilled onions are really what capped this one  pretty nicely and again the flavor is pretty solid   and like i said earlier and also throughout this  review guys it's total bar food over here at   b-dubs and that really deserves to be on the menu  a lot longer than the promo time just saying all   right so if you've got b-dubs in the area do me  a quick favor drop some comments down below let   me know if you're going to be giving this one a  shot and out of the three that are out there which   other ones are you most looking forward to trying  drop those comments down below and definitely let   me know and with that this is Ian K
