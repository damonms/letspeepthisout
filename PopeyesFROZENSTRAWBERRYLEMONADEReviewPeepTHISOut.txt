 hey everyone welcome back to another high quality  foodie feature for you here on the channel where   this time i'm over at popeyes to check out the  latest variation of their frozen lemonade this   time featuring strawberry and honestly i gotta  admit it's a long time coming guys this is gonna   be a quickie review but feast your eyes on the  frozen strawberry lemonade and i'm really digging   the size of what i've got here right now guys  this is looking really really awesome for $2.59   take a look at this cup here this is pretty  awesome looks like we've got bits of strawberry   swirled around inside premium minute maid  lemonade and i gotta say guys the frosty   goodness is looking really awesome on this  so let's not waste any more time on this one   guys i can't wait to get into it and like  i said it's a steamy day here in southern   cali let's give it a shot it's the all-new  frozen strawberry lemonade here at popeyes   feels so good going down wow nice and frosty guys  perfectly made i got to tell you guys as well there's a lot of tart icy goodness right now  it's getting me in the very back of the throat   here but man guys take a look at that it's a  little contrasty there it goes beginning to   focus in plenty of premium minute maid flavor  on this one guys really high quality goodness   and then you get the strawberry accents coming  up on the very bottom but guys a very frosty   situation we've got here right now i'm really  digging the fact that it's not like a syrup it's   actually pieces of strawberry that you can taste  in this and it really is pretty high quality i am   really digging this keep going in oh yeah really  really tasty and as tasty as this isn't as fun   as it is to actually have this with a straw i have  got the spork ready to go just in case because you   know what you really want to give it a shot like  this as well take a look at that nice icy frothy   goodness guys really tasty let's give it another  go mmm oh yeah that's actually the way to do it   besides the straw obviously maybe a little bit  more in there the strawberries a little bit   more towards the bottom you kind of mix this up  just a little bit well more lemonade goodness if   anything else but i'm loving the strawberry  accent at the very end of it pretty nice you know this is straight up taking me back to  when i did the frozen lemonade when the chicken   sandwich first came out over here at popeyes they  call it just a sweet cane frozen minute maid lemonade   or something along those lines i'll make sure to  have that review popping up on your screen right   now so you can take a look at it that was ultra  sweet goodness as well and the lemonade was really   awesome with that and naturally it's continuing  with this guys i am really digging the fact   that they're adding strawberry because it  feels more like a summertime drink this way   minute maid obviously is one of the kings in the  game when it comes to juice in general so for   lemonade especially you already know it's going  to be high quality premium goodness right away yeah that is awesome one more quick scoop of this  and i want to go for a little bit more of the   sippy sip action right there i'm really digging  how frothy and foamy this is it's really holding   its composure even though i'm in the shade here  right now this is really holding up pretty nicely   wow i'm beginning to get a brain  freeze already that is the sign of   a really good frozen drink guys couple  more sips on this very refreshing nice   and sweet i gotta say guys again  the quality you can really taste it man that strawberry on the bottom the  real deal i'm trying to swing this around   so you can see right there guys really nice  combination of the two and a classic pairing   between minute maid with their flavors here  this is really really good stuff and again nice   quality for like $2.59 for what this is the size is  pretty banging on it guys it really is considering   the recent slushies i did at mcdonald's it was  like two bucks and that was like kind of like   the most basic as you can get but the size was  very small so for $2.59 this is easily worth your   time the quality is very high and overall like  i said it's really going to satisfy on a very hot   day or even a semi-hot day this is just really  ultra refreshing guys really really good stuff   all right so just to round this one out with a  rating is if you really need me to rate this for   you because i think you know where i'm going  with it i'm going to have to give the frozen   strawberry lemonade here at popeye's a rock solid  10 out of 10 the value is high the flavor is high   the experience of having it is also pretty awesome  as well and guys like i said the premium quality   really stands out just a very delicious thirst  quenching drink although i got to admit it's   going to still make you kind of thirsty because  it's sweet but even still very very awesome   stuff over here at popeyes especially for the hot  days of summer that are obviously coming our way   all right so a couple of quick questions for  you because if you've made it this far into   the review i ventured a guess that you're a fan of  lemonade and strawberry together in a frosty drink   naturally there but are you personally going  to be giving this one a shot and if you are   aside from the combo of these two flavors  what are some of your favorite frozen drinks   drop some comments down below and definitely let  me know and with that this is Ian K closing out

real soon in the meantime stay frosty yeah i think  this one's pretty obvious i'm not gonna have too   much of a problem staying frosty especially with  something like this i mean aside from the size   of it guys pretty awesome stuff on the inside  of this cup alright everyone until next time   i'll talk to you soon hey thanks for checking  out another one of my reviews but just in case   you
