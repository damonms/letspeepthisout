here at Little Caesars let's peep out this flavor yeah this definitely looks and smells pretty awesome right now now first and foremost let me start this review off by simply saying look I know Little Caesars is considered a value brand but I gotta be honest you'd be hard-pressed to tell me this is a value type of pizza that I'm having right now I mean toasted parmesan Asiago you've got the pepperoni which is standard but fresh mozzarella and sweet basil this is gonna be a lovely situation I think alright so before I hopefully confirm that tastiness for you right now if you guys are fans

cheese on them that is a nice thick cut of fresh mozzarella this is no joke nice quality on this one and obviously with that toasted goodness in the back we're not quite there yet can't wait to give that a go but the pepperoni is amazing on it the quality is nice nice toastiness on the bottom right here this is just a very very lovely situation overall let's keep going with it and get into that crust but I'm digging this so far guys how could you not it looks pretty awesome doesn't it let's go mmm that thick cut mozzarella is awesome on this it really is awesome it's literally a nice bunched up portion of mozzarella with a little bit of that tomato sauce from Little Caesars and the sweet basil that I'm getting actually is really beginning to stand out it's leaving a little bit of like sizzleness in very back of my throat here right now but nice quality guys really nice quality on this one and before I go into the very back of this crust here let's go for another close up right there as you guys can see that pepperoni is a nice situation the sauce is kind of light which I'm really diggin because it really makes that cheese stand out and again like I said it's nice thick cut so let's check out this crust on the very back and take a look at this parmesan Asiago goodness right here it's nice and toasted as you can see looking really really nice let's go for a bite of that real fast it's like a nice breadstick nice pungentness from that Asiago is coming out and it's got some nice little notes of parmesan as you'd expect there but the Asiago pungentness is really what I'm getting more of that and of course the nice crispy crust on the very back here just a really really delicious pizza and real quick just so you guys know my boy Drew over at Drew's food reviews actually told me about this initially I'm gonna put a link down below to his review make sure you jump on over and show him some love over there he checked this pizza out a few days ago and I'm so glad that I'm doing this right now so Drew this one is for you baby let's go for another bite hmm man the oils of that pepperoni along with that sweet basil and of course that mozzarella a very lovely situation the light sauce that I'm getting from with a nice Tang from that as well and then guys because I'm towards the very back here I'm getting a little bit of blowback from the Asiago toasted Parmesan goodness there as well but just a delicious pizza and the value is decent for what you're getting with this one guys easy recommendation and again that highlight in the back is bomb this thing is made for dipping sauces I only wish I got something to try that with right now but a very nice combination of everything that you're seeing here straight out bangin on this pizza for sure but I got to be honest I was a little worried in the beginning on this one because the value of what I thought I was gonna get for the money wasn't gonna be there because naturally the extra most bestest you're gonna get a lot more pepperoni at least 50 slices I believe and a lot more cheese but what you're getting with this is the quality of the cheese that's really the main thing with this one on top of a nice Asiago toasted Parmesan goodness in the very back that's the selling point alone guys so even though technically you're getting less cheese less pepperoni overall for a little bit more money you're getting a little bit more of a banging type of pizza I would say maybe a lot more of a banging type of pizza to be honest in terms of the flavor that you're getting with that one and that sweet basil caps it off just a beautiful situation so with that mouthful of a summary I'm gonna have to give the pepperoni cheeser cheeser pizza here at Little Caesars a rock-solid 10 out of 10 this one ultimately delivered I got to tell you guys it was super hot and fresh from the oven super fast to pick up from the pizza portal and let me just say it's a lovely situation having this right now especially with the weather outside getting pretty cold so guys delicious pizza something you should definitely try but of course the question is are you gonna give this one a shot come on it's Little Caesars I have a feeling you're going to drop some comments down below have you actually had some type of pizza like this in the past and if you have how excited are you to give this one a shot drop
