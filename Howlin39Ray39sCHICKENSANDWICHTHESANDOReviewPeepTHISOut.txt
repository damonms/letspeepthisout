 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty hey everyone welcome back to another high quality  foodie feature for you here on the channel where   this time out i'm going in on the legendary  howlin rays because guess what they've got a   brand new location that just opened up in pasadena  and while you can only get it through postmates   at the moment that's a great thing because you  can absolutely get it delivered and it's finally   available that's the important thing so let's  go in on it guys feast your eyes on what they're   calling the sando and i gotta say i am blown away  by what i'm looking at here right now this is a   huge chicken sandwich what we've got here is one  of their butter buns and underneath it take a look   here guys we got plenty of thick cut pickles and a  heaping portion of their slaw and i gotta say guys   there's a lot of goodness here but take a look  at what it's sitting on again a huge piece of   boneless chicken breast and as for the heat level  as you can tell by the color of this one i opted   to go a little bit hotter than normal so this  is really just the medium but it's still looking   pretty hot but guys take a look at the very bottom  of it it looks like that bun is being obliterated   by all of the weight of everything else on top of  it and i gotta say i am very impressed with the   presentation on this one so let's get into this  one guys this is the sando over here at howlin  ray's let's peep out this flavor all right so  before i get into this and just in case i didn't   mention it during that initial close-up this has  got what's called comeback sauce on it as well   which looks like a variation of maybe thousand  island and something else and chances are it's   probably gonna be something else but the color  looks very similar but guys this is a momentous   occasion because i've always wanted to try howlin  rays i just couldn't get down to chinatown to   check it out the fact that i've got one local  right now a beautiful situation so take a look   at this one more time this is nuts the size of  the chicken on this is beautiful guys and as you   can see it is definitely spiced up with the good  stuff right there i'm really hoping i didn't bite   off more than i can chew i think i'm gonna have  trouble biting this period but look at that guys   a thick cut pickle action the slaw the comeback  sauce on there the butter bun and i gotta say   guys i am very very impressed by what i'm looking  at here right now lots of lettuce lots of slaw i   should say falling all over the place let's do  it it's the sando my first time trying it over   here at howlin rays where to begin let's go for  a big bite right over here at the top let's do it mmm whoa oh man that's insane wow that was  definitely the bite to start this one off   guys i got everything in that every single flavor  on this right now and while the heat is beginning   to elevate as i'm going it's definitely noticeable  and it's a beautiful type of heat the tenderness   the juiciness of the chicken itself is rock solid  it's almost like a flash fry piece of chicken   not heavily breaded at all the beautiful  situation with the slaw and the pickles   let me just show this to you guys it is  amazing and i am absolutely blown away   by what i'm looking at here right now this is  absolutely delicious guys you can really taste   a nice little tiny little bit of thousand that  i'm kind of getting from that comeback sauce   it's very similar but i got to admit guys it's  got a very unique flavor that mixes very well   with the acidity of those pickles believe it or  not it's a nice combination pickles really add   something to chicken sandwiches in general but  guys feast your eyes on that that is a beautiful   situation and a super thick piece of chicken and  a huge piece of chicken let's just keep going in   guys this is pretty amazing i'm so glad i'm doing  this okay enough talking more eating let's go man this is so worth it you better believe you  need a chicken sandwich diaper on the back of this   one there is no shortage of that slaw in here guys  and again i'm going to keep trying to show as much   of this as i can to you it's falling everywhere  but look at that it is absolutely beautiful   it almost feels like a killer food truck style  chicken sandwich and it blows away the other guys   instantly just a beautiful situation and that heat  level is amazing for me personally it's elevated   even though they classify it as medium i can only  imagine what the hot version is if you want just   a straight chicken sandwich with no heat they have  what's called country which is pretty much just by   itself i may try that i may not well scratch that  i will probably try it but still guys so beautiful   on this and i have to admit again that comeback  sauce let me try just a little bit of that quickly it almost feels like a little light thousand  island but it's really nothing to it there   maybe a little bit of mayo on its own it's just  okay but with the pickle juice that's mixing in   with it that's the combination that really blows  this one up a bit in a good way and then the heat   just a lovely situation let's keep going guys  i am so digging this right now it's delicious oh god this is so worth the wait you know i  actually got the wifey the country version   of the sandwich so i can't wait to hear what  she actually thinks of this but guys again   a very lovely situation just take a look at that  look at the height of the bun itself and the   very bottom is smashed completely it's a very  heavy piece of chicken and again everything is   just swinging flavor-wise here a super beautiful  situation with plenty of slaw falling everywhere   and here real quick before we go further in let  me show you their shake fries this is pretty much   a little side order for four bucks that i got  here and i wanted to kind of check these out   here but they seem kind of salty on my fingers  already here let's give this a shot real fast   mmm crispy crunchy right amount of salt why they  call them shake fries i don't know maybe because   they have a little bit of salt shaking onto them  but nice potato goodness guys take a look at that   not bad whatsoever nice crunch on them too  yeah they're pretty nice but that's not what   we came here for this is what we came here for  and again guys look at the bottom of this here   if you can kind of see this everything is  littered with the good stuff this is just   a huge chicken sandwich there's really no easy  way to eat this and i'm doing the best i can   for you my hands are completely lit up let's  just keep going in delicious stuff here we go it's messy in the best most possible way wow all  right so for the final shot i'm going to try and   do the best i can for you here with a 360 shot  as i'm losing slaw all over the place here i'm   gonna try and do this carefully oh man this is  not working but here we go guys take a look at   this in detail i'm gonna let it do what it has to  do because it's gonna happen if it's gonna happen   but look at the size of this chicken look at  the back of it it's got a crazy butt it is   absolutely awesome the flavor of this is insane  and i have to admit i am absolutely shocked   at the quality of what i've got here right now  this is well worth the premium and i got to say   guys well worth the time really really delicious  stuff and i'm losing my voice here as i go i'm   just so blown away by what this is if you guys got  a howlin rays in the area here in LA you need   to order this if you're a fan of it already you  already know this is the real deal delicious stuff all right so let's just get right to the score  because i think you know what it's going to be   so with everything you've seen and heard me talk  about during this review i'm going to have to give   this sando my first time trying it here at howlin  ray's a rock solid 10 out of 10 that's easily   probably the best chicken sandwich i've ever had  i got to be honest guys no lie that absolutely   satisfies the hype it delivered on all counts  the heat level was beautiful on it i was a little   worried about the medium but i got to admit even  though it's still kind of resonating with me it's   a comfortable type of heat so i can only imagine  what the burn baby burn hot version of it is gonna   be and i may have to try that at some point in the  future probably going to you'll see it here on the   channel but guys super delicious on that and from  somebody who's not really into coleslaw at all   have to admit i really like the combination of it  on there little light crispness that it's got as   well with a touch of sweetness but the creaminess  was awesome and again that comeback sauce while   it was just okay on that the combination of that  with the pickles a very beautiful situation guys   the bun overall everything with it i can't stop  talking about it this is easily an amazing chicken   sandwich and easily worth your time definitely  give this one a shot it is delicious all right   so now the all-important question if you've got  howlin ray's in the area or if it's deliverable   to you in the pasadena area being that they're  open here now are you going to be giving this one   a shot drop some comments down below let me know  how excited you are to give howlin ray's a go if   you've never had it before and if you're already  a fan where do you think it personally ranks in   terms
