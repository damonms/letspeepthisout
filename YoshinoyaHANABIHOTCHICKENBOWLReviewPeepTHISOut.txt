 what's going on everyone and welcome or welcome  back to the channel it's Ian K where today i'm   over at yoshinoya this time to go in on the other  version of their all-new hanabi hot menu now   available for a limited time only that's right and  this time it's all about the hanabi hot chicken   bowl so stay tuned because it's up next welcome  to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty yes sir this is definitely looking a bit  threatening to me right now with a very   deep red crimson color guys feast your eyes on  this one here we go with the hanabi hot chicken   bowl at yoshinoya and as you can see they're not  playing around with the presentation on this one   it's looking pretty awesome let's break this  one on down real quick all right so right off   the break what i've got here is a nice base of  brown rice guys you can actually go for white   rice as expected along with udon noodles but i'm  always a fan of brown rice so i went with that   and topping it off is the loveliness that you see  in front of you some grilled chicken glazed with   that hanabi hot sauce guys a very nice combination  of goodness there and the heat i know is going to   deliver on this one also on the side we've got a  nice portion of veggies consisting of some cabbage   some broccoli some cauliflower and carrots and it  really gives a nice little color duality to this   one on top of the hot sauce which is looking  really nice on top of that grilled chicken   so you've got the complete trifecta the looks  the aroma and the heat that this one's going   to deliver so let's not waste any more time on  this one guys this is the all new hanabi hot   chicken bowl here at yoshinoya let's peep out this  flavor yes sir and as that hot sauce is glistening   in the sunlight right now almost like lightning  strikes i already know this is going to deliver   some crazy amount of heat guys because i did  check out the previous version of this one not   that long ago which you're probably seeing  jumping up on your screen here right now   that hanabi hot gyudon beef bowl was a bomb  situation so i had to come on back to give the   chicken a shot because that is a different  protein and i'm curious to see what that's   going to do to the overall flavor aside from  the veggie aspect of this again so one more time   take a look at that a nice lovely situation i just  love the presentation of this one let me go for a   little bit of chicken here and actually what i'm  going to do is grab some broccoli to go with and   a little bit of that brown rice action here  because i already know what to expect from   this heat-wise let's just get it over with  here we go guys it's the all-new hanabi hot   chicken bowl here at yoshinoya please go a little  easy on me compared to the last time here we go chicken's good and there goes the heat whoa  that is crazy hot but it is so fun to go in on it's so sharp right up in the  face first thing with that   it really lets you know that hey i'm  here right now really really nice so   let's go for a little more of this take a  look at that one more time man glutton for a   punishment it's kind of crispy here in southern  cali of course why do i do these reviews during   the day i need to be doing them at night back  to the normal cheaters cam coming soon hang on it's so good and so hot man don't get me wrong  it's pleasurable but it's a blast to go in on let me give myself one more quick minute here guys  the back of my throat is lit up right now but as   you can see this is the reason why that hanabi hot  sauce has got to be some of the hottest hot sauce   i've ever had over here at yoshinoya let alone any  fast food spot it is very very strong but i have   to admit as strong as it is it's still keeping  the flavor of the food intact so you can taste   everything nicely but that initial upfront burn  is really strong i'm definitely digging it though   and you know i do have to say i didn't  have veggies the first time out with the   beef version of this i like the fact that it  comes with the chicken and it goes very nicely   with the actual veggies and that brown  rice that hot sauce is a nice combo   really adds some additional flavor on  top of the sizzle let's keep going in cabbage and broccoli is good  but quickly heated too hang on i can't even chase it with plain brown rice strong wow really nice all right let's get to the  chicken real fast here again because i want   you to see a nice shot cross-section of the  grilled chicken action nice solid white meat   on this guys this is really really nice  and this one is probably the biggest in   the bowl coated very nicely let's go  for another couple of bites on this good chicken breast it really  is but wow crazy hot again i am enjoying this and again i have a feeling i  knew what i was getting into considering the first   time around with the beef so if you're going to  ask me if i like the beef compared to the chicken   if i like the beef better maybe i actually do  but the chicken is a different type of protein   naturally it's a little bit thicker and heartier  and i like that because guys i mean it really   fills it out pretty nicely and it is getting me  full even after just those few bites that i've   taken so far but with the veggies and the brown  rice i'm digging it let's go for another one it's a nice bowl it really is but man that  heat is creeping up once again hang on it is just so random initially i'm getting the  burn and then i think it's subsides and then as   i'm going further in it starts coming up again  really quickly i don't know when it's going to   happen but that's kind of the fun thing about this  so i'm liking this bowl guys it's fun to do even   on a crispy day here in southern cali let's go for  one more bite on this one i'm going to wrap the   review up with the rating coming up next because i  already feel my voice is beginning to go i'm gonna   go for one more with a little bit of everything  here let's get a little bit of the cabbage   actually here too just to go with that very nice  little bit of rice a little bit of cauliflower and   the hot sauce to go with the chicken here  one more bite and we'll close it out hang on hearty well you can never have too many close-ups  of this guys because that sauce looks amazing   in the sunlight i am totally digging the  quality of this one and again if you like   heat like i mentioned in the last review you  are definitely going to be down with this   because it is really pretty awesome if you've  got yoshinoya in the area it's worth checking   this out it's definitely solid in terms of the  heat and the overall flavor depending upon your   version of protein this chicken is pretty nice  well it looks like i'm going to have to match   up the rating with the last version that i just  did because guys it's the exact same thing just   with chicken and the chicken was very juicy very  tender and overall a banging situation in general   so with that said i'm going to have to give the  all-new hanabi hot chicken bowl here at yoshinoya   the obvious 10 out of 10 guys a pretty nice value  on that because you're getting a decent portion of   veggies on top of the chicken and i have to say  the heat definitely delivers this really is a   firecracker when it comes to heat and i'm loving  that because not only does it have plenty of that   naturally it's also got the flavor to match and  it doesn't negate the flavors as you get further   in even though there's a lot of upfront heat in  the beginning and then it kind of comes back here   and there throughout just a nice combination and  again a very nice version of the chicken bowls   over here at yoshinoya with that sauce definitely  something worth checking out all right so now out   of both reviews that i've done with the hanabi  hot goodness over here at yoshinoya do me a   quick favor drop some comments down below which  version do you
