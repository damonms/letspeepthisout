 what's going on everyone and welcome back  to another high quality foodie feature for   you here on the channel where this time i'm  over at denny's to check out one of their   all-new la favorites and being that i've  never had a burrito from denny's like ever   i'm actually going to be going in on the cali  chicken burrito so stay tuned because it's up next   welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty so here we go with the la favorites cali  chicken burrito here at denny's and i gotta   say guys initial first impressions i'm a little  underwhelmed with the size of the burrito itself   i mean i've got plenty of chips here for sure  but the size of that burrito is already suspect   so let's break this one down what you're looking  at here is a grilled flour tortilla that's filled   with seasoned chicken breast fresh avocado  cheddar cheese normally pico de gallo and ranch   dressing but guys the quantities of each of  these is looking a little on the light side   and as you can see this looks very very  small for the price point of $9.99 overall   so yeah definitely no bueno this burrito does not  feel hefty at all and considering it's supposed   to be a cali chicken burrito i was expecting  something a little bit more substantial in   my hands but what are you gonna do right it is  what it is off to the side and filling out this   container is plenty of their house-made chips  here and as you can see there's a decent amount   of them for sure and for dipping we're gonna go  in on some queso dip so this is looking pretty   good already i can't wait to do that but guys  again coming back to the burrito definitely no   bueno situation in the size department but let's  see if the flavor is going to deliver on it this   is the la favorites cali chicken burrito  here at denny's let's peep out this flavor   yeah man definitely not feeling the size on this  one and while i do like the size of the chicken   breast pieces in this for sure they do feel like  they're kind of filling out the little half that   i have here this was already pre-cut i'm really  not feeling the overall size for the price point   but again what are you gonna do like i said it is  what it is so let's just hope the flavor delivers   on this one here we go with the la favorites  cali chicken burrito here at denny's let's do it well i mean the flavor so far after that first  bite is not bad the ranch with the chicken of   course is a beautiful situation and the fact that  it's grilled chicken on top of it as well you can   really taste the nice flavor of the ranch with it  and of course the creaminess of the avocado not   bad i just wish it was a little bit more heftier  in my hand i mean this really feels like a small   burrito guys almost feels kind of like a taco  bell type of burrito it's that type of thinness   and even though it's kind of chunky the way that  it looks here right now not enough on the inside   overall but the flavor so far is doing a pretty  nice job here not too bad in that department you   know i'm almost thinking i probably should have  asked to keep the pico de gallo on the inside of   this burrito because then maybe it would have  filled it out just a little bit more probably   not that much but even still it would have added  overall to it there but even still like i said   guys not too bad for what i've got here and that's  strictly in the flavor department and speaking of   flavor really fast before we go any further let me  grab a little bit of the queso action for you as   you can see this is looking pretty good hopefully  that's gonna focus in there you go okay so action   with chips how bad could this really be house  made so naturally these are super fresh right now   nice and hot let's go for a little dunk it's  nice and creamy as you can see it looks like   we've got a little bit of pepper action in there  as well let's try this with the queso real fast oh yeah elevated saltiness on this but man  that queso is smooth i want to say monterey   jack cheese is in this but man the peppers  on this wow that's actually pretty nice   i'm gonna have to go for a little dip with the  burrito action here guys but this is actually a   very nice add-on lovely situation this is a  highlight right now oh yeah and because i just   mentioned it let's not wait any further on that  let's go for a little dip with this quote-unquote   mini burrito almost like a chimichanga without the  fried action right there hopefully you guys are   seeing that that's keeping the focus but lovely  situation with that queso let's try it with this that's a ticket right there  saltiness with the avocado   oh yeah and the ranch is beginning to  pick up a little bit that's actually nice   you know it's funny minus the avocado this  is pretty much any standard generic type of   chicken burrito that you can get but when you  add avocado everything becomes cali apparently   i guess they associate california with avo  but as you can see let's go for another dunk   in here another lovely situation of goodness  that queso is awesome light heat light spicing   that i'm getting from it but the cheesiness is  banging with it there and again it's got that   saltiness it's really elevated nicely and again  the ranch is coming in with it let's keep going in man this is the ticket it really is   and just to chase that last bite real fast  let's go for another chip kind of feel like   i'm doing more of a queso show for you right now  but guys this is a major highlight it's actually   almost better than the burrito that i'm having  it's really really tasty i'm pretty surprised really garden and again that combination of  the avo along with this queso and a little bit   more flavor that i'm getting from the cheddar  cheese here let me keep that in there as well   too there along with that chicken it's really  a nice combination this should really be on the   inside of this burrito if you ask me that's  really what they should have done with this   absolutely so yeah guys not too much else to say  about this one right now the disappointment is   real in terms of the price point and the  size of the burrito itself i mean i know   you're doing takeout and it's typically more of  an expensive cost because it's denny's anyway   pricing is generally kind of average but i got  to admit with these quote unquote la favorites   i'm really hoping this is going to be just  a little bit more substantial in the hands   to be more like a cali burrito something that  you can really wrap both of your hands around   but as you can see what we've got here is a very  similar taco bell type of situation to be honest   with some really good queso on the side i'm glad  i got that because that's what's really going   to help us along but on its own this is just okay  $9.99 definitely not worth the price point for that   definitely not well this was my first and probably  only burrito that i'm ever gonna get over here at   denny's unless they advertise something that's  actually in the picture with somebody holding   two hands to hold it something substantial that's  really worthy of the la favorites name at least a   cali chicken burrito something a little bit bigger  needs to happen with this and for $9.99 you think   it would have so with that said i'm gonna have to  give the la favorite cali chicken burrito here at   denny's just an okay 7 out of 10 and that's  really helped along because of the queso situation   on its own it's just above average aside from  the price point in the size the flavor actually   does deliver pretty decent i have to admit it's  solid the quality of the avo is pretty good you   can definitely taste the creaminess it's fresh  but like i said once you add the queso into the   mix that needs to be a standard ingredient on  the inside of this one and they need to lower   the price point by like maybe three bucks then it  would be worth it just saying all right so i've   got one basic question for you if you've been to  denny's most recently if you've ordered from them   direct have you actually seen these on the menu  in your area i'm very curious to know if this is   available across the country and not just here in  southern california drop those comments down below   and definitely let me know and with that this  is Ian K closing out another high quality foodie   feature for you here on peep this out reviews  bringing you brand new content every single week   here on my channel so while you stay tuned for that  next review coming real soon in the meantime stay   frosty yeah i sure do love the slick packaging  this one comes in denny's but let's try and fill   it out more with the actual entree that's supposed  to be in it not necessarily the chips on the side   i mean there's a lot of chips in here come on  alright guys until next time i'll talk to you soon   hey thanks for checking out another one of  my
