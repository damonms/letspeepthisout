 what's going on everyone and welcome or welcome  back to the channel it's Ian K where today i've   ordered up good ol mr beast because it looks  like he's teaming up with the big green guy   for a fun new promo and no it's not the hulk  that's right it's jolly ol shrek so stay tuned   because shrek's quesadilla is up next welcome  to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty all right now i think this is definitely going  to be something shrek would absolutely approve   of and considering his name is on this guys i  think he already has feast your eyes on shrek's   quesadilla this is looking really really awesome  guys i'm definitely digging the folds on this one   and it looks to be packed with the good stuff  let's break this one down this is looking awesome   all right so what we've got here is a very crispy  oversized spinach tortilla and on the inside   you're going to see this is folded over with all  the good stuff guys starting off with plenty of   diced white onions pickles and caramelized onions  and plenty of american cheese guys that is an   awesome situation already and underneath that  you're going to see the main star of the show   aside from that two smashed beef patties that are  house seasoned to perfection and as you can see   more of the cheesy goodness guys i am totally  digging the way this one is constructed   and i gotta say it is really set off  beautifully with this crispy spinach   tortilla it's looking really awesome and you can  tell this was made with some tender loving care   all right so let's not waste any more time on  this one i definitely want to sink my teeth   into this this is the all-new shrek's quesadilla  from mr beast burger let's peep out this flavor   you know and here i thought they were actually  going to pack all of the ingredients just on   the inside of this folded tortilla but as you  can see they layered it beautifully guys you   can see everything here and i got to say the  simulation of the green goodness here for shrek   is very much on point just look at how crispy  this looks really really nice and it is very   thick and very hardy considering $10.49 for  this this is looking to be worth it already   let's go for that first bite guys here we go it's  shrek's quesadilla from mr beast burger let's do it oh oh game over whoa right off the break super  dense super meaty super cheesy and of course   the crispiness with that tortilla really sets this  one off guys look at how thick this is right now i   didn't even really get into the pickles just yet  but there is plenty of caramelized onion action   and the cheesy goodness is on point i am  totally digging the experience already   this is a very hefty double cheeseburger  let's keep going in guys pretty tasty mmm pickle oh yeah oh man there is so many onions on  this totally digging that the crunchy cold snap of   those pickles goes amazing with the onions on the  very top guys and of course they are layered with   that gooey cheese and as you can see there is no  shortage of the onion action on this one and on   the very bottom those two smashed patties nicely  seasoned and i gotta say guys nicely meaty on   top of it but really what's setting this one off  and again the major showpiece here is of course   shrek's goodness on the outside the spinach crispy  tortilla is very very nice guys very nice indeed   this is a lot of fun to go in on you know i've  done a few of the items over from mr beast burger and   i got to say this is hands down my favorite right  now not just aside from the presentation because   this is looking pretty awesome but just the  overall ingredients list of what this has i mean   there's really no other way to really improve this  aside from maybe adding some bacon to the mix but   still guys super delicious on this one let's go  for another couple of bites this is pretty awesome it's just so thick it's pretty awesome yeah  definitely pretty awesome on this and if you're   kind of tiptoeing into the alternative beef type  of situation you can actually get the impossible   version of this as well for like three dollars  more it's about $13.49 it's a little bit of a   premium still but guys just again the thickness  is just on point with this and the flavor of the   cheese there is no shortage of it whatsoever  and of course with all the onion action on   this here let me just peel this back just so  you can kind of see some more of it i'm losing   pickles it is really really nicely done guys  nicely done indeed just super delicious on this   so yeah guys definitely a beast of a burger pun  definitely intended on this one because again it   really really is very thick but the appearance of  it and the whole marketing gimmick with this one   is very well done dreamworks definitely shout outs  to you this is really pretty fun and again a very   nice promo with shrek's name attached to so very  awesome all right so let's go for one more bite   on this one before we wrap the review up with the  rating coming up next but guys a super fun promo   and i gotta say again the presentation really  is what sells this one but not only that it's   all that good stuff on the inside so many onions  so many excellent flavors with this and again the   package is done very well it's layered beautifully  one more right and we'll close it out hang well are you on of seeing the inside of this one  because i'm definitely not as you can see again   lots of layered deliciousness with this  one guys a very fun promo and again   plenty of onions and cheese to go with but  of course again one last time a beautiful   situation with that spinach crispy action on  the outside this tortilla is awesome and it's   layered beautifully the way it's constructed  with everything together all in these bites   very nicely done the shrek's quesadilla is  definitely worth checking out just for the novelty   alone very very cool just open up your favorite  delivery apps and search mr beast burger so with   that said i'm going to have to give this limited  time only shrek's quesadilla for mr beast burger   an obvious 10 out of 10 guys there's really  nothing wrong with that it was made super fresh   all the ingredients were off the chart and i got  to say the quality and the overall appearance of   everything together was super fun to go into the  price point's a little up there but what you're   paying for essentially is the name and of course  the marketing to go with and guys speaking of the   marketing the packaging is pretty banging on this  as you're seeing on the screen here right now i   love the way it comes packaged with the box and  the sticker and of course you've got that mr beast   bag to go with as well just an overall bang-up  presentation and a quality burger on top of it   well worth the money in my opinion and super fun  to check out it was a blast to try this one today   all right so i've got just one simple and obvious  question for you guys are you personally going to   be giving this one a shot drop some comments down  below and if you have given this a go what did you   personally think was it just as crispy for you as  it was for me and was the presentation on point   drop those comments down below and definitely  let me know and with that this is Ian K   closing out another high quality foodie feature  for you here on peep this out reviews bringing   you brand new content every single week here  on my channel so while you stay tuned for that   next review coming real soon in the meantime stay  frosty yes sir some pretty fun marketing with   this one but i can't help but wonder if maybe  we'll see something with marvel in the near   future because guys they already have the green  packaging with this one why don't we actually do   a beast hulk burger that would be pretty awesome  maybe with like four patties mr beast i think you   need to get in touch with marvel just saying all  right guys until next time i'll talk to you soon hey thanks for checking out another one of  my reviews but just in case you didn't see   the one before this one you can find  it right up over here along with what   i think youtube's going to recommend for you  to check out as well as always i think you'll   find something like in both of them and i'll  definitely catch you in the next one see ya
