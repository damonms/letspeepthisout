 it's a comfort food classic done the handheld  way thanks to the folks over at Fatburger with   their latest promo and I gotta say guys this is  looking and smelling fantastic already so stay   tuned because I've got their all new chicken  and waffle sandwich up next I'm Ian K and   you're about to peep this out [Music] welcome to  peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty   you know right off the break I gotta say the  execution of this chicken and waffle sandwich   here at Fatburger is really done pretty nicely  guys I have to say again it looks really really   great and you can really smell that fried crispy  goodness very nicely on this one all right so   very simply what we've got here is some toasted  name brand Eggo waffles and on the inside you're   gonna see the stars of the show a hand breaded  crispy chicken filet that's topped off with a   whole bunch of bacon and of course some syrup to  go with because guys this is waffles you gotta   have some syrup action right I mean guys that's  expected but I gotta say again the presentation   is looking nice and crispy on this and let me just  give a quick shout out over to Fatburger because   they supplied me with a very nice chicken and  waffle sandwich diaper and you really need that   because considering this doesn't necessarily  come with syrup right away you actually have   to pour it on yourself I actually went a little  heavy-handed with this one so I'm glad I've got   some protection for the fingers but again you're  gonna see this all throughout the review it's   looking really really nice so without further Ado  let's see if the flavor is going to deliver on   this one this is the all new chicken and waffle  sandwich from Fatburger let's peep this out mmm crispy and crunchy oh yeah we're right off the top the name brand egg  waffles really stand out with this one right   away and immediately right into the chicken  which believe it or not I thought it was going   to be a little bit over fried considering  the appearance of it there but it's fairly   juicy and of course the syrup action is a  pretty lovely situation here I didn't get   any bacon just yet but this is a very fun  hybrid sandwich to eat guys and I gotta say   I'm digging the experience already let's keep  going in let me get some of this bacon hang on mmm there we go wow it's good there we go a little  bit of everything in that second bite and I have   to say with the rain beginning to come down here  in Southern Cali this is a very nice comfort food   classic to eat and sandwich form like this guys  very very tasty the combination of that mapley   type of syrup that I'm getting with this one is  beautiful the hickory smoked bacon is nice and   the Fairly juicy white meat chicken fillet  that you're seeing there although initially   I thought it was going to be overly fried it's  very tender and I gotta say it goes nicely with   these waffles nice combination and since I've  got some extra syrup on the side let's go for   another couple of bites on this one by putting  a little bit on here and I think that's just   a little bit more than a little but hey it's all  good it's gluttonous it's beginning to rain right   now in Southern Cali let's go for another  couple of bites I'm digging this right now whoa oh yeah I'm totally digging the sweet and  savory aspect of this one guys I mean I   thought the chicken like I said was going to  be overly fried and it looks like it's over   fried as you probably seeing up on the screen  here right now but it's tender it's juicy the   combination of the smokiness of the bacon the  sweetness of the syrup and a little bit of the   sweetness from the Eggo waffles believe it or  not it's going a long way so very delicious on   this one and I guess the fact that I'm kind of  having it on a rainy day right now is adding to   the experience so let's go for one more bite we'll  wrap the review with the rating coming up next I'm   gonna go for a little bit more of this syrup and  it's never a little because it really comes out   pretty quick here let's give this a shot we'll  wrap the review with the rating coming up next   very tasty guys it's definitely worth checking  out if you've got fat burger in the area and not   bad for $8.99 it's a sizable chicken sandwich  one more biting we'll finish it out hang on leggo my eggo for sure with this one guys this  is all mine right now a very delicious version   of chicken and waffles and handheld form and I  gotta say the combination of all those flavors   work extremely well like I usually say Simplicity  is usually the best way to go with some of these   ingredients you don't need very much and this one  delivers very distinctly in all those categories   sweet Savory a little bit of saltiness from  the chicken but overall very nice with the   hickory smoked bacon this one is easily worth  your time if you've got fat burger in the area   so with that said I'm gonna have to give  the all-new chicken and waffle sandwich   here at Fatburger an awesome 9 out of 10  guys like I said Simplicity is the way to go   with this one the combination of those flavors  work extremely well I love the crispiness of   the actual Eggo waffles themselves you can feel  their toasted on top of the actual crispiness of   the chicken itself on top of that and then you  get the hickory smoked bacon and of course the   sweetness of the syrup which you can add as  you go and I'd recommend doing that because   a little goes a long way with that obviously I  was a little heavy-handed with my pours but it   works extremely well and I gotta say again easily  worth your time to check this one out pretty tasty   all right so do me a quick favor like always drop  those comments down below first and foremost let   me know if you're a fan of chicken and waffles  because I'd venture to guess if you're this   far into the review most likely you are and how  excited are
