 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty what's going on everyone and welcome back to  another high quality foodie feature for you   here on the channel where this time over a good  old bk because it looks like their famous bacon   king is getting a little bit of an upgrade and  let's just say it's smelling a little pungent   that's right you already know what it is feast  your eyes on their all-new garlic and bacon   king and i gotta say guys again the pungentness is  real with this one let's pop the top of the sesame   seeded bun and take a look underneath and as you  can see there's the culprit lots of crispy garlic   pieces guys they're looking pretty fantastic  and there's a plentiful amount of them along   with some mayo for sure and guys take a look down  below there's even more garlic pieces there is no   shortage of the garlic goodness with this one  already i'm definitely digging that and that's   for the rest of the goods here and hence its  name it looks like we've got two full strips of   bacon on this one and naturally two whopper beef  patties about a half pound of beef before cooking   guys and naturally it's seasoned with a little  salt and pepper lots of flame grilled goodness   for sure and you can't have a bacon king without  cheese so let's split it and take a look and see   if we can get some cheese pull and obviously nice  cheesy goodness for sure with nothing on the very   bottom but not that you really need it guys it's  all pretty much front loaded and all throughout   this is looking pretty tasty all right so let's  get into this one to see if this garlic is gonna   deliver this is the all-new garlic and bacon king  here at bk let's peep out this flavor yesir you   can fade the bacon king over here at bk and it  looks like all we've really got here is a swap   out of the ketchup for these garlic pieces but  even still guys i gotta say it looks really really   tasty and it looks like it's gonna be crunchy at  that as well very lovely presentation with this   one and like i said earlier this thing is smelling  very pungent lots of garlic aroma in the car right   now all right so let's hit it it's the all new  garlic and bacon king here at bk let's do it crunchy bacon and crunchy garlic pieces yesir  right off the break there's an overabundance of   garlic flavor with this and that's a beautiful  situation because i love garlic personally and   naturally with the crispy goodness to go with guys  i'm almost getting kind of like a potato chip feel   with this which i really like and then naturally  it dovetails right into the flame grilled beef   and naturally with the cheese and the bacon and  just the overall goodness that it delivers this   is very very tasty and as you can see it's pretty  loaded with the good stuff here guys it really is   you know in prepping for this review a couple of  weeks ago i got to tell you i was really pretty   much on the fence with how this was going to  kind of go i mean i figured it was pretty much   going to be the standard bacon king and it is but  naturally the inclusion of those crispy garlic   chips guys i have to say they add a nice little  dimension and just so you guys know here these   are actually pretty cool i mean they're pretty  thick and they kind of remind me of like lay's   chips just a little bit here but they are very  strong and very pungent super flavorful as well crispy goodness for sure i  mean they're fried but wow   really strong actually that one  chip alone that's pretty nice   and given how pungent they really are i'm kind  of seeing why it's drowning out any flavor   of the mayo that's actually on this right now  let's keep going in guys this is pretty tasty mmm very hearty you know i think what i'm digging  the most about this aside from just the flame   grilled flavor of the beef itself like always over  here at bk with these king burgers is the flavor   of the bacon with those crispy garlic pieces  that's a nice combination and honestly i'm glad   it's not like a garlic aioli this really does  feel kind of different even though like i said   it's just a basic swap out of the ketchup for the  garlic pieces it's still the same bacon king guys   the dimension and flavor is definitely different  and it's crunchy and it's not just the crispiness   of the bacon it's all around and truly it does  make this one feel a little bit different on top   of being pungent like i said guys this is pretty  strong in the aroma department let's keep going in well here's an even better cross-section  shot for you all the layers are on display   for you right now and as you can see a decent  amount of those crispy garlic pieces for sure   and of course the two whopper patties  showing off their goodness as well   the cheese is actually on point on top of  everything else it really is the standard   bacon king but i gotta say it's the inclusion of  those crispy garlic pieces as a major highlight   to this one as it should be considering it's  the first word in the title of this thing   really tasty you know it feels like forever and  a day since we've had a new king burger over here   at bk and i have to say i'm so glad that this  is actually out right now nothing against the   ch'king actually it's a really tasty chicken  sandwich especially the spicy variant this is   a nice change of pace and i'm glad to finally  say that naturally because honestly it's what bk   does very well with the topping of those crispy  garlic pieces guys added to the mix the bacon   king definitely has a nice little pungent upgrade  with this one and it's a banging one at that all   right so let's go for one more bite of this one  we'll rate this one out and then we'll close out   the review but guys a very lovely situation  with the king burger over here for the most   recent version of it i should say and like i said  again this thing is freaking pungent let's go in well it's been a while since we've been around  the world with one of the king burgers here at   bks let's do just that as carefully as i can  given all of the crispy garlic pieces on this   one guys as you can see lots of flame grilled  goodness on this one the bacon is definitely   on point the cheese is on point that combination  always works but when you add in the bacon along   with those crispy garlic pieces you have a very  nice pungent upgrade to a classic over here and   guys again i'm not missing the fact that this  has no ketchup on it those garlic pieces are   more than making up for the flavor really really  nice so with that said i'm gonna have to give the   all new garlic and bacon king over here at bk  a pretty solid 8.5 out of 10 guys   this is just different enough to really feel like  it truly is just that different and it adds a very   nice pungent flavor overall with that garlic and  i gotta say again the combination of that with the   bacon is a beautiful situation the flame grilled  goodness of the beef the cheese all the stuff that   you already know and love from the bacon king  is definitely heightened with the garlic pieces   just a nice combination and it kind of makes  you wonder why didn't they do this sooner i'm   glad it's here now it's pretty awesome okay so now  that we've got a new king burger over here at bk   are you going
