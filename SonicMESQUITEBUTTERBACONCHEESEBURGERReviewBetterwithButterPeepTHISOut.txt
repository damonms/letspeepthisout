 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty well here we go with another high quality foodie  feature for you here on the channel where this   time i'm back on over at sonic america's drive-in  to check out what looks to be a tasty little   upgrade to their classic bacon cheeseburger so  without further ado let's get into it it's the   mesquite butter bacon cheeseburger and guys this  actually presents pretty nicely i have to admit   this is definitely feeling stacked definitely  feeling substantial and i'm really hoping the   flavor is going to deliver on this one so starting  off with what's supposed to be a toasted brioche   bun admittedly this looks like their regular  burger buns but let's just pop it and take a   look underneath and it looks like we're beginning  with a little bit of shredded lettuce some grilled   onions a very decent amount of pickles i have to  admit i'm liking that already and if you look in   the back of it there it looks like we've got a  little bit of barbecue sauce which is actually   a honey barbecue sauce and as we pan down you  can see the other major players of this burger   starting off with a fairly decent amount of  crispy looking bacon but admittedly it looks   a little on the charred side and that's mixed  in with some more of that honey barbecue sauce   it's all sitting on top of a quarter pound of beef  as you can see here guys supposedly seared in a   smoky mesquite barbecue butter and that's what's  adding to the overall wetness of this burger guys   but not bad there and as you can see nothing  on the bottom except a soaked bottom of the bun   actually there so very lovely situation and i'm  only saying lovely situation without tasting it   just yet because as you can see this is a  very wet burger the bottom of this bun is   soaked right now so it's already satisfying  in that department this has definitely got   some wetness to it but of course is it going to  have the flavor well guys let's peep this out   and find out it's the all-new mesquite butter  bacon cheeseburger here at sonic let's do it yup absolutely yeah i'm definitely getting  a strong honey barbecue vibe with this one   with a little bit of butter coming up on  the back end after you're crunching into   everything else here guys this is actually very  very tasty and considering the debacle that was   the quote-unquote ultimate cheesesteaks that i  checked out the last time out this is a major   step in the right direction guys because  the quality so far is so much better than   that let's go for another bite and i'll  give you a close-up this is pretty good yeah just as i feared the bacon is a little on  the extra crispy side almost to the point where   it really feels a little burnt believe it or not  guys but everything else here is really singing in   the flavor department that honey barbecue action  is coming through the mesquite barbecue sauce   a lovely situation and there's plenty of pickles  which i'm already a fan of already here guys   all of that is going into the seared patty itself  which again has that nice buttery back end flavor   and honestly guys this is so much better  than the last time out that i was here   a very lovely situation with this burger so far  well i know this has got some grilled onions on   here guys because i'm getting some of the  flavor but admittedly also a little bit of   the grilled onions are a little on the burnt  side believe it or not so i think they're a   little extra grilled whoever was preparing  this obviously went a little extra mile   i think and kept things on there a little  too long but even still guys the quality   of what i'm getting here for everything  else is really coming together nicely so   i'm not going to knock it too much for that  because the experience is better but the juiciness   of the patty thanks to that mesquite butter is  a lovely situation and again it's a barbecue   butter and you're getting some of that smokiness  as well let's go for another bite on this one pickles i love them they're really good with  this and man that last bite had a little bit   of an extra kick when it comes to the bacon guys  and that's actually not a good thing because it's   a little overcooked in my opinion but even still  everything else that you're seeing on here does   a very nice job of delivering the flavor goods  and again the mesquite butter action is really   coming through on this along with that honey  barbecue sauce i am really digging this so far and   like i said i'm so glad it's so much of a better  experience compared to the last time out this is   a better bacon cheeseburger than i think i've had  in a very long time especially from sonic pretty   good and that's even with the slightly charred  bacon on top of it here yeah very lovely situation   with this thanks to that mesquite butter and the  honey barbecue sauce on this burger it's really   elevating the bacon cheeseburger in general and  that flavor like i said is delivering so one more   bite we'll close this one out after the rating but  thank god this was so good today guys because i   had my hopes up for it and i'm glad it's virtually  satisfied virtually i'll explain in a minute well this would have been almost the perfect  bacon cheeseburger eating action over here at   sonic today had the bacon itself been a little  bit less crispy guys it really is a little on   the burnt side and as i'm trying to go around here  for you so you can see everything i'm looking at   i think what i got was the tail end  of the grilled onions and that bacon   because everything else is really moving  nicely with this in the flavor department   the other stuff there like i said a little  too overcharred for my liking but even still   a lovely situation compared to the last time  out like i keep saying this is so much better well i gotta say it really does take a super  lackluster experience to physically show me   throwing something away on camera the way that  i did and considering the experience i had the   last time out with the quote unquote ultimate  cheesesteak here at sonic it was really warranted   because if you saw that review and again you can  find it in the upper right hand corner of your   display guys it was a no bueno situation that  completely deserved it but like many of you i   love a good redemption story so personally for me  this absolutely redeemed sonic at least for the   time being because this was a very good outing  this time out but considering what i reviewed   today the quality was definitely up there with the  exception of the bacon and the grilled onions like   I mentioned earlier just a little overcharred from  my liking so with that said i'm gonna have to give   the all-new mesquite butter bacon cheeseburger  here at sonic a pretty solid 8.2 out of 10 and   i'm giving it the .2 strictly because of  the amount of barbecue butter in that guys it was   a very wet cheeseburger and i have to admit  that really added the extra moisture that i   needed on top of the other flavors of that honey  barbecue sauce just a lovely combination with that   especially with the pickles guys that was really  the highlight for me on top of everything else   a decent amount of them and admittedly i have  to say this latest burger over here at sonic   really did remind me of the buttery jack somewhat  over here that we have in southern california for   jack-in-the-box it's very similar because of  the garlic herb butter they use there so i'm   loving the fact that sonic is kind of emulating  a little bit of that but with a little bit of a   barbecue flare definitely solid all right so i got  to ask you how delicious did this burger look to   you right now drop some comments down below how  did this actually appeal to you overall does this   actually wanna get you to jump on over to sonic  to give it a go and if you do give it a shot is   there anything you're going to add extra to maybe  kick it up even further maybe make it a double   drop those comments down below and definitely  let me know and with that this is Ian K   closing out another high quality foodie feature  for you here on peep this out reviews bringing   you brand new content every single week here on  my channel so while you stay tuned for that next
