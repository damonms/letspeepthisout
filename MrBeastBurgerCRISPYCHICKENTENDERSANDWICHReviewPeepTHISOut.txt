 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty hey everyone welcome back to another high quality  foodie feature for you here on the channel   cheaters cam style after hour is hitting up  postmates once again for a little mr beast   burger action but this time we're checking out  some of the all-new cluck cluck off their newly   launched menu so let's have at it feast your eyes  on their all new crispy chicken tender sandwich   and already this is very reminiscent of their  burger because the bun is exactly the same as   you can see it's fairly wide and definitely soft  let's pop it and take a look underneath looks like   nothing on the very top of this one here but  take a look at the chicken tenders themselves   not the ultra crispiest chicken tenders i've ever  seen but then again they're not too bad either   size is fairly decent you get two of them here  and they do look pretty good 100% white meat   underneath it we've got the basic fixings some mayo  some shredded lettuce and some pickles and that's   it so decent for what this is guys and again  the size is not too bad considering the price   point $6.99 for this one here delivered and it sure  smells pretty tasty so let's see if i can confirm   the goodness for you this is the all-new crispy  chicken tender sandwich from mr beast burger here   in pasadena california let's peep out this flavor  and again just like the mr beast burger beast style   combo that i reviewed recently i am really  digging the marketing guys i really love the   stickers that they put on the outside of this  here and it pretty much guarantees that they're   not going to be tampered with which is a cool  thing but talking about the sandwich here real   quick admittedly i'm not a super fan of tenders in  a sandwich like this naturally i really would have   preferred a larger piece of chicken to be honest  just all in one actually but considering what this   is this is not too bad we got the pickle action  effect here and again the size of the bun is very   reminiscent of the regular beast style burger it's  fairly large and again the price point not too bad   let's give it a shot guys it's the crispy chicken  tender sandwich from mr beast burger let's do it okay well i'm kind of getting some tyson  chicken tender vibes with this one here   right now guys this is actually not too  bad feast your eyes on the inside here   i'm gonna try and keep this as focused  as i can considering my lighting here   but it's okay for what this is the white meat  is fairly decent it's not super juicy at all   but the flavor is decent and naturally with one  of them peeking out the side here we'll get to   him in just a second the lettuce is fine  the pickles are actually okay as well and   naturally the mayo this is really kind of just  a basic chicken sandwich and that's really all   it's trying to be to be honest guys it's nice  to have the option on the menu but so far i'm   digging it it's not bad let's keep going in  let's go for that other side real fast here all right okay this is going to be kind  of a quick review because this really does   feel like something i can make at home  by getting some frozen chicken tenders   and pretty much just making this myself  but still for what this is this is not   bad at all guys i mean what you're getting  are two fairly decent sized chicken tenders   on the inside of a fairly decent sized  bun and again talking about that again   look at that the quality is nice on this it's  nice and soft it really hugs everything together   it's really meant more for the burgers as  it's supposed to be and as we flip it up here   a decent amount of mayo the pickles on the inside  the shredded lettuce it is what it is hopefully   we'll see like a standard like a larger chicken  patty and i would love to see something like   that actually instead of this but for what this  is this is actually not too bad so let's go for   a couple of quick more bites on this one i think  you get the point right now right it's all right i do like the pickle though the pickles  are actually pretty decent there   considering the quality of these not the  super thick cut that you're expecting   just trying to keep it focused there  but for what they are pretty decent   a nice crunch too but again i keep coming back  to it i really wish i had like a standard chicken   patty in here just a larger one because i think a  lot of people would expect that considering it's a   crispy chicken tender sandwich i mean it does say  it in the title so naturally you're going to be   getting tenders that's what you're expecting but  i would like to see at some point a much thicker   piece of chicken you know i may have to do that  hotter nashville chicken sandwich they have on   the menu if that's something that you think  you'd like to see at some point in the future   drop some comments down below and let me know but  for this guys it's nice to have a starter chicken   sandwich and this is why i wanted to start off  with this one and eventually maybe make my way   up to the other one but still i'm glad that  i checked this one out right now but again   this is really something you can pretty much  make on the fly at home if you've got those   ingredients it's very easy naturally it's very  basic but at the same time i don't know if i would   spend seven dollars on this again i'd probably  consider sticking with the burger or maybe that   hotter nashville chicken sandwich because it  definitely looked like it was a more sizeable   piece of chicken but still pretty good one more  bite we'll finish this one up after the rating but   i'm glad to have checked this one out especially  after hours with mr beast burger this is pretty good   well let's see if we can do a little 360 action on  this now i wouldn't consider this a hard pass guys   i mean it really is nice to have an option for a  chicken sandwich but considering what it is like i   said very very basic the crispiness of the chicken  is just all right the juiciness is not quite there   but the thickness is on point so i'm really  kind of digging that and again with the pickles   all the stuff you'd expect here the mayo  the lettuce and that soft bun it's still a   nice combination but again i don't think i'd be  paying seven dollars for this in the near future   unless they maybe do something else with the  tenders like maybe seasoning them in a different   way but other than that probably not just open  up your favorite delivery apps and search mr beast   burger so with that said i'm gonna have to give  the crispy chicken tender sandwich for mr beast   burger just in okay 6.5 out of 10  like i said it's pretty basic for what it is but   considering the price point is exactly the same  as the standard beast style that is gonna be way more   satisfying for what it is so if you need to have  a chicken option it's nice to have one on the menu   but even still guys the burger so far is a pretty  amazing situation if you haven't checked out my   review just yet on that one take a look at it  popping up on your screen here right now but when   it comes to this chicken sandwich let's just say  i'm very glad to have checked this one out because   like i also mentioned during that beast style combo  review they've got a pretty cool looking menu   over here with lots of goodies and i can't wait  to get into a few more of them in the near future   all right so i've got one simple question for you  right now based upon what you've seen in my review   with this crispy chicken tender sandwich would you  personally pay $6.99 for this drop some comments   down below and let me know and while we're at  it how long did it take for you to get your food   because for me this time out it was another 40  45 minute thing so let me know if you guys are   having any luck getting it a lot sooner but hey  i'm just glad that it's available so if you guys   have in your area how are you doing in terms of  the wait times drop those comments down below and   definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K  closing out another high quality foodie feature   for you here on peep this out reviews cheaters cam  style after hours bringing you brand new content   every single week here on my channel so while you stay tuned for that next review coming real soon in
