 hey everyone and welcome or welcome back to the  channel it's Ian K where today i'm over at bk   to finish out the trifecta that is my look  and reviews of their all-new whopper melts   that's right so stay tuned because  the bacon whopper melt is up next   welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty all right here we go with what looks to be  another banger at least in the presentation   department already guys feast your eyes on the  bacon whopper melt and already there is plenty   of stacker sauce goodness to be had with  this one and of course the cheesy goodness   is looking pretty awesome as well let's get  started with this one by breaking it on down   so here we go with that toasted bread action and  once we pop the top you're going to notice a whole   bunch of stacker sauce along with caramelized  onions but guys panning on down you're gonna   see even more of that good stuff they really  lathered this one up pretty nicely we've got   two strips of bacon it looks like there and that's  all sitting on top of two whopper junior patties   and i gotta say a quarter pound of beef is  looking pretty nice smothered in all that goodness   lots of cheesy goodness to go with as well you're  gonna see american cheese all throughout this   but i gotta say guys the combination of stacker  sauce bacon caramelized onions and that cheese   that combo is looking very gluttonous and very  delicious and the aroma in the car is absolutely   confirming it because there's plenty of bacon and  stacker sauce action going on with this one guys   really really nice so there you go it's the  breakdown of the all-new bacon whopper melt   here at bk let's peep out this flavor yeah  this thing presents very well and guys it's   very enticing to know that this is gonna be a  very flavorful situation i think just looking   at it is absolutely awesome right now with the  caramelized onions the stacker sauce and the smell   of the bacon in the air on top of it guys a lovely  situation so without further ado one last time   let's complete the trifecta it's the all-new  bacon whopper melt here at bk let's peep this out oh oh whoa all right first off if you're wondering if  bacon makes everything better yes especially   when it comes to these whopper melts here at bk  that is a lovely situation guys crispy action   on top of the sweetness that i'm getting  from the stacker sauce and the cheese   and of course the flame grilled beef as usual  this toasted bun here is not really toasted in   presentation it does look like it but it's kind  of on the softer side but all of those flavors are   incredible and then you get into the caramelized  onions a very lovely situation on this one and   guys it really heightens the experience very  delicious let's keep going this is pretty awesome whoa well the flavor is absolutely off the  chart with this one guys that hickory smoke   crunchiness that i'm getting from the bacon  itself is adding so much to the stacker sauce   the cheese and of course the flame grilled  beef on this one the quarter pound of beef   never tasted so good in a smaller package like  this and when you add in the caramelized onions   in that stacker sauce guys a beautiful situation  this is very gluttonous very delicious and easily   probably one of the top versions of this by far  the bacon really does elevate this one nicely   and here i thought the original whopper melt that  i just did a few days ago is actually going to be   the one to top because naturally the presentation  looked pretty awesome on this but just thinking   about the idea of having bacon with it on top of  it guys now i see this is the one to get by far   it's easily worth it because bacon obviously  makes everything better it's working so nicely   with everything here and the light crispiness  that i'm getting on top of it is a beautiful   situation on top of all the other flavors  here so let's go for another couple on this   one guys a very lovely situation and again i  just wish it was a little bit more toastier in   actual mouthfeel with this one but the  presentation does look pretty nice but   these are a little on the small side but at the  same time super delicious let's keep going in it's so good you know before i even open this  one up out of the package it looked like it was   going to be pretty tall to begin with in terms of  just the size because naturally it's not so much   big as it is tall but what you're getting on the  inside of this is the flavor to match and that's   the beautiful thing because all those flavors  are mixing beautifully and again guys just to   keep showing it to you the bacon is adding so  much to the caramelized onions with that sweet   stacker sauce on top of it i'm not really minding  the fact that it feels a little bit more elevated   this time around but man the cheese and all that  goodness that you're seeing here is making this   extremely pleasurable to eat right now and of  course it feels more like a breakfast situation   because i'm having this kind of early too and  i'm loving the experience it's really awesome   and on the reel just between you and me i think  the only way to really improve upon this one is   to possibly add maybe a fried egg on top of it  to kind of make this a super breakfast type of   situation because guys my all-time favorite king  burger is the farmhouse king and i would love to   see something like that with this because  this is very reminiscent of that because of   the stacker sauce situation believe it or not so  adding a fried egg i think would be a beautiful   situation still but what you're getting with the  bacon and everything else on this guys it's a   very delicious mini large bacon cheeseburger  so to speak because like i said it's small   but tall and thick at the same time as well  so pretty awesome all right so let's go for   one more bite on this one before we wrap  the review up with the rating coming up   next but guys another banger of a situation  and probably the best version in my opinion   to go with when you go with one of these whopper  melts over here at bk bacon truly does make   everything better this is an awesome option to go  in on one more bite and we'll close it out hang on well these whopper melts sure do feel like mini  stacker kings just with a different bun guys but   all the quality flavors and the vintage flavors  that you're going to be getting from bk with   that stacker sauce are going to really go hand in  hand with each other here with that hickory smoked   bacon flavor on top of it it is a beautiful  situation guys a lot of tasty goodness with   this one with plenty of caramelized onions and  naturally a lot of that stacker sauce is a good   thing because it goes pretty nicely with this guys  very very tasty overall and definitely the best   version of my opinion to go with definitely give  this one a shot with bacon it is pretty awesome   so jumping right to it i'm gonna have to give the  all-new bacon whopper melt here at bk the obvious   10 out of 10 guys this is easily my favorite  version when it comes to the three that i've now   completed here on the channel and i have to say  again the quality of the bacon the crispiness of   the bacon really elevated the already awesome  flavor of that whopper melt to begin with   to new levels it really is the way to go and i  gotta tell you again with all the vintage flavors   that bk is known for over the years this is easily  a heightened situation right now because of the   stacker sauce and of course just the combination  of the beef the caramelized onions are a nice   touch the only thing of course is the toastiness  of that bread is not necessarily toasty in mouth   feel but the overall experience is pretty nice so  for a hyper patty melt-like situation what you're   going to be getting is really a mini version  of a stacker king with the whopper name because   it's using those whopper junior patties but even  still a beautiful situation and again something   super delicious to check out definitely give this  one a go with bacon it rocks all right so do me a   quick favor because i'm curious drop some comments  down below out of all of the three whopper melts   available here at bk which was your personal  favorite and why i mean which was the
