 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty hey everyone it's ian k for peep this out reviews back at it once again cheaters cam style after hours here at carl's jr to go in on what they're calling one monster of an angus thick burger so let's see if it's true as we go in on the monster angus thick burger here at carl's jr and already the aroma in my car is lighting up beautifully with that 100% black angus beef goodness guys i think i'm in for some good stuff here starting off with that seeded bun on the very top let's take a look underneath it we'll deconstruct it from top to bottom we've got some mayo we've got two slices of that bacon that's in there as well we've got a slice of cheese and of course a third pound patty of black angus beef goodness let's definitely get that cheesy goodness right there guys a lovely situation that's the second slice of cheese and underneath that the third slice of cheese and two more strips of bacon so three slices of cheese four strips of bacon and a very lovely situation indeed right there guys and like i said the smell is pretty awesome it's a basic build but a very meaty and tasty looking build at that let's see if the flavor is going to deliver on this one how could it possibly not it's the monster angus thick burger here at carl's jr let's peep out this flavor so two third pound patties of 100% black angus beef or as i like to call it two-third pounds of beefy meaty cheesy goodness guys i mean overall no matter how you slice it this is a ridiculous situation just look at that a basic build like i said but with all that meat the cheese the bacon how could this possibly fail unless it's just not made correctly and i got to admit it's very hot in my hands right now so a lovely situation indeed and of course we're going to get into it but like always if you guys are fans of high quality delicious looking food reviews make sure to hit that subscribe button down below and don't forget to tap

right out the gate this is banging already with all that meat and cheese of course i got everything in that first bite so let's get right down to it guys a very juicy situation this is not dry at all and you can actually see how beautiful the meat looks on this one here a lot of bacon a lot of cheese it's very basic but it's everything that carl's jr does extremely well on overload so a lovely situation because it's a double cheeseburger but guys super super delicious already let's go for another bite and we're going to keep going in with these close-ups this thing is pretty bomb it really is let me get you right in there again guys plenty of melted cheese with three slices on this beast it is no wonder that this is definitely a lovely situation in the cheese department because you can taste the cheese very dramatically and i'm saying it that way because that's how it really tastes it's very wholesome very hearty and i gotta admit with the bacon on top of it the smokiness coming from that everything is blending with that 100% black angus beef and i got to keep saying 100% because you can really taste the quality of that beef it's really really tasty but definitely gluttonous to say the least and obviously with this amount of meat on here of course it's going to be gluttonous for what it is so i think it's worthy of that monster name but believe it or not i think they could have gone into the half pound route and still called it a monster because naturally i think a half pound burger sounds better for advertising compared to two-thirds now don't get me wrong there is plenty of meat on this plenty of cheese plenty of bacon but a half pound variant that would be pretty amazing as well so let's go for another bite on this one let's keep going in because guys i really want to this is a fun time to do this right now and it's so delicious because it's tender it's fresh it's juicy let's do it man i'm getting a serious case of the meat sweats going into this one right now guys and i'm not even really halfway in and it's super cool as i'm filming this right now as well at night so guys let's get into the bacon situation real fast fairly crispy i gotta admit it's definitely standing out in the flavor department and it blends so beautifully with the cheese on this one that american cheese the meltiness of it the fact that you're getting four slices total of bacon to go with the three slices of cheese that is a very lovely situation add that in with the juiciness of that angus beef and you really have just a winner of a double cheeseburger but guys it's gluttonous it's awesome it's a simple build you don't really need a sauce on this one it doesn't really need it i'm not even tasting the mayo which is a good thing so let's go for one more bite of this one we'll close this one out after the rating but guys it's as delicious as you'd expect it to be it's beef it's cheese it's bacon and it's definitely a bomb situation so one more bite and we'll close this one out hang on all right let's take off the burger diaper to go 360 on this one guys take a look at the gluttonous good stuff that this one has to offer it really is the epitome of a fast food burger and i gotta say i am loving the amount of beef loving the amount of cheese loving the amount of bacon everything this one has to offer and like i said a simple build is sometimes all you really need nice and juicy and the beef is just flat out awesome very tasty on this one well there's really nothing else i can say about this one aside from the fact that it was made very well it was super fresh and ultra delicious so overall i'm gonna have to give the monster angus thick burger here at carl's jr a rock solid 9 out of 10 the only way i can really see to improve this one is like i mentioned earlier take this one into half pound territory and really go to town with it because as it stands that's still very hearty but guys it's a delicious cheeseburger either way and having it at night is even a bonus i'm just telling you right now it's so much fun filming this way which brings me to a question for you do you guys like eating cheeseburgers super late at night drop
