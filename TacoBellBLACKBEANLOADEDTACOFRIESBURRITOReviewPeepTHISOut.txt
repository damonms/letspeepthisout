 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty what's going on everyone and welcome back to  another high quality foodie feature for you   here on the channel cheaters cam style after  hours back on over at taco bell to check out   the burrito version of their all-new loaded taco  fries now available with a cool new protein option   instead of their standard beef that's right  and you already know what it is it's their   black bean loaded taco fries burrito here at  taco bell definitely a mouthful of a title but   then again we've got a mouthful of ingredients  to get into with this one so what you're looking   at here split in half is a warm flour tortilla  that's filled with their popular nacho fries of   course featuring those bold mexican spices along  with black beans red strips lettuce diced tomatoes   nacho cheese sauce spicy ranch and shredded  cheddar cheese so definitely a laundry list of   ingredients with this one but as i'm looking at  this further i'm really hoping there's a little   bit more nacho fries than what's on display here  maybe looks about six or seven split in half here   i don't know but let's just get into it and we'll  find out together this is the all-new black bean   loaded taco fries burrito here at taco bell let's  peep out this flavor yesir this one definitely   presents pretty well when you cut it in half  guys lots of really awesome color with all those   ingredients on display but with the main star of  the show being the nacho fries themselves let's   just say i really hope i have a little bit more  on the inside of this one and considering i just   reviewed the black bean loaded taco fries recently  given the three dollar price point for that main   version i think what i'm paying for here is the  convenience of having it wrapped up good to go   but even still with all the other ingredients i'm  sure it's going to taste very similar let's just   give it a shot it's the all new black bean loaded  taco fries burrito here at taco bell let's do it yup it's exactly the same just wrapped up  good to go but honestly after that first   bite with very little nacho fries to speak of  it's all the other ingredients together and   i think that's why they pack it this way and  honestly guys i really think they should just   make this burrito more substantial i think just  making it larger would kind of cure some of that   you'd be able to get more fries into it and  just basically make just a bigger product   you're already charging more for it so what  you're paying for so far is the convenience of   having it wrapped up easier but even still  it's less food let's just keep going in it's tasty though being that i cut this burrito  in half and as i'm working my way towards the end   i'm beginning to see that all i really have here  is about maybe six or seven total nacho fries in   this burrito guys and that's a no bueno situation  you're really eating all the other toppings on   the inside of the actual tortilla and that's not  bad because the flavor is decent it's taco bell   but even still there is hardly any nacho fries to  speak of it's just a little bit of a hint of it   with each bite and that was only bite number two  so while i'm digging the flavor of what i'm having   here right now honestly it's not very fulfilling  compared to just getting these fries on their own   in the way that i reviewed them recently i gotta  say guys that was a much better situation visually   there was a lot more going on with it that you can  see because it was just more plentiful toppings in   general but with this like i said you're paying  for the convenience essentially because it's   easier to eat this way but even still why wouldn't  they just make a bigger burrito to kind of give   you something more to kind of go with it like that  i mean they've done plenty of grande type burritos   in the past xxl burritos and if you take a look  at the playlist popping up on your screen here   right now i've done a whole bunch of reviews  over the years here at taco bell with burritos   that are a lot bigger than this so obviously  with all the hype of nacho fries why wouldn't   you just make it just a bigger burrito especially  for the price point you're charging more let's go   for another couple of bites guys but so far it's  a little lackluster but even still it's alright well as i'm getting to the end of this  half i gotta say this experience is a   little forgettable for me right now guys i'm  probably not gonna be getting this one again   it's kind of cool that every time they come out  with the nacho fries in some configuration of   course they're gonna throw together something  in a burrito but even still this needs to be   bigger there needs to be more in it naturally  and you do have plenty of toppings believe me   but with the nacho fries being one of the  main stars of the show carbiness aside   you want to have more of that in there just make  it more substantial for the money even if you're   going to charge like five bucks for it make it  bigger i think visually be that much more and   honestly you'd be getting more for the money so  it is what it is so let's go for one more bite   on this one i'd probably recommend passing on  it and sticking with the regular variation that   they're advertising all over the place you're  gonna get a lot more food for the money it's   $2.99 but even still guys it is what it is  with this let's just go for one more bite well i gotta say the only thing saving this  for me right now believe it or not is not   the nacho fries themselves it's the black beans  along with the spicy ranch and the nacho cheese   sauce that is a lovely combination indeed it's  very hearty and very filling and just like the   previous version that i reviewed let me just  say guys this is just that on a smaller scale   on the inside of a warm tortilla but like i said  i really wish there was just more food in here   for the money but all the flavors definitely are  pretty awesome aside from the nacho fries kind of   sad to say it that way but it's true order ahead  and pick yours up at our contactless drive-thru   so with that said i'm gonna have to give the black  bean loaded taco fries burrito here at taco bell   barely a 7 out of 10 like i just mentioned  the only thing that's really scoring points at   least for me right now is really the spicy  ranch the cheddar cheese sauce along with   those black beans the combination really fills  out everything flavor-wise and guys honestly   everything else is pretty plentiful on the inside  of that as much as it can be given what's on the   inside of that burrito it's still very small and  like i said hardly any nacho fries to speak of   carbiness aside if you're going to come out with  something like this you gotta make it more   substantial especially if you're charging more  money and you're getting less food technically   for what i got here right now no bueno on that  no bueno at all alright so aside from asking   if you're going to be giving this one a go because  like i always say if you've made it this far into   the review chances are you're probably going to  do me a quick favor drop some comments down below   answer one simple question for me do you prefer  the platter version of these nacho fries or the   burrito variant because there's obviously a reason  why taco bell makes the burrito even though it's   smaller do a lot of people like the burritos over  the regular platters even though you're getting   more food that way drop some comments down below  and definitely let me know and with that this is   Ian K closing out another high quality foodie  feature for you here on peep this out reviews   cheaters cam style after hours bringing you brand  new content every single week here on my channel   so while you stay tuned for that next review coming  real soon in the meantime stay frosty all right   taco bell fyi this is not a cravings value menu  item so please please please don't build it like   one at almost four bucks this needs more filling i  mean come on at least put some more nacho fries in   alright everyone until next time i'll talk to  you soon hey thanks for checking out another one   of my reviews but just in case you didn't see the  one before this one
