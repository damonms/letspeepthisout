 [Music] welcome to peep this out reviews with  Ian K stay frosty what's going on everyone   and welcome to the channel where today I'm over at  Papa John's to take a look at their latest promo   which looks to be winging it so to speak with  a brand new Hot Wings flavor and you know what   hot is exactly what it's supposed to be guys Feast  your eyes on what I've got here it's their all-new   hot lemon pepper wings and I gotta say these are  Sauced up good to go and I am super excited to get   into these these they're looking pretty great  let's break this one on down for you real fast   yes sir I'm always down for some good old hot  wings and this version looks pretty solid already   all right guys what you looking at here very  simply are some of their oven baked wings here   at Papa John's that are tossed in a new hot lemon  pepper sauce that features a kick of mild heat   and zest and I gotta say you can definitely smell  that lemon goodness in the car guys this is pretty   nice and they look fairly meaty a nice little  distribution of flats and drums pretty solid   for dipping you've got your choice of sauce but  Naturally by default it comes with ranch and you   guys all know I'm down with that so absolutely  I can't wait to get into that but guys again   presentation wise these definitely look Sauced  up ready to go and we are definitely gonna do   that right now so without further Ado here you  go it's the all-new hot lemon pepper wings here   at Papa John's let's peep out this flavor yes sir  nicely Sauced up Good To Go Guys these are looking   really really cool and you know what also looks  really cool this packaging that it comes in take a   look at this real quick I am totally digging that  little Papa John's action on the outside it gives   you a chance to shake these up even more but very  cool and of course you've got a little container   in the back for the dip so naturally with that  ranch sauce action a very nice presentation very   nice indeed and guys lemon pepper just so you  know it's one of my all-time favorites over at   Wingstop now that's a dry version over there so  this one's definitely wet let me pick up one of   these I'm gonna give this a shot and wow these  are very very nice guys nicely Sauced up I'm a   fan of the drums if you guys are fans of flats  let me know Down Below in the comment section   but this is looking nicely Sauced guys very very  cool all right enough Chit Chat let's get down to   business these are the all-new hot lemon pepper  wings here at Papa John's let's peep this out mmm lemon is strong oh a little bit of heat  not bad though yeah that Sizzle is nice   well right off the break the lemon zest  is very strong on these guys you're gonna   notice that right away and of course with  the bone and Wing action that's always a   fun experience the sizzle that I'm getting from  the heat is very mild but it's definitely there   in the background but a very nice creamy flavor  overall this is really nice let's keep going in   mmm that is tasty a lot of lemon goodness I just  love how profound that lemon really is guys and   one more time just to show you my fingers are  definitely lit up here and the focus is trying   to stay focused nice flavor overall I wouldn't  say it's more like a Tabasco type of heat but   it's got that Vibe actually but the lemon is  really really nice in this let's go for one   more bite we'll get into another one with some  ranch this is pretty good mmm fairly meaty too yeah that is pretty good I am very much digging  the amount of lemon zest in that that is a very   lovely situation all right guys let's get  into some ranch action of course this will   definitely help cool things down just a bit  I'm thinking because naturally it's Ranch of   course you expect that right definitely good  stuff and let me grab another one of these wow   this is very nice take a look at that nicely  Sauced up there this one's a little bit more   heavier than the other but guys loving this all  around let's go into this when I dip you dip we   dip you already know freak nasty good stuff keep  that Focus right there very very nice here we go mmm wow I was losing my voice there for  a minute that heat is pretty nice though   yes sir as expected the creamy coolness of  the ranch is totally combining beautifully   with the flavors of the lemon zest as well as  the light heat that I'm getting with this one   as well guys let's go for another couple on  this that is loveliness right there trying   to keep that focus in but it is very very solid  with this combination of ranch like I said I'm a   huge fan of ranch anyway this is definitely  banging let's go for another couple meatiness personified that's really good so yeah guys pretty tasty  On These Wings over here at Papa John's with   this all new hot lemon pepper I have to say I  am digging the quality of it there but there's   actually one aspect about it which I'll talk  about towards the end for the wrap up that I   wish they would improve upon but first things  first before we wrap up the review with the   rating coming up next I need to go for one more  and see if I can take down one of these Flats   in one bite so I'm gonna go for a little bit of  that ranch action right there and we'll see if   we can try and take this one down this one's a  little bit more of a smaller medium-sized Wing   let's give this a shot and see how this one's  gonna go so hang on for that rating coming up   but I'm gonna try and take care of business here  we go [Applause] mm-hmm success banging tasty well here's one more shot of one of the drums guys  and again a fairly meaty situation and I have to   say the combination of the sauce works very nicely  here that hot lemon pepper action absolutely has   the lemon zest it has definitely a kick of heat  and I really am liking the overall quality once   you combine it with that ranch a nice combination  and something definitely worth checking out   especially if you're down with wings this is  pretty good so with that said I'm gonna have   to give the all-new hot lemon pepper wings here at  Papa John's a pretty solid 7.9 out of 10 and guys   the reason why I'm going a little bit lower than  normal considering how tasty these were is because   the price point is a little elevated I mean $11.99  for eight Wings is really asking a lot considering   what these are naturally the flavor really does  deliver though so I would recommend giving the   flavor a shot for sure but just be prepared  for a little bit of sticker shock on this   one thankfully like I said the flavor is pretty  awesome the combination of the lemon zest a little   bit of the heat goes a long way the really cool  packaging that it comes in on top of it so it's   very much easy to eat in the car and again like I  said the overall flavor does deliver it's a really   nice combo with that ranch and I have to say again  very solid overall and an easy recommendation to   give this one a shot either solo dolo or with  one of the pizzas preferably maybe the crispy   parm Pizza which I just reviewed you're probably  seeing that jumping up on your screen here right   now that was very tasty I think that would be a  pretty good pairing but still like I said a little   bit of a sticker shock on this one all right so  drop those comments down below let me know what   you thought of these hot lemon pepper wings here  at Papa John's are you gonna be giving this one   a shot and when you do give it a go tell me what  your thoughts are overall did that flavor really   deliver for you drop those comments down below and  definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K   closing out another high quality foodie feature
