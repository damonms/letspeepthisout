 yes sir a very saucy situation on this one  guys i'm totally digging how this is looking   glistening in the sun here right now very  very excited to get into this but what i'm   more excited about on top of anything is the fact  that i've got pickles this time out i actually   had those missing from the first version of  us that i checked out which you're probably   seeing up on your screen here right now and hey  i know it was the plain version of it naturally   the intro version of these chicken sandwiches  but they are supposed to come with pickles so   thankfully we've got them this time around  and again they look really nice that green   is contrasting beautifully with all the  saucy goodness of that spicy korean cue   so let's give this a shot guys i'm excited one  last time before we get into it it's the all-new   spicy korean q variant of the brand new chicken  sandwich here at wingstop let's peep this out man these things are crazy juicy already wow
