 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty it looks like BK is bringing back their version of an Italian classic now available across all versions of its chicken so let's go in and the grilled chicken parm to see what this one's working with and as always we've got that potato bun that BK loves to use with all their chicken sandwiches let's pop it take a look underneath looks like a nice slice of mozzarella cheese we've got some marinara sauce there as well and underneath that mozzarella we should have some yes some shaved parmesan in there as well and that's sitting all on top of a 100% white meat chicken breast fillet let me see if I can pull this back just a little bit pretty decent-size guys you can see the grill marks looking pretty nice definitely a very saucy situation and a cheesy one speaking of more sauce we've got more of that on the very bottom this actually looks really decent guys I know chicken parm you're thinking it should be breaded and I did enjoy checking out that version of it the first time around but this looks really really good just as is and you got to love that there's plenty of sauce on this along with that mozzarella cheese and the shaved parmesan to go with your guys but looking really really good let's dive into this right now because like I said it smells and looks pretty fantastic it's the grilled chicken parmesan sandwich here at BK let's peep out this flavor so are you a fan of high-quality delicious looking food reviews well if so definitely hit that subscribe button down below and don't forget to tap that Bell icon so you could be notified as soon as new content drops every week now let's dive into this one it's the grilled chicken parmesan sandwich here in BK mmm the light tang of that marinara sauce goes amazingly well with the shaved parmesan guys and speaking of the shaved parmesan it's got a nice tartness and pungentness to it that I remember from the first time around if you guys want to see what the regular version of the chicken parm is like for me hit the video in the upper right hand corner of a display to check that one out but the grilled chicken version so far is pretty tasty guys let's keep going mmm the nice gooey meltiness of that mozzarella cheese goes amazingly well with everything else and while I am missing the breading from the chicken patty itself I really am glad I'm checking out this version of it because it does feel a little bit lighter but you can really taste all the other components nicely on top of the potato bun which is actually a really nice situation as well and here I thought the grilled chicken might be a little on the drier side because like I always say and most of you probably know this already white meat tends to be a little bit drier in general but guys there's plenty of sauce on this and the flavorfulness of that cheese is really really tasty it's a simple ingredients list but it works very well mmm that marinara is getting me right over here guys and when you mix in the tartness of those shaved parmesan pieces which are actually pretty sizable you're getting a nice combination of goodness mmm really tart man I'm really glad this sandwich is back it's been close to two years since my original review and it makes me want to revisit the original version of this off camera but I can tell you guys I'm gonna be enjoying the sandwich during this promo time it's worth your time let me rotate this one a bit just to close this one out for you and as you can see the white meat is definitely sizable it's a nice piece of chicken with a very nice amount of toppings to go with I really dig the fact that the cheese is really standing out above and beyond and the sauce goes amazingly well guys just a delicious chicken sandwich I think the matter which version you get but I would recommend the grilled it is pretty good there's plenty of sauce on that one so have plenty of napkins on hand and as you can tell by that bun kind of falling apart there it is definitely worth your time either way messy or not I would easily recommend this one for ya so with all that said I'm gonna have to give the grilled Parmesan chicken sandwich here at BK a rock-solid 9.3 out of 10 the only thing holding this one back is the price point being it's a little bit elevated and the size being just a little bit smaller it's still hearty don't get me wrong it's just not as wide as I would have liked it considering the price point that it goes for but guys the flavor is still on point and like I said that's really the paramount thing here you're gonna dig it if you're hungry and if you like Italian food in general I think you're gonna want to check this one out anyway but of course the obvious question is are you drop some comments down below are you already a fan of the chicken parmesan sandwich here at BK and if you are are you gonna be giving this version of it a shot if not the regular drop those comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K closing out another episode of peep this out bringing you brand new content every single week here on my channel so while you stay tuned for the
