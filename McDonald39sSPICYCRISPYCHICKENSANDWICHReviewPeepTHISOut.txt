 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty what's going on everyone welcome back to another  high quality foodie feature for you here on the   channel cheaters cam style after hours once again  over at mcdonald's to check out another selection   off of their all-new chicken sandwich lineup and  this one looks to be bringing a little bit of heat   so let's get into it feast your eyes on their  all-new spicy chicken sandwich and we're already   in familiar potato roll territory just like  the crispy chicken sandwich before it guys   but as you can see nice and shiny let's take a  look underneath and it looks like i have maybe   a dollop of what's supposed to be spicy pepper  sauce here and so far guys a little underwhelming   because i'm expecting a little bit more sauce  but as you can see on the chicken patty itself   we've got two crinkle cut pickles and maybe a  little bit more of that sauce that's kind of   spilled over but this chicken patty definitely  looks more sizable than the last time out   and i'm really hoping there's going to be a little  bit more of that white meat action considering how   sizable this patty is actually guys it's looking  pretty nice there lightly breaded and fried and   i got to admit it looks really really great  underneath it maybe a little bit more of that   sauce action is present but it looks like it's  more of a spillover from the top and again i think   it's going to be the theme with this particular  one but there's only two pickles that are going to   be on these chicken sandwiches i've only got two  here and the size of the sandwich itself really   does warrant three but at the same time it's got  the accent of the pickle goodness on it let's   just see how it is guys this is the all-new spicy  chicken sandwich here at mcdonald's let's do it better much better the juiciness is still on point with this one  and the fact that it's more of a sizable piece   of chicken is making a huge difference right  now but because the sauce being so light on   this particular one i'm not really tasting  anything above and beyond the patty itself   which is good it's a little bit on the salty  side just a little bit to me but at the same   time the juiciness is pretty banging on  it guys let's go for another bite we'll   go for close-up on this one but it's a better  experience so far compared to the last time out all right so judging after that second bite and  considering the close-ups that you've already   seen with this particular one the sauce is  virtually non-existent i mean there's a little bit   of something there maybe some light tanginess and  the sizzle is kind of there in the background but   at the same time it's not really differentiating  compared to the crispy chicken sandwich that i   just did but at the same time the quality is  better on this one as you can see the patty   a little bit more robust on the inside there's a  lot of white meat i'm digging that and the coating   to meat ratio is actually very nice again maybe  about 80 20 on this guys it really feels much   more substantial and since i've been mentioning  it pretty much since the beginning of this review   after checking out that crispy chicken sandwich  which you're probably seeing popping up on your   screen here right now if you haven't seen that  review definitely check it out this like i said   is a better experience overall i just wish i had  a little bit more sauce so where the last time out   that one really didn't satisfy because the  quantity of the chicken was a little on the   light side now the sauce is light on this one so  it kind of is hit or miss so far with the launch   of this i know it's a new thing but at the same  time the quality is pretty decent but again five   bucks for something like this guys at least this  feels a little bit more substantial price wise   to go with the meat on the inside so it's kind of  good in that regard because i'm not really feeling   as ripped off because of the size of the chicken  let's go for another bite and we'll keep going in yeah that larger chicken patty is making a  huge difference right now and now i got a   little bit more of that extra sauce i think i  matched up with the top and bottom of this one   but so far guys like i said it's a light sizzle  supposed to be like a spicy pepper type of sauce   i'm not really getting that so much pepper but the  sizzle is definitely there quality so far pretty   nice on this and honestly i think it's because i  got a good one here so let me go for one more bite   we'll close this one up after the rating it's kind  of a simple sandwich at the same time but it is   delivering flavor-wise and i'm thankful for that  on top of the size being bigger one more bite and   we'll finish it up as i'm always saying in the  comments section whenever you guys are talking   about how the size of the food that you get is  not that great or something is not up to snuff   if you're not satisfied with what you've got  you definitely want to take this one back but   obviously since i'm reviewing it i gotta rate them  as i get them so with this i'm thankful if the   patty itself is large but i definitely would have  taken it back to get a little bit more sauce to   be honest guys because i'm really not tasting too  much of it on here but at the same time the patty   itself is delivering and overall this does feel  like a more satisfying chicken sandwich and i'm   still digging the fact that these sandwiches come  in these foil pouches guys because that really   is the industry standard type of packaging for  these things everybody's doing it now so mickey   d's definitely has a good thing going by kind of  emulating that really digging that flame on the   outside kind of cool actually all right so with  that said i'm gonna have to give the spicy chicken   sandwich here at mickey d's a pretty decent 7.5 out of 10 i'm not gonna go much higher   than that because i don't think this is the be all  end all of chicken sandwiches it's great to see a   revamped type of chicken sandwich on the menu over  here and it emulates the other guys in a way that   i think is gonna satisfy a lot of people at the  same time your mileage may vary on the size of   the chicken that you get and that's one thing  i'm going to be watching very closely in the   comment section to see if you've had experiences  very similar to mine so far so if the chicken is   going to be as good as it's supposed to be you  want it to be sizeable all around you don't want   to have to worry about the size of the chicken  that you're going to be getting and so far at   least this is a better experience for me but truth  be told i'm really hoping you're going to have a   solid experience for yourself so do me a quick  favor drop some comments down below if you've   had this one already how has your experience been  very simply drop those comments down below and   definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K  closing out another high quality foodie feature   for you here on peep this out reviews cheaters  cam style after hours bringing you brand new   content every single week here on my channel so  while you stay tuned for that next review coming real soon   in the meantime stay frosty yeah this one had a  hint of spice especially towards the end but it   could have been so much better had it had just  a little bit more of that spicy pepper sauce   alright guys until next time i'll talk to you  soon hey thanks for checking out another one of   my reviews but just in case you didn't see the one  before this one you can find it right up over here   along what i think youtube's gonna recommend  for you to check out as well as
