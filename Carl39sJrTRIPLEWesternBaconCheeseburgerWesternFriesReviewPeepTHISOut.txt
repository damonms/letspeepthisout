 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty Carl's jr. is definitely going big on one of its classics and just for good measure it looks like they're shaken up some of their fries too that's right it's flavor lip by fire as we're going in on the triple western bacon cheeseburger and guys this looks very very intense right now one of the signature burgers if not the signature burger from Carl's jr. and I got to admit this looks pretty awesome let's pop the top Oh plenty of that signature barbecue sauce in effect there lots of bacon on the very top there as well and of course looks like we've got those huge patties of meat guys three of them here American cheese let me split this up here just a bit oh man dee-licious dee-licious let's go down one more layer and pull this apart again oh man ridiculous I am digging this and I'm really loving the fact that it's all sitting on top of their crispy onion rings but guys a very meaty situation indeed definitely excess overload on what to expect with this one here and as you can see it looks really really great on the side we've got some of their new Western fries which are described as basically they're salty fries as normal but they're sprinkled with Western bacon cheeseburger seasoning so obviously we've got some barbecue action it looks like it's gonna really simulate maybe a little bit of the cheesiness in there as well too and on the side of course classic barbecue sauce for dipping guys looking very very good and a nice little compliment to whatever size burger you get whether it's the single to double or the triple guys this looks really really insane let's get into this right now it's the triple cheeseburger the triple Western bacon cheeseburger here Carl's jr. along with the Western fries

definitely had the western bacon cheeseburger plenty of times in the past but I've never had it in triple form let's give it a shot and see I think this is gonna be pretty amazing here we go   mmm-hmm super thick man that's almost too much because of the onion ring at the same time all three layers of the meat the cheese the bacon the barbecue sauce definitely gluttonous but amazing let's go for another bite this is pretty awesome mmm well as you can see Carl's jr. knows how to bring that charbroiled game with a party with this one all the signature flavors of the Western bacon cheeseburger are on display the smokiness of the barbecue sauce the pseudo-crispness of the bacon is just a little on the flimsier side but still a little bit crunchy and guys plenty of cheese plenty of the beef as you can see 100% all across the board and of course on the very bottom that's really the wild-card the onion rings add an extra layer to this but man it is very very tasty yeah I am definitely enjoying this one right now but I have to be honest in the back of my mind I'm thinking about that Godzilla thickburger they actually have exclusively in Mexico at the moment as you can see that promo burger looks very similar to the one I'm having right now minus the onion rings and the barbecue sauce but it's pretty much the same thing with maybe a little extra mayo added but I got to be honest this actually feels more like a Godzilla burger because of the onion rings adding the onion rings on top of everything else adds just a little bit more to it so if you ask me nothing against what they have in Mexico because it looks cool this is the Godzilla thickburger as far as far as I'm concerned because guys it is thick look at that let's keep going again mmm one more quick shot before we get into the fries and let me just take this one around 360 for you as you can see the meat and cheese hanging out the back on this one and there is still plenty of bacon I only wish and I don't believe I'm even saying this right now that there was maybe an extra onion ring or two on this one because two onion rings for all this stuff here is not really cutting it but man very gluttonous and like I said all the signature flavors of Carl's jr. on display in their iconic western bacon cheeseburger now let's get into those western fries let me give you another quick close-up of these up close and as you can see they are dusted very very nicely essentially they're thrown into just kind of a tin and they're tossed around with the seasoning but supposedly western bacon cheeseburger seasoning at that let's see if it delivers all right and I've got that barbecue sauce ready to go let's give this a shot they are very nicely dusted let's do it mmm it does taste like the Western that's pretty good nice hints of barbecue smokiness but not so much a cheeseburger as though the seasoning is supposed to actually have I'm not really tasting anything cheesy like it does feel like it's more potatoey for some reason if I can say it that way just a little bit more richer in that department let's give it a go with the barbecue sauce and see if that enhances it of course it does that's actually really good as well mmm I love the smokiness of the barbecue sauce here at Carl's but honestly the seasoning itself it's kind of giving me like a baked barbecue Lay's type of flavor to it if you've ever had like Lay's chips a lot of that flavor is pretty much similar to what I'm having right now it does taste like that like potato chip barbecue powder not so much a cheeseburger itself but the smokiness of the barbecue and the nice richness of that potato and then it really kind of blends together pretty nicely and then it's enhanced and heightened by the actual barbecue sauce itself as it should be as I'm getting pelted from outside debris from the trees that was just perfect timing let's just keep going with it that's crazy these are good all right let's finish this one out with a nice close-up shot of one of these fries and as you can see the dusting is pretty decent like I said guys they are very nicely coated but the dusting itself does kind of remind me of barbecue Lay's potato chips I mean it's not a bad flavor but I'm not really getting cheeseburger from it but they are very very tasty all right so let's just get right down to it the triple western bacon cheeseburger here at Carl's jr. is gonna get the obvious 10 out of 10 there is nothing wrong with that burger as far as I'm concerned and it's an iconic classic for a reason here at Carl's jr. and it's easily one of my favorites I mean I did review it not that long ago as well which you can actually check out in the upper right hand corner ever display if you want to get an even more in-depth look on that burger but truth be told three patties is really really a crazy situation and honestly I do think it's actually much bigger than the Godzilla thick burger in Mexico strictly because of the onion rings so if you're a fan of the Western bacon cheeseburger in general and you've got the appetite the triple is now on the menu and man it's a glorious situation but when it comes to the western fries things are just a little bit different in that category for me at least and it's not so much based upon the flavor of what they are it's the actual price point for what you're getting and guys I have to be honest for $3.99 this is pretty small it really wasn't a lot in the box as you guys probably saw and you can up sized your combo to actually accommodate this but all you're really doing with that is swapping out the regular fries for this for four bucks so honestly I like the flavor it's not so much a cheeseburger itself as it is more of like a heightened type of barbecue type of seasoning but it's still very tasty and it goes very nicely with the barbecue sauce but four bucks is just a little much for that so overall I'm gonna have to give the western fries here at Carl's jr. Justin okay 7.5 out of 10 and I don't think I'm being too lenient with that because at the end of the day the flavor is just really good I was just wishing for four bucks the quantity was gonna be just a little bit bigger in the past typically with Carl's jr. does is they put their fries in their regular hamburger cartons so it really feels like you're getting just a little bit more for the money and if you want to see what I'm talking about take a look at my Western Crisscuts review that I did not that long ago as well those are the real fries with the Western bacon cheeseburger theme going that I think worked so much better but hey these aren't really too bad just adjust your expectations accordingly which leads me to the very end of this review where I'm gonna ask you are you gonna give this a shot drop some comments down below if you guys have a Carl's jr. in the area how excited are you to give the triple Western bacon cheeseburgers shot if not the Western fries drop those comments down below I'd love to hear what you have to say and with that this is Ian K closing out another episode of peep this out bringing you brand new content every single week here on my channel so while you stay tuned for the next have you coming real soon in the meantime stay frosty man Carl's jr. is really going for it with this new tagline right now flavor lit by fire entering burger nirvana and if you need more proof of it just take a look at the back of his bag I'll read it for you real fast flavor dreams come true charbroiled burgers lit by fire satisfying cravings since always from 100% Angus thickburgers to 100% white meat hand breaded chicken tenders tastebuds blown nuff said very cool bag I have to admit as well alright everyone until next time I'll talk to you soon
