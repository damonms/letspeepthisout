 what's going on everyone welcome or welcome back  to the channel it's Ian K where today i'm over   at taco bell to take a look at their latest promo  that's got a very familiar name but obviously this   one looks just a little different and of course  i'll explain so stay tuned because we're going to   be going in on both versions of this quote-unquote  all-new cantina crispy chicken taco now available   in both chipotle and avocado ranch welcome to  peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty oh taco bell it's old as new again it's gotta be  the longest running joke ever because whenever i   review the new items that you guys have over here  nine times out of ten it's gonna be using six or   seven of the main ingredients that i've always  checked out here over the years and honestly   with the exception of the chicken this is actually  feeling a little new so without further ado feast   your eyes on what they're calling the cantina  crispy chicken tacos over here and honestly the   presentation is looking pretty good guys of course  taco bell goodness that familiar flour tortilla   action but it's what's on the inside that counts  right so let's take a look at what's on the inside   in this case what we've got is a lot of really  tasty taco bell goodness on display for you guys   starting off with the actual chicken itself on  the inside of this warm flour tortilla you're   going to find a tortilla chip coated chicken that  they've had in the past here obviously fried up   to a crispy golden brown and of course it's topped  off with lettuce tomatoes and cheese and with this   version we've got avocado ranch so definitely a  nice combination and the avocado ranch is always a   nice addition to the food over here guys very very  nice on this one for sure moving on to the next   one we've got the exact same ingredients with the  exception of the sauce so of course the tortilla   chip chicken on the inside fried up to a crispy  golden brown once again and naturally topped off   with lettuce tomatoes and cheese and in this case  creamy chipotle sauce for a little bit of kick so   very nice in terms of the presentation guys again  it's very familiar taco bell goodness and like i   said what's old is new again so let's not waste  any more time on these let's get into them yeah   i can't really hate on them too much regardless of  how many times they've recycled these ingredients   but when it comes to the chicken that's really  the newest thing in this because the tortilla   chip chicken that they have on this one is really  something that's actually very special very unique   to taco bell and i've reviewed all versions  of this take a look at that playlist that's   popping up on your screen here right now a lot of  the good stuff from back in the test market days   to all the variations up until right now so very  excited to give this a go let's try the avocado   ranch version first and again really loving the  combination of that goodness on the inside here   we'll go for a couple of bites of each and then  we'll see exactly how new this really is hang on mmm that chicken is the highlight right there yeah that chicken is a major highlight with this  one guys i mean you'd expect that with the outer   coating being tortilla chip based of course with  the light mexican spices and all the stuff that   it's got in general but with the cantina name  i was kind of expecting something along the   lines of the crispy melt taco that they had not  that long ago that cantina crispy melt goodness   a lot of cheesy goodness with that fried outer  shell that was really really tasty but with this   it's cantina in name only but at the same time  very nice in terms of the overall quality of   the chicken and of course with all the stuff  on the inside of this one the avocado ranch   is a pretty amazing situation and all the other  things that you're seeing here with the cheese   the tomatoes the lettuce it's definitely doing  a nice job adding additional flavor overall   but even still with that upscale cantina name  this one is kind of smacking still of a value   menu item so it's got that flare to it even  though the quality of the chicken is better   i see why the premium may be there in terms of  the price but for me this really shouldn't be   above like a buck fifty two bucks tops to be  honest guys because it really does feel like   value menu let's go for one more bite on this  one and of course we'll get into that creamy   chipotle because i really want to get into that  one but this is still pretty tasty guys not bad yeah this is kind of a been there done that  situation right now guys and like i said with   the familiar flavors of taco bell i'm okay with  what i've got here right now aside from the price   being a little bit more than i think it should  be but the quality of what you're getting overall   is pretty tasty i just think this needs to  be just a little less expensive but still   that tortilla chip goodness of the chicken  is really shining on this one not bad   all right and as for the creamy chipotle  variant again a very familiar situation here   as a focus is in lots of creamy chipotle  sauce you can kind of see on the top over   there this one looks like it had a little  bit more across the board of everything so   very excited to give this one a shot let's  see how different it really is hopefully okay well the sauce is different same thing  well just like the other the star of the show   of course is going to be the chicken and in  this case the combination of the chipotle   sauce to go along with that tortilla chip  outer goodness on top of the light spicing   of the chicken itself and again what you've  got here is a pretty solid long chicken tender   essentially with all of that goodness all  the same stuff on the inside of this one   no difference with the exception of the  sauce the creamy chipotle is pretty nice   i still favor the avocado ranch i just think  that's just more of a creamier type of flavor even   though they're calling this one creamy chipotle  it's very nice overall but like i said again   value pricing is what these need to be at guys  this is just a regular taco but again i think i   see the reason why it's up there is because of the  premium of the type of chicken i get that but at   the same time i think taco bell can drop the price  on this one just a little bit so yeah pretty tasty   combination of the goodness the very familiar  goodness that you know over here at taco bell and   again with the quality of the chicken being what  it is that's really the main highlight with this   one i'm really digging the overall presentation  and naturally the creamy chipotle is absolutely   delivering so let's go for one more bite we'll  wrap this review up with the rating coming up   next but guys not bad for what this is although  i do think it's a little bit of a lazy promo   considering this is really nothing special to be  honest guys nothing special at all one more bite well i guess you more or less get what you pay  for and even though this one does feel a little   bit more expensive than it needs to be the quality  is very tasty it's that vintage taco bell flavor   you're getting with all the condiments that are  on this but with that chicken being the premium   highlight of this one for sure that tortilla  chipped outer coating goes pretty nicely with any   of the sauces that you put on this and honestly  guys that really is the standout as it should be   definitely a very tasty item either way  and i am glad to have checked this one out   regardless of the price point order ahead and  pick yours up at our contactless drive-through   all right i know i know i'm really harping on  the price point with this one but guys with   everything going up in price across the board in  every industry out there right now you really got   to come with it if you're going to be charging  anything over 2 or $2.50 for something like that or   at least close to that price point especially for  fast food but still i'm glad to have checked that   out and depending upon your sauce of choice  it's easily something pretty tasty to try and   i have a feeling many of you are going to so  overall i think i'm going to give this one a   double rating because it's really the same product  the only difference is the sauce that you choose   some people may like avocado some people may  like creamy chipotle one better than the other   for me personally i like the ranch but overall  i'm gonna have to give these quote unquote new   cantina crispy chicken tacos over here at taco  bell just an okay 7 out of 10 again it's   all the same stuff that you know and love from  taco bell in this case the return of a fairly   recent new item they've added to the menu every  so often the tortilla chip coating on the outside   of that chicken is pretty amazing and all the  versions i've done in the past it's been the same   this is just another variation of that with some  very familiar sauces but still it's done pretty   well all right so i've got one simple question for  you out of these two versions if you've tried both   of them which is your personal favorite and why  drop those comments down below and definitely   let me know and with that this is Ian K closing  out another high quality foodie feature for you   here on peep this out reviews bringing you brand  new content every single week here on my channel   so while you stay tuned for that next review coming real  soon in the meantime stay frosty yup i can't hate   on you too much taco bell i mean aside from the  price point it's still pretty delicious either   way i just wish i got a little bit more for the  money that's all i'm saying still pretty solid   alright guys until next time i'll talk to you  soon hey thanks for checking out another one of   my reviews but just in case you didn't see the one
