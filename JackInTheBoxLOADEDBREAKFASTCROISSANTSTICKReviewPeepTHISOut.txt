 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty hey everyone I'm back at it this time over a jack-in-the-box to take a look at a pretty tasty looking breakfast snack brought to you by a very familiar name so let's check out the loaded breakfast croissant stick brought to you by the makers of hot pockets and now available here at jack-in-the-box and as expected these are nicely fried I picked up two of these here today guys a buck forty nine a piece from me here on the west coast and I've got one split down the middle let's take a closer look at this year a very nicely fried piece of pastry goodness for sure guys you can see it glistening right there and on the inside looks like we've got some melted cheddar cheese we've got some scrambled egg and some bacon bits are hiding in there as well but I got to admit these are reminding me almost like of egg rolls if these were a little bit more rounder it would be straight-out egg roll and I really like that so let's see what these are working with in the flavor Department it's the loaded breakfast croissant sticks from the makers of hot pockets here at jack-in-the-box let's peep out this flavor yeah this even kind of smells like an egg roll to me right now and I think it has something to do with the flakiness of this pastry dough they're using it's very reminiscent of an egg roll and it's got the same feel as one as well so let's get into this one with first things first if you guys are fans of high-quality delicious looking food reviews make sure to hit that subscribe button down below and don't forget to tap the Bell icon so you can be notified as soon as brand-new content drops every week here we go it's the loaded breakfast croissant stick from the makers of hot pockets here at jack-in-the-box mmm very flaky oh wow that's a lot of tasty filling for sure mmm yeah that egg roll vibe is definitely there and it's primarily because of how thin the pastry is itself there it's nice and crispy nice and crunchy but very flaky with a decent amount of filling on the inside I got a nice bit of cheese on that bite and the egg pieces as well too as you can see right there are pretty decent a little bit of the smokiness from the bacon as well but guys I got to be honest I almost wish these were just a little bit thicker a little bit wider and honestly a little bit more like the old-school Pillsbury toaster strudel style back in the day but these are really really tasty I get they're supposed to be sticks but these are very hearty even after that I first bite I'm like wow this is pretty tasty keep going mmm cheese is rich I like that yeah one of these is not gonna last and I'm glad that I got two mmm let me grab the second half here I am really digging the quality of the flavor and like I said it's very reminiscent of those pillsbury toaster strudels back in the day to breakfast versions a little bits of the egg to cheese a little bit of the bacon bits as well pretty much exactly like that but just a little bit clumped together and stretched out and naturally with the pastry being much closer to an egg roll I like that because it's crispy I get that it's from hot pockets but it really doesn't remind me like I said of a regular hot pocket because that dough is a little bit thicker but I like the quality of this guy's it actually is really tasty mmm yeah these are pretty tasty but on the real you want to make sure you get at least two of these guys because they're a minimum four biter apiece and they're gonna go very quickly I think you're gonna like the flavor of these it's got all that familiar breakfast flavor from the eggs the cheese a little bit of the smokiness of the bacon to go with but overall you really want at least two and it's not a bad deal especially if you can get him a dollar a piece here on the west coast they're a buck fifty each I would still rock a couple of these they're pretty good yeah this one is almost begging to be a little bit larger overall I would be so down with a pop tart version of something like this and again it would be much closer to the Pillsbury version back in the day but as it stands for these being sticks and they're portable they're breakfast definitely tasty guys and pretty hearty as well not bad so with that said I'm gonna have to give the loaded breakfast croissant sticks from the makers of hot pockets here at jack-in-the-box a pretty rock-solid 8 out of 10 and guys like I said if these were just a little bit wider it would definitely be even that much more heartier because on their own they do deliver the flavor is pretty good give this one a shot if you're rushed to go in the morning and you're gonna like these a lot now of course the obvious question is are you gonna give these a shot first things first though are you a fan of hot pockets in general because it's a pretty big name and secondly if you remember the Pillsbury toaster strudel breakfast versions back in the day what did you think of those overall drop those comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K closing out another episode of peep this out bringing you brand-new content every single week here
