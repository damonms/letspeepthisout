 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty hey everyone welcome back to another high quality  foodie feature for you here on the channel where   this time i'm back on over at chick-fil-a because  just as valentine's day is right around the corner   i'm bringing together two menu favorites that look  like they're absolutely meant to be together and   you know what we're gonna kick the heat up on them  a bit too so without further ado and because you   obviously know what's coming feast your eyes  on the buffalo chicken mac and cheese here at   chick-fil-a the combination of their awesome mac  and cheese and the chick-fil-a nuggets kicked up   with some buffalo sauce all throughout and i  gotta say this is definitely a match made in   heaven perfect for valentine's day and i gotta  admit i am digging how this looks already so as   you're about to see on this one the prep is pretty  easy you're pretty much going to take the standard   mac and cheese which features their awesome  parmesan cheddar and romano cheese blend and   of course it's topped off with that baked crispy  crust on top and you're going to mix it up with   a decent amount of the zesty buffalo sauce to go  with here topping it off we've got the chick-fil-a   nuggets basically the boneless chicken breast  pieces that you know and love freshly breaded   and pressure cooked in 100% refined peanut oil so  of course that classic flavor is gonna be there   and then we're gonna drizzle just a little bit of  that buffalo sauce on the very top of that there   guys but definitely a lovely situation in the  presentation and again i'm really digging the   accent of the buffalo sauce on the very top of the  nuggets there and of course it's all throughout   the actual mac and cheese itself guys this looks  and smells pretty delicious right now i love mac   and cheese you guys know it's one of my all-time  favorite foods but with chicken nuggets on top   of it and buffalo sauce i'm expecting a little  bit of heat perfect for valentine's day right   all right let's not waste any more time with  this one let's get into it i'm gonna lift one   of these pieces up here very very thick and i've  got plenty of buffalo sauce all throughout here   guys look at that try and keep that focus  for you lovely situation here we go it is   the buffalo chicken mac and cheese very easy  to make over here at chick-fil-a let's do it whoa flavor overload man i'm getting  the rush of flavor with this is crazy   my mouth is watering from the buffalo sauce heavy  on the vinegar heavy on the flavor but the cheese   the thickness of the cheese oh my god this is  insane why i waited to do this i do not know   this is so good as much as i'm digging the  chick-fil-a nugget guys the mac and cheese   is so bomb over here take a look at that nice  and gooey it is very thick those romano cheeses   the blend it's very very tart very strong banging and yes i just lost a noodle but that's  cool because i am digging this right now   but guys the buffalo sauce is crazy strong on this  one packet is all you really need on it and again   very very flavorful the fact that they don't give  you this as an option to get when you get the mac   and cheese i really don't know they really need  to actually have this available i think as any of   the entrees if you want to get some of the sauces  but wow that buffalo goes amazing with this like i   said the strong cheese flavor the heavy vinegar  the buffalo this is just banging really banging and that crispy crunchy crust on this as well  definitely lights this one up and sets the tone   because you're getting some of the extra cheesy  crunchies to go with the chicken which is awesome   and speaking of the chicken let me just bring  up one of these here for you these nugs are   definitely thick a little on the small side but  at the same time really really coated nicely with   that cheesy goodness in there let me see if i can  give you a cross-section shot of the inside of one solid chicken breast that is nice hormone free  check that out get that focused in antibiotic   free chicken the real deal lightly breaded  freshly breaded in store and then pressure   cooked like i was saying earlier 100% refined  peanut oil but guys the extra cheesiness on these   really adds because it's so rich you guys already  know chick-fil-a has some bomb mac and cheese   i reviewed it when it first came out take a look  at the review popping up on your screen right now   that was a lovely situation my mouth  is watering let me keep going in   wow chick-fil-a has some of the richest mac  and cheese in the fast food game right now this   combination this special blend of these cheeses  here let me try and get that focused in for you   parmesan cheddar and romano and those crunchy  crispy goodies to go with it here on the very top   they bake it they make it fresh it goes amazing  with buffalo sauce this is a very easy combination   and i'm telling you guys well worth your time  well worth the money for this one as well   mmm smooth creamy man gets you right in the very  back as well the buffalo is thick almost like a   ranchy type of buffalo but it's elevated really  really tasty you know i remember seeing this   hack a while back and i always said to myself  i do want to give this a shot at some point so   today is obviously the day and i think it's  perfect timing right around valentine's day   the pairing of two favorites bringing the heat  between these two together with some buffalo   sauce after all but guys a lovely situation on  this and as you can see again i'm just going to   kind of keep showing you as much as i can here  a lovely situation of goodness like i said it is   worth the money a little on the expensive side  i think it was about $4.55 or so for the nuggets   and about $3.79 or so for the medium mac and cheese  so you're looking at close to nine dollars plus   for this little combination but it's very dense  very thick and guys if you like mac and cheese   which i think most of you do if you've made  it this far in you already know what to expect   it's well worth your time because it's so rich and  creamy and it goes amazing with this just awesome   man alright let me give you one last look at  this one before we get into the rating coming   up here guys but as you can see a lovely  situation indeed and as you can see a very   very decent amount of the goodness on the inside  of this container guys it is dense like i said   it really is the way to go and considering you get  eight nuggets on the inside of the pack when you   get the nuggets here at chick-fil-a you can always  put in more i wouldn't go much above one container   of the zesty buffalo sauce a little goes a long  way but you do get a decent amount and it covers   everything pretty nicely on the inside but guys  beautiful flavor and like i said the combination   of these two together a match made in heaven an  easy recommendation definitely give this one a go   all right so i have a feeling i think you know  it's coming right now guys i mean come on it's   inevitable on that scale of 1 to 10 i'm gonna  have to give the buffalo chicken mac and cheese   here at chick-fil-a a rock solid 10 out of 10 how  could i not i mean the combination of that chicken   with the three types of cheeses and that mac  and cheese goes beautifully together guys   parmesan cheddar and romano is  very tart very tangy very rich   and overall the denseness of everything  together with that chicken was a beautiful   situation and it's really set off  beautifully with the heat from the   zesty buffalo sauce a banging combination and  perfect for valentine's day the heat is real   okay so i gotta ask you now do you guys personally  think this is something that you'd like to try   drop some comments down below this has been  available online a lot of people are hacking these   two together and adding that buffalo sauce and i  was very curious to give this one a go but what do   you personally think about this one drop those  comments down below and definitely let me know   and with that
