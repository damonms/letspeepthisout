 what's going on everyone and welcome back to  another high quality foodie feature for you   here on the channel cheaters cam style  after hours over at pizza hut this time   to check out a new flavor available for  the traditional as well as boneless wings   that's right you already know it's sweet  chili so stay tuned because it's up next   welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty so here we are at pizza hut or shall i say  wing street considering the marketing of   this death star looking dome we're  about to get into here guys i have   to admit i really like the packaging that  these wings come in it looks really cool   so let's pop the top of said dome and take a look  underneath and what you're going to find are   8 boneless wings drenched in a sweet chili wing  sauce and i have to admit the aroma is permeating   around my car pretty nicely as well as stinging  the insides of my nose you can definitely smell   the chili in this one guys it's pretty strong and  it's definitely smelling pretty sweet too but i   have to admit all of that sauce is hugging  these boneless nugs pretty nicely guys and   they are definitely chicken nuggets guys i don't  know about wings but they do look pretty sizable   definitely coated up fried to a crispy golden  brown with 100% white meat on the inside and again   lots of saucy goodness and of course this dome  allows that because you can really shake it up   definitely pretty nice on this one for dipping  of course we've got the old standby my favorite   ranch so we're definitely gonna get into that  but guys again the crispiness of these nuggs   they do look pretty awesome and i have to admit  with the smell of that sweet chili in the air   i think i'm in for a little bit of heat with this  one so this is the all-new sweet chili flavor on   top of some of their boneless nuggs aka wings  here at pizza hut let's peep out this flavor   nuggs wings whatever you call it it's definitely  some crispy chicken goodness guys and as you can   see a very plentiful amount eight pieces of the  goodness on the inside of this dome and actually   i like the packaging i gotta tell you guys  it really is pretty cool because it allows   you to kind of shake it up shake shake shake  a little bit back and forth just to make sure   they are all nicely coated and i got to tell you  guys the aroma in my car right now is absolutely   lit up so let's get a little bit more coated  action on this one here and as you guys can see   a lovely situation it doesn't look too different  right i mean it's pretty even across the board   in terms of the amount of that sweet chili sauce  let's give this a shot guys i'm very excited to   give this a go man it's already stinging my nose  so you know what let's go for this big chunk right   over here there's a lot of saucy goodness on this  one hang on one second there we go take a look   at that saucy action sweet chili this wing sauce  is definitely strong here we go guys let's do it oh that is sickly sweet there comes the heat that's not bad actually  the sizzle is good pretty even across the board   and then it kind of falls back into the cut with  more of that sweetness but the crispiness of the   chicken is actually really nice guys take a look  at that definitely a lovely situation in terms of   this chicken nugg here right now again your mileage  may vary wings nuggs whatever you want to call it mmm that's really good i like this  one it's sickly sweet though that's   the only thing i think the ranch is  going to help this one just a bit but   it'll help cut some of that i like it nice quality  on this filming at night it's always a little bit   of a challenge with the lighting especially when  you have white meat chicken because it's trying   to focus on the contrastiness of it but as you  can see the contrast between what you're seeing   with the sauce and the chicken it's a pretty  nice representation right there guys you can   really see little chili flakes in there and it's  sauced up beautifully it's just very very sweet   but overall you're getting a decent amount and  these nuggs actually look pretty good in the bowl   pretty nice on this one guys pretty nice indeed  but still very very sweet and even though i'm not   really a fan of that the quality and the flavor  is very good so guys we're gonna get into some   ranch sauce here because i really think it needs  it let's give this one a shot here and if anything   it's gonna kind of cool it down it's not a crazy  amount of sizzle but it's definitely got a little   bit of heat there which is a good thing because  it's supposed to be sweet heat right it's just   overly sweet that's the only thing so as i'm about  to lose one of these nuggs here right now let's   give this a go take a look at that we'll try and  keep it focused as much as possible there you go   and i think this is going to be a lovely situation  definitely a nice size of the container it really   kind of helps get all of the nugg in here as well  you're not really hitting the sides back and forth   here this is actually pretty nice i'm going to  give this a shot this is looking really good oh yeah creaminess of the ranch light  tartness of it instantly cuts the sugar   but a little bit of sizzle coming in that's  a nice combination i'd almost want to kind   of pour the ranch into the whole bowl shake it  up and go for that because that would be pretty   nice i think visually but only because we want  to keep the composure of what we've got here   very very nice i'll try and keep that  focus as much as possible for you again   a little bit of a challenge  but i'm up for it let's do it oh yeah very tasty with ranch absolutely  i mean of course it is right it's ranch   you know i gotta say i'm having a pretty nice  experience with this one right now guys and i   think that's primarily because the last couple  of times i've tried the wings over here i think   they've kind of been a little hit or miss with  me i think it was the nashville hot wings and   the smoky sriracha that i did back in the day  as well and those reviews can be found on the   pizza hub playlist here on the channel but guys  the quality of this is really nice and again   i am really digging that death star dome that  these things come in here they it's just a   really cool thing to be able to kind of shake it  up and really give it a go and again the marketing   is pretty slick on this i mean i really like the  embossed wing street that it has a cross over here   this is just looking really really cool and of  course they've got their logo on the very top but   again it's all about the sauce with this one here  and for me while it is very very sweet on its own   the ranch completely elevates it there so on its  own again very very sweet but what you're getting   is a decent amount of heat at the same time here  so it's got a nice little bit of sizzle it's not   really overbearing but it hangs out for a bit and  as i'm talking right now i can feel the whole back   of my mouth my throat's lit up with it but it's  pleasurable believe it or not it's actually not   bad but and there's always a but right it's all  about the ranch action here so let's go for one   more on this one and i got to say guys i'm glad  i'm checking this out at night as i'm trying to   keep the focus for you come on lock in lock in  this is really really good and again ranch really   elevates this one up here so we'll go for another  couple of bites on this one just to finish this   out and then we'll wrap the review up here but  again a lovely situation with ranch and i would   highly recommend getting it because depending  upon your level of sweetness it could be a little   bit up there for you for me it is and i'm really  glad that i've got ranch on the side pretty good definitely definitely and because i said  two bites let's just finish it out guys   one more quick one and we'll get this one drenched  up very nicely again a little bit of a focus issue   right there hopefully that's holding its own but  as you can see delicious either way let's do it yes sir this new sweet chili flavor on top  of these boneless nuggs aka wings really   does a nice job of emulating exactly what you're  expecting with this one guys it's sweet with heat   but again very much elevated in the sweetness  factor what you're getting on top of the white   meat that's coated up and fried to a crispy golden  brown is a lot of sugary goodness with some heat   mixed into it but it still it really does hold  its own in terms of flavor and the quality of the   nuggs themselves this time out gotta say is very  cool just a little on the sweet side on its own   so with everything you've seen and heard in this  review up until now i'm gonna have to give the   sweet chili boneless nuggs aka wings here at pizza  hut a pretty solid 8.2 out of 10 with the ranch   it's well over 9 guys but on its own like i  said it's sickly sweet at least in my opinion the   quality of the chicken overall is really holding  its own and i think that's helped along with the   sauce that soaks up into the coating and that's  always a beautiful thing because a sticky sauce   you really want something to get into the nooks  and crannies again the quality of the heat is   pretty decent it's nothing crazy over the top but  like i said the sugar level is just a little up   there so definitely get a sauce to dip into and  for me personally that ranch was beautiful it cut   everything completely in half and you can really  taste everything very nice and of course the   tartness and the creaminess of ranch goes amazing  with it in addition to the light heat that still   kind of sticks around so pretty nice quality on  this one guys pretty decent all right so do me a   quick favor drop some comments down below let me  know if you've given the sweet chili a shot over   here at pizza hut and if you did give it a go did  you actually prefer it on the boneless wings or   the bone-in wings drop those comments down below  and definitely let me know and with that this is   Ian K closing out another high quality foodie  feature for you here on peep this out reviews   cheaters cam style after hours bringing you brand  new content every single week here on my channel   so while you stay tuned for
