peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty so here we go with dave's triple and as the light shines through and what's looking like a beautiful situation I am already digging what I'm checking out here already guys take a look at this monstrosity of deliciousness starting off at the very bottom over here we got three quarter-pound patties stacked up nicely let's just start from top to bottom and we'll definitely get there a very soft situation on that bun of course let's take a look on the inside we've got some light Mayo some ketchup some pickles looks like we've got some raw onion tomato lettuce and guys underneath it is the star of the show let me try and lift this up ooh lots of gooey cheese right there 3/4 pound patties of beef I got to say guys lovely lovely goodness right here looking amazing super tall let's go a little further in get a little bit more that cheese pull action right there man there is no shortage of deliciousness on deck here we're going down one more time man I can barely peel this one together there's more cheese all over the place here guys looking really really good really glad to finally scratch this went off that burger bucket list it looks amazing a classic burger here at Wendy's done in triple form let's go in and see if the flavor is going to deliver how could it possibly not it's the Dave's triple here at Wendy's let's peep out this flavor oh yeah I was definitely looking forward to checking this one out after the triple Baconator that I did recently because honestly this is really the only other triple variant burger that Wendy's offers on their menus so considering what this is guys again look at how crazy insane that is right there that is literally almost a pound of beef 3/4 of a pound to be exact before cooking with all the veggies on top right there no bacon obviously but obviously a very big cheeseburger nonetheless so I can't wait to get into this right now but real quick like always before I do just that you guys are fans of high-quality delicious looking food reviews make sure to hit that subscribe button down below and don't forget to tap that Bell icon so you could be notified as soon as brand-new content drops every week guys the Dave's triple looking amazing let's go for it hmmm man beefy already you knew that though right mmm juicy that is straight up a block of meat and cheese goodness right there guys and honestly just holding this in my hand when I first picked this one up is a lovely situation in and of itself because of how thick everything is on this one just like that triple Baconator which if you guys haven't checked that one out take a look at that review popping up on your screen right now it is exactly like that but with the fresh goodies on the very top let me see if I can get a little bit of those with the next bite oh man that is beyond insane with that light ketchup and mayo combination right there and again I'm not really a fan of mayo so I'm getting a light little sweetness from the ketchup itself but even a tomato I'm not really tasting because like I said this is literally a block of meat and cheese and this is the only reason you'd want to get this is for that very reason alone delicious stuff the patties are very fresh very hot and the melty goodness of that cheese it's off the chain guys as you know I can barely keep up with this right now because it's so pasty with all the flavor in my mouth right now in a very good way let me just tell you let's go for another bite we're go for another couple with this one but guys it's delicious you knew it was gonna be let's do it oh I am so down with these huge burgers right now and again with all that cheesy gooey goodness in the middle right there kind of keeping it all together it's a beautiful thing the flavor of the cheese is very dense and I'm really diggin that but it's nice to know the veggies on top are definitely holding their own as well the crunch of the onions and the pickles on the very top there as you guys can see it's not really doing too much to the overall flavor I'm getting little hints of it because there's just so much meat here but as you can see guys a beautiful situation so let me go 360 since I've got this up for you it is really really awesome 3/4 of a pound of fresh never frozen beef before cooking and really just a nice showcase of the meat and cheese that they do very well over here at Wendy's definitely a bomb situation I'm gonna go for one more bite of this and then we'll wrap this one up after the rating but guys super delicious or more bite let's do it hmmm so yes a definite appetite destroyer over here at Wendy's and let me just also say if you're watching this after midnight right now please accept my humble apologies as always definitely run on over to Wendy's and give this one a shot this triple is a beautiful situation and is worthy of trying right now I'm so glad to add this to my Wendy's playlist because it's gonna go very nicely with that triple Baconator this is really the one-two punch of what they do amazingly well over here Wendy's in very gargantuan fashion I might add very tasty so let's not waste any more time on this one guys the Dave's triple over here at Wendy's is gonna get the obvious 10 out of 10 there is really nothing wrong with this burger whatsoever the fact that it doesn't have bacon is not deterring from the fact that the overall flavor is delivering on its own anyway and honestly it's not meant to have bacon that's really just the classic cheeseburger done in triple fashion and I got to say even the double is decent this triple is literally gluttonous overload I would easily do it again because once in a while you got to go in on something like that it is just too delicious not to and I'm so glad to finally do it here on the channel alright so what I'm gonna ask you right now is pretty simple if you're a fan of Wendy's in general you've probably tried the Dave single or the double anyway is the triple something you think you'd probably want to go in on drop those comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K closing out another episode of peep this out bringing you brand new content every single week here on my channel so while you stay tuned for that next review coming real soon in the meantime stay frosty dang Wendy's even at about half eaten right now this actually still feels like a Dave's double just by itself this is still pretty thick alright guys until next time I'll talk to ya soon but hey real quick before you go and just in case you haven't already take a look at the last review that I put out right up over here along with what I think YouTube's gonna recommend for you to check out as well as always I think
