 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty hey everyone welcome back to another high quality  foodie feature for you here on the channel   cheaters cam style after hours once more over a  good old bk to go in on yet another variation of   their all-new hand-breaded chicken sandwiches so  let's do just that here we go with their all-new   deluxe spicy hand breaded chicken sandwich here at  bk and already this is looking very familiar guys   although i have to admit the chicken is looking a  little on the small side this time so let's break   this one down from top to bottom and as you're  going to see that familiar potato bun is there   and once we pop it it looks like we've got plenty  of that savory sauce and lots of chopped lettuce   this time out guys and while i definitely would  have preferred a slice of leaf lettuce that's   not how they roll over here at bk but even still  as you're going to see as we pan down we've got a   single slice of tomato a little on the small side  again but once we look underneath that guys the   chicken is a little on the small side this time  what we've got there is a hand breaded white meat   chicken breast and it's definitely looking pretty  crunchy as it appears to have a decent amount of   that spicy glaze giving it a little bit of that  red tinge but again this piece of chicken that   i'm looking at here is a little on the small  side underneath it though looks like we've got   plenty of that spicy glaze on the bottom and of  course more of that savory sauce but guys i'm a   little discouraged by the fact that the chicken  is a little inconsistent this time it is what it   is what can you do but hey let's just see if the  flavor is going to deliver on this one this is the   all new deluxe spicy hand breaded chicken sandwich  here at bk let's peep out this flavor yeah the   chicken's looking a little anemic this time out  guys but the crispiness is absolutely on point as   is that spicy glaze as you can see right there it  really does present pretty nicely although i wish   it was just a little bit bigger kind of like the  previous two reviews that i did but hey it is what   it is so let's get this one going guys i'm very  curious to see if that spicy glaze is gonna help   drown out any flavor that this tomato is hopefully  not going to add too much of on top of everything   else here here we go it's the all new deluxe  spicy hand breaded chicken sandwich here at bk hmm hold on i thought the tomato was trying to  give me the business real quick but actually   the spicy glaze is doing a beautiful job of  masking it guys it's got a very nice kind of   sweet type of flavor and then the heat's beginning  to build up right now but guys the chicken itself   as you saw is a little on the small side let's  go for another bite we'll give you a close-up   but so far it's what i expected just a little  bit smaller this time let's keep going in yeah that spicy glaze is a banger of a sauce  to add to these hand breaded chicken sandwiches   and i'm so glad it's the standard going forward  and it really is an awesome variation here again i   only wish the chicken itself was a little on the  thicker side it seems about half of what it should   be and even with the addition of the tomato and  the lettuce that's actually adding a little bit   of crunch overall but guys this really is the same  sandwich with a little bit of extra crunch because   of that but the sauce is drowning out any flavor  of those two additions even still very delicious   i just love when you bite down into this one it  really feels distinctly different compared to all   the other chicken sandwiches that i've reviewed  here in the past and truth be told i have a   feeling we're going to see all those sandwiches  that came out back in the day reintroduced again   with this variation of the hand breaded goodness  that this is because guys i'm already looking   forward to a chicken parm version with this with  the hand breaded chicken maybe a rodeo version   something with bacon on top of it you know bk is  gonna do it eventually and i gotta say this is a   great base to start with hand breaded goodness is  pretty a bomb so let's go for a couple more bites   on this one because like i mentioned earlier  i was concerned about the tomato specifically   with this i'm not so much caring too much about  the lettuce naturally it's the tomato that i was   worried about and thankfully like i said the sauce  is really drowning that out let's keep going in definitely crunchy yeah as i'm getting further  into this right now there's really nothing that   i'm feeling in the very back of the bun it's kind  of beginning to smush together just a bit so what   is left of the chicken here is pretty much in the  middle so a little disappointing for that guys   but as you can see the quality of what you're  getting overall at least with this piece   could be a little bit bigger yes but the flavor  is definitely on point and again that white meat   is definitely good definitely fresh but with this  cut in particular just a little on the small side   and that's a little bit of a shame because the  consistency of what i've been having up to this   point right now has been a little bit up and down  the flavor has been awesome across the board but   the chicken sizes have kind of vary just a little  bit while the classic variant was definitely long   and wide and it covered the bun pretty nicely  it was a lot thicker on the spicy variant and   even though it was a little bit shorter it was  definitely higher much closer to popeye's actually   so this one is literally the runt to the litter  unfortunately and even though the price point's   a little bit more expensive this is $5.99 here in  southern cali right now i feel like this should   be just a little bit less considering what i got  right now at least the flavor is delivering it's   still a delicious chicken sandwich and a great  option to have on the bk menu going forward this   is the standard like i said but like i said  earlier again that spicy glaze is a banging   addition it is so good on this truly all right so  let's go for one more bite in this one then we'll   close it up after the rating guys but i'm so glad  to have given this one a shot to cross this one   off the list so to speak tomato is definitely in  the bag thankfully it's not tasting like tomato   to me right now thankfully that spicy glaze is  doing its job one more bite we'll close it up well let's just go around the world with this  one guys and you can see what i'm talking about   in the very back there is nothing there so  you have a really nice decent potato bun   and again like i usually say with this i'd  love to have some type of flour dusting to   make it a little bit more authentic but guys  at least everything on the inside of this is   singing in that flavor department and again the  quality of that spicy sauce the glaze is just   so awesome on these chicken sandwiches an easy  recommendation to try it just for that alone   but just make sure the piece of chicken that  you get it on is a little bit more sizable   that definitely could have been beefed up  just a little bit so to speak all right so   with that said i'm gonna have to give the deluxe  spicy hand breaded chicken sandwich here at bk   just in okay 7 out of 10 this time quality  wise it's up there guys it's just that what   i got right now is not worth the $5.99 price  point i wish it was just a little bit thicker   there needed to be more meat on that but even  still a very delicious chicken sandwich and again   the spicy glaze is really what adds to it that  is a delicious sauce i can't say it enough it   adds a tasty amount of flavor to what's already  a very tasty piece of chicken in general guys   and a little bit of that heat added extra is just  a bonus on top of it really really good stuff all   right so i gotta ask you out of all the new  chicken sandwiches offered over here at bk   i mean granted it's only two of them just the  classic and the spicy either with lettuce and   tomato or without drop some comments down below  which is your personal favorite out of the four   technically on the menu right now very curious to  hear what you have to say and with that this is   Ian K closing out

tuned for that next review coming  real soon in the meantime stay frosty yeah i   see you bk definitely ultra crispy for sure on  this one i just wish the piece of chicken that   i had tonight was a
