 what's going on everyone and welcome or welcome  back to the channel it's Ian K where today i'm   over a good old papa john's because it looks like  a fan favorite menu item is about to get stuffed   with even more epic goodness that's right and  you already know so stay tuned because the epic   pepperoni stuffed crust pizza is up next welcome  to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty yes sir not only does this look absolutely  epic in terms of the presentation guys it's   epic in terms of weight feast your eyes on  the epic pepperoni stuffed crust pizza from   papa john's and guys again this thing is barely  being held up with one of my hands here right now   a very lovely situation let's break this one down   all right so right off the break what we've got  here is a large one topping pizza featuring their   signature pizza sauce along with more cheese  naturally and your choice of topping and in   this case i thought i'd keep it traditional and  go with pepperoni since that's exactly what's   going to be on the inside of the crust and guys  speaking of the crust that's obviously the main   star of the show and i have a feeling it's going  to deliver because what it consists of is hand   stuffed cheese and pepperoni all throughout  guys and it is loaded absolutely topped off   with a garlic wash as well for even more flavor  and i got to say guys it's very puffy very thick   so yeah i think this is going to complement this  pizza very nicely but just to be on the safe side   of course we've got their special garlic dipping  sauce my all-time favorite that we're going to   dip into with this because guys it's papa john's  you got to do that but again presentation wise   it's looking pretty awesome a solid amount of  pepperoni on the top of this one and again that   crust i cannot wait to get into so let's not waste  any more time on this one let's do just that this   is the all-new epic pepperoni stuffed crust pizza  from papa john's let's peep out this flavor   yes sir i do love me some pizza and this is definitely  my favorite food for sure guys and as you can see   that crust in the very front of your screen right  there is very very thick so like always pizza is   usually a challenge to film in the car let me just  put this down real fast and we're gonna pull up   a slice here real quick and wow this feels like  a very heavy and very floppy slice and guys let   me just show this to you here take a look at all  the pepperoni action it's a semi-rainy day here   in southern cali so excuse the contrastiness of it  but as you can see there is plenty of cheese look   at that crust in the very back loaded with that  cheese blend action and some pepperoni lining it   as well but guys i thought i'd keep it traditional  like i said classic papa john's goodness here   semi toasty on the bottom it's feeling pretty  nice but again the very back of this is very   thick like a massive breadstick so let me get  into the pizza real quick of course we're gonna   get into the very back of this right after that  but guys let me just taste this hang on one second   it's the all-new epic pepperoni stuffed crust  pizza here at papa john's let's peep this out i love pizza so good   that classic papa john's goodness and with the  pepperoni being what it is as well even though   it's not my all-time favorite topping it goes very  nicely a little bit of the light heat that i'm   getting from these peps guys it's actually really  really good but the cheese blend the signature   sauce a very lovely situation indeed let's  go for another quick bite on this one hang on no well maybe three mini bites  because guys it's super delicious   so like i said at the top of this one it's  usually a challenge to film pizza in the car   because of the size of it but when it looks as  beautiful as this up close it is totally worth   the effort and as you can see i'm really digging  the light crispiness of the pepperonis they're   cupped up just a little bit there on a few of  them but the quality is nice guys the quality   of the pizza sauce and the cheese in general  a very lovely situation but this is the real   reason that we're here to see exactly how that  dovetails into the cheese in the back of the crust   along with that pepperoni so let's do  just that so yeah definitely epic in the   presentation along with the size of this crust  in the very back here we go guys let's do it thick and doughy pepperoni action with the cheese  mmm that's a nice combo oh yeah you know i just   took out one of the pepperonis in the back of the  crust here and i think depending upon the slices   that i've got here there's about maybe four or  five pepperonis along with it the way they cut it   but guys the garlic goodness that i'm getting  with that wash in the very back along with the   cheese on the inside and of course the pepperoni  you can kind of see there on the very bottom   is a very lovely combination there it's a small  upgrade but it delivers large flavor across the   board and i have to say again the combination  of the garlic wash along with the crust and of   course the cheesy goodness with the pepperoni  guys this is very delicious it really is so i   guess depending upon how you're biting into this  you can literally take out one pepperoni per bite   as you go depending upon the slices naturally  but guys pretty awesome let's keep going in yeah well it looks like i took out half of  a pepperoni in that bite so this is going   to be a little bit of a better representation  of that cross section and as you can see guys   lots of meaty goodness cheesy goodness to go  with just very gluttonous very delicious very   flavorful across the board very very nice you  know i gotta say the further i get into this the   heartier this is beginning to feel and believe it  or not this is an upgrade over the little caesars   variant from back in the day which you're probably  seeing jumping up on your screen here right now   their pepperoni and cheese stuffed crust pizza  was pretty good as well but what i'm feeling i'm   getting with this one is thicker bread in the back  it feels more substantial across the board and   guys you can kind of see that it's not just the  close-ups that i did earlier but look at that it's   very puffy very thick and it's got just a lot more  going on so i'm totally digging this absolutely   right now and as much as i'm enjoying this  right now you know it's about to go next level   guys because we're about to dip into some of their  awesome special garlic dipping sauce this stuff is   absolutely amazing so i can only imagine what it's  going to be like you're not going to have to wait   too long let's get into this oh yeah the goodness  right there oh that smell is heavenly here we go   it's a little bit of a flop around this slice  here but let's go for a dip let that focus in   and we are definitely lighting this  up guys very gluttonous just look at   that very gluttonous let's do this i am super  excited it's gonna be epic i already know it oh oh let the hearts rain down on me  right now please mmm they probably are wow   wow hold please let me go for a quick bite  in the front i'm gonna chase it oh my god mmm my god pure heaven right now pure heaven you know  i gotta say i am pretty much getting full off of   this one slice right now epic in flavor epic  in size epic in appetite destroying and when   you add this action to go with guys let's go in  again this is crazy ridiculous oh god that is very   gluttonous on a semi-rainy day pizza on top of it  something like this as well let's do it hang on oh my god yeah this is beyond insane guys it's a  small upgrade in terms of what they're adding to   the back but it adds so much flavor overall on top  of the pepperoni that you're getting on the pizza   this is really really delicious so let's  go for another quick bite on this one but   guys let me show you one more time plenty of  cheese in the very back and i gotta say the   pepperoni edition added to it is a very lovely  situation absolutely digging this guys and again   super super delicious let's just  go for one more little quickie bite   i'm gonna give you another close-up shot to round  out the review with the rating coming up next   with a fresh slice because this one is kind of  mangled let's just go for that last bite hang on all right so here we go with some lovely  pepperoni oil right there in your face guys   a lovely situation indeed but of course the  star of the show on the very back of this one   that garlic wash on top of the crust loaded  with the cheese and the pepperoni on the inside   a very lovely upgrade across the board and again  it goes amazing with that garlic dipping sauce   beautiful stuff all around and price point wise  you can't really fade it for one topping $13.99   and it's a lot of food like i said earlier i'm  pretty much full off of one slice very delicious   better ingredients better pizza papa john's well  i gotta say a pretty decent upgrade over the   original epic stuffed crust pizza that i reviewed  when it first came out guys and like i said it's   not just stuffed crust pizza it's papa john's  crust stuffed and this one definitely is stuffed   with the goodness that pepperoni really adds a lot  to this one very delicious in terms of the flavor   and the size so with that said i'm going to have  to give the all-new epic pepperoni stuffed crust   pizza here at papa john's the obvious 10 out  of 10 guys there's really nothing wrong with   this whatsoever it was made very well it was  loaded with cheese and pepperoni in the back   and overall very satisfying on top of that special  garlic dipping sauce that really is the highlight   i absolutely love that stuff and this was a blast  to check out right now very delicious i'd highly   recommend it all right so i have a feeling if  you've made it this far
