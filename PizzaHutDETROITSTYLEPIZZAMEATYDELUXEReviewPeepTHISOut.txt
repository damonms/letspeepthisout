 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty hey everyone welcome to another high quality  foodie feature for you here on the channel where   this time i'm back on over a pizza hut because  after checking out their all new detroit style   pizza recently a bunch of you wanted me to  swing on back to try another variation of it   so without further ado let's go in on the all-new  detroit meaty deluxe and already i'm loving what   i'm seeing here guys of course we're going to  be greeted by that vine ripened tomato sauce in   the very top as you can see it's stripped down  on either side of the pizza but what it's on is   actually what i'm really interested in we've got  pepperoni we've got crispy cup pepperoni to go   with that bacon and sausage and of course there's  50% more cheese from edge to edge on this one so   you know it's all going to be about that goodness  right there guys on top of the fact that we've   got the light and airy deep dish crust to go with  with the caramelized cheesy edges i got to admit   i'm really digging how toasty these look right  now and i can't wait to get into this so yeah   a lovely situation with those caramelized cheesy  edges staring you in the face right now guys and   honestly this is going to be a little bit more of  an addendum to my last review because like i said   at the end of that one i was really hoping there  was like a full sausage variant of these available   naturally the closest i'm going to get to it is  the meaty deluxe so we're going to definitely do   that right now and of course you already know this  is just an excuse to get this pizza again right   because i really enjoyed it the last time out so  because pizza is always difficult to do in the car   i'm very thankful again this is a square shaped  box a very lovely situation there let me pull   up one of these pieces we'll get right to it and  already we've got a very cheesy situation here wow   this is very nice guys feast your eyes on that  there the sausage all that stuff there looking   really nice vine ripe and tomato sauce action  for you but with the bacon mixed into this as   well this piece doesn't really seem to have  too much of that but we're going to go a little   further in to see here but again the caramelized  edges all the way around here a lovely situation   let's give this one a shot guys very excited  to go into this again but with a different   topping set here it's the all-new detroit  meaty deluxe pizza at pizza hut let's do it oh yeah lots of cheese and the  richness of that sauce it's so banging   it's tangy it's tart and it was actually hiding  a nice piece of bacon guys it's kind of a smoked   flavor which i'm really liking with this here but  again meaty deluxe name i believe it is warranted   there's a decent amount on here and the cheese  is just really really awesome and again edge   to edge on this guys lovely situation of the  doughy goodness right there on the inside i'm   really digging that and again we're just going to  keep going around trying to give you a bunch of   glory shots with this one here because this pizza  is very photogenic and again the cup pepperoni   action as well definitely digging it the second  time around just as delicious let's keep going in oh man the bacon makes this it really does i'm  glad i did this version and the sausage don't   get me started it's really good as well i wouldn't  be surprised if you actually saw a version of this   in the near future with beyond meat because  they have it on the menu anyway but guys a   very lovely situation with the nice flavor of the  sausage itself and those cup pepperonis an amazing   situation because they're kind of curled up as  well so of course they're delivering but naturally   all the cheese the doughy goodness on this as well  it's just really really great let's keep going in and again the vine ripened tomato sauce a major  highlight that's so delicious on this let me give   you another shot of this one on the inside here  and again guys i can talk more highly about the   sauce on this it really does make it for me  it's got that light tanginess the tartness   that really sets this one off and of course  when you're biting into the doughy goodness   it's got a decent amount of height to it and again  nice and buttery on the bottom i am really loving   that there but of course my topping of choice  sausage that's what i was looking forward to   trying here definitely digging that it complements  those cup pepperonis and the pepperoni in general   but a very lovely situation here let's go  for a couple more bites guys but again i   am definitely digging this i had a feeling i  would considering that topping set really awesome sausage is banging and because why  not i've got this little chunk here   staring me in the face with the cup  pepperoni let's just knock it out loving this so yeah another banging variant of the  all-new detroit style pizza here at pizza hut and   because we're literally at the edge of the review  right now let me give you another edge shot of   those caramelized edges here and try and focus  this in definitely digging what we've got here   guys this is definitely a highlight on top of the  sauce i'm trying to keep that focused in but as   you can see almost like cheese bread here at the  end when you get to it and i have to admit again   i am really loving the butteriness the factor of  it that you're seeing here my fingers are all lit   up with the greasy goodness but i'm really loving  what i got here guys a very very delicious pizza   yeah definitely a delicious pizza and with  the trifecta of toppings or in this case the   quad fecta toppings because there's two types  of pepperoni on that the regular and the cup   as well as the bacon and that sausage guy's  a lovely combination if you're a carnivore   you already know that's what you're going  to want to jump into right now and again   a great showpiece just in general for what  the detroit style is over here at pizza hut   definitely digging the vine ripened tomatoes a  lovely situation there of course you've heard me   talk about it ad nauseam about how tangy and tart  it is it really adds a nice flavor overall and   the richness to the pizza in general is really  on display so i'm really digging this i really   enjoy it i think it's really really delicious and  again i'm glad i came back to give this one a shot   especially because it's got one of my all-time  go-to's for pizza toppings sausage just a lovely   situation in that regard so as if you can't tell  by this point in the review i'm going to have to   give the all-new meaty deluxe detroit style pizza  here at pizza hut a rock solid 10 out of 10 guys   the inclusion of sausage on that instantly was  gonna score with me because the quality of the   sausage is really good but the smokiness of the  bacon on top of it and of course the pepperoni   and everything together really combines to give  you a beautiful pizza eating experience right now   especially if you like the deep dish action that  this one has to offer and those caramelized edges   just a lovely situation in general all right  so the obvious question because you've made it   this far into the review right now so i already  know you're either going to give this one a shot   or you've tried it already what's your favorite  out of the group that's offered with the toppings   on this pizza drop those comments down below and  definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K   closing out another high quality foodie feature  for you here on peep this out reviews bringing   you brand new content every single week here on my  channel so while you stay
