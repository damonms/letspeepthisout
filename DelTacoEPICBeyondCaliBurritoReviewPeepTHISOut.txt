 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty del Taco goes beyond tacos pun intended by now offering beyond meat into all-new burritos and as you already know as the choice for today's review we're going in on the epic Beyond Cali burrito split down the middle right here for you guys so you can take a look a little bit more closely inside what we've got here is a very large oversized tortilla it's a pretty nice size as you can tell by these two halves setup over here we've got that beyond meat goodness on the inside here guys plant-based protein goodness coming primarily from yellow peas we've also got a combination of crinkle-cut fries cool sour cream some guacamole and normally some pico de gallo but obviously I left that out but as you can see it is pretty girthy if I can call it that guys it looks really really thick let me see if I can swing around give you a little bit more of a closer look so you can take a look at that they're a pretty decent amount of the plant-based protein the beyond meat is definitely on display as you can see all the spices in there and that's lighting up my car nicely a very nice aroma in the car right now thanks to those spices there for sure but let's get into this one guys because the size looks good and it absolutely smells fantastic this is the epic beyond Cali burrito featuring the beyond meat goodness here at Del Taco let's peep out this flavor so are you a fan of high quality delicious looking food reviews well if so definitely hit that subscribe button down below don't forget to tap that Bell icon so you could be notified as soon as new content drops every week now let's dive into this one well I don't know about epic just yet but judging by the size of this one at least by the half that I'm holding up here right now it's a little on the small side but it does make up for that by having a decent amount of filling on the inside of this one here guys and what's really standing out for me to start from just the presentation of the beyond me cuz there seems to be a lot of it here again is those spices that are really beginning to kind of permeate around the car so let's give this one a go and give it a shot it's the epic Beyond Cali burrito here at Del Taco mmm oh yeah yesir absolutely more beyond meat is in this burrito compared to the tacos that I reviewed not that long ago which you guys can find my thoughts on right on the upper right hand corner it display here right now nice quality on this one in general but I do have to say it's missing something let me go for one more bite see if I can break it down a little bit further for you but it's tasty don't get me wrong it is pretty tasty mmm well I didn't taste it in the first bite and I'm definitely not tasting in the second bite and I really hope that there's some of it in here but there is no guacamole to speak of here guys what I'm really getting is a lot of the beyond meat mixture as well as those french fries and a little bit of the sour cream that's in there as well what's really missing for me at least initially is a little bit of the flavor the creaminess of that guacamole but what it really needs is some cheese this really needs to have a little bit more cheese in it when you have a burrito I think that she'd be living at the creaminess of the cheese some shredded cheese just some type of cheese to really set this one up considering it's an epic burrito it's missing some key components aside from the guacamole that's supposed to have I'm thinking that it's in here somewhere but guys you need cheese in a burrito it's just my opinion but you need it but that's not to say what is here isn't tasty because it absolutely is and as you can see there are not skimping on the amount of the beyond meat on the inside of this one and I'm very happy about that I wish she just had just a little bit more in the flavor Department of everything else as you can see we've got that mixture of the crinkle-cut fries which I have to admit are a little off to me with a burrito like this for some reason I know it's adding to it when I'm biting into it it's adding more to the burrito because of the size but in terms of flavor it's not really doing too much what is holding this one up is the sour cream itself and of course those bold Mexican spices that I'm getting from the seasoning that they're using on the beyond meat itself your guys it really is pretty tasty just for that reason alone naturally adding pico de gallo to this would definitely add some additional flavor and since it's supposed to come with it in general you guys have that much more to look forward to if you're down with that but for me right now I'm thinking the guacamole may have been essentially left off of this so what I'm really left with is sour cream fries and Beyond meat and believe me that combination is not bad but again I'm really wishing there with some cheese guys I can't keep telling you enough you need to have a little bit of cheese in this just for color just for the creaminess and just I'm expecting it I got to be honest for an epic burrito I need cheese in it I do you know I'm definitely a fan of beyond meat in general and when it's done as well as it is over here at del taco with a mixture of their spices it really is a highlight on the inside of anything really so with this burrito having a lot of it I'm absolutely loving it just like my initial taco review I mentioned that I really wish the texture itself was a little bit firmer it doesn't really feel like ground beef but the flavor is there what's really making up for this in the girth department at least is the fact that there's fries to go with but guys this is a pretty tasty situation I just wish there was some guacamole and of course some cheese it really does speak for itself in the flavor Department it's nice and hey it's supposed to have guacamole if you get this aside from pico de gallo of course so definitely expect that if you give this one a shot or should I say inspect because you want to make sure that it's in there so with that said I'm gonna have to give the epic Beyond Cali burrito here at Del Taco just in OK 7 out of 10 where this one could have really benefited like you've heard me say throughout this review is adding some cheese and guys like I said earlier again the guacamole was pretty non-existent on this one I know I left the pico de gallo off but all I was left with was the beyond meat which was really good sour cream and fries that's pretty much it on the inside of a semi-decent tortilla for a price point that I think is just a little elevated $6.49 for that in my opinion is maybe a dollar or so more than it needs to be and I get there's a premium because of what you have on this one that beyond meat but guys come on anything over five bucks for something like that is a little much but the question is do you agree with me drop some comments down below are you gonna be giving this a shot over here at Del Taco if you've got one in your area and if you've already tried it how delicious was it for you drop those comments down below and definitely let me know
