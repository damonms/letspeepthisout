 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty hey everyone welcome back to another high quality  foodie feature for you here on the channel where   this time i've gone back on over to del taco  because not only is it on and popping with our   all-new barbecue crispy chicken menu it looks like  they've also got it going on with a few variations   of their all new lemonade poppers now available  in a couple of different flavors that's right   and we're going in on both right now feast your  eyes on the all-new peach and blueberry lemonade   poppers and i am already digging the presentation  of this guys because of what's sitting on the very   bottom of these here but starting off with  the peach variant what we've got here is a   very frosty cup of minute made zero sugar lemonade  the name brand good stuff guys and on the inside   and the very bottom you're gonna find peach boba  basically it's fruit juice bursts that are loaded   with peach flavor and essentially they're tapioca  balls they're kind of chewy and i gotta say guys   very decent amount of these for sure and as you  can probably tell the blueberry variants the   exact same thing the same minute made zero sugar  lemonade only in this case we've got the blueberry   boba action to go with and guys i am really  digging the presentation i love how dark they look   really really nice so yeah i am definitely digging  how frosty these look here right now but i gotta   be honest when i was going to the drive-thru to  pick these up i think homeslice who gave me these   actually gave me the wrong straw because this is  a little bit on the small side i'm going to start   off with the peach variant but guys i really love  the fact that it's using name brand minute made   lemonade guys but the zero sugar variant the last  time i did this it was actually i believe it was   sprite and it was cherry burst and i had a mango  variant available as well but guys i love the fact   that they're using zero sugar this time out let  me see if i can try and get some of this with   this little tiny straw i doubt it but i've got a  spoon as you saw in the close-up here let's give   this a shot guys it's the all-new peach lemonade  popper here at del taco let's give it a shot wow i was actually able to get up the straw  with that kind of surprising a little bit of   a struggle though but guys very refreshing ultra  sweet i gotta be honest with this even though it's   zero sugar you'd be hard-pressed to tell me it is  because it really really feels like it's a regular   sugar version but guys i'm really digging  the peach action with this lovely situation they kind of shoot up into my mouth i'm really  surprised they're kind of fitting through here   slightly but you know what let me pop the  top on this because i want to give you a nice   closer look and honestly i think it's going  to be a little bit easier for me to get into   they are definitely loaded with the good stuff  here so what i'm going to try and do as best as   i can for you i'm going to try and show you this  here keep it focused as you can see there you go   we've got nice peach action in here guys and again  they're pretty plentiful i guess they do kind of   fit up that straw but you really got to try but  man it's like a machine gun that kind of hits   you in the very back of the throat you got to be  careful let me try this just on its own real fast   popping goodness those definitely not sugar-free  but i'm definitely digging everything else in here   right now let me just try a little bit more i'm  kind of having this like i'm having like cup of   noodles here actually but guys i'm really digging  the peach flavor definitely sweeter than what i'm   drinking here with the minute maid but i love the fact  that it's name brand quality lemonade on top of it   oh yeah that's really really good super refreshing  and i guess it makes me feel good knowing that   i'm not having as much sugar considering what i  remember from the last time out with the sprite   variant the cherry burst was actually pretty  decent you know i'm trying to remember when this   actually came out about eight months ago because  i believe i did the mango variant on live stream   i'll make sure to put up the livestream replay  playlist on your screen here right now so you   guys can check it there i believe i did it then  but with the variant of this right now with peach   i'm actually digging the flavor and i think it  complements lemon so peach and lemon very very   fruity with this one i think it's really perfect  for springtime and the flavor is pretty awesome definitely pretty awesome on that but like i  mentioned blueberry i am looking forward to guys   this one here has got to be awesome it's  gotta be i mean just look at this already   a very decent amount of these guys  in the very bottom as well it's the   blueberry lemonade popper  let's give this one a shot i'm not able to get anything  up the straw on this one at all   yeah no bueno on that one there let me pop  the top on this one here and we'll just go   soup style i'm improvising here right now because  it is what it is let me grab a few of these up got   some light ice too which is not bad here we go  actually i'll just show this to you real quick   and we'll try and focus that really fast take a  look there let's give it a go the blueberry action this is the one this is the one easily  the peach is actually very very good   it tastes like artificial peach which i  like but the blueberry is a lot richer a   little bit sweeter tasting and guys it goes pretty  amazing with the lemonade pretty awesome on this oh yeah all day long wow that lemonade is amazing this is  probably the best variation of these   that i've tried yet and i believe i've done  them all at this point which is pretty awesome   mmm definitely oh and just so you know aside from  this variation and you probably saw in the window   in the very beginning of the review they've  got a mini shake variation of this on top of it   which is basically their vanilla soft serve but  with the boba action in here as well so you can   choose between peach and blueberry so you're gonna  get a little bit more of a dessert style action to   go with but guys i was very much interested to try  this lemonade because obviously it's name brand on   top of it and i gotta say the flavor is pretty  awesome this blueberry is a banging situation   mmm absolutely absolutely so really not too much  footage to really show you here aside from holding   up a few of these i'm trying to do the best i  can so you guys can check out the quality here   keeping that focus there we go it's moving in  there we go but guys they are pretty nicely sized   and i have to admit even though they're a little  on the smaller side even though they are a nice   size in my opinion anyway they have a lot of  juice on the inside you can really feel them pop   and they go very very nice with everything  so far that i'm having here which is just   light lemonade or zero sugar but  still guys the flavor is awesome   so yeah you really can't hate on this at all and  i think for like $1.59 or so for each one   pretty nice quality for what you're getting guys  and like i said the name brand goodness is really   standing out depending upon your fruit flavor  of choice both of these are pretty excellent   the peach flavor is very vibrant a little more  artificially type of peach but it's still it's   got the flavor that you'll recognize and the  blueberry is just really doing it for me that's   my all favorite at least with this variation of  the poppers currently right now and i'm really   hoping we're going to see some more flavors down  the line because i have a feeling considering   how all out that del taco is going right now  with these maybe we'll see some others down the   road and hopefully not too long from now because  this is pretty much eight months since the first   go-around of this type of drink over here so a  very nice return and a very nice quality of what's   currently out here right now very very solid with  this so let's start off with the peach variant of   these all new lemonade poppers for that one i'm  gonna have to give it a pretty solid  8.5 out of 10 it's super satisfying in terms  of just the flavor overall and like i said the   quality of that lemonade is really standing out  and they advertise it on the poster that way as   well guys so it's the zero sugar it's the real  deal minute maid action with a really really   fun type of flavor with that peach and like i  said those poppers definitely do what they need   to do when you bite into them and there's a very  solid amount of them on the inside of these cups   and as for the blueberry variant of course i'm  going to go a little higher for that one because i   prefer it over the peach variant so with that said  i'm going to have to get the blueberry lemonade   popper here at del taco 9.5 out of 10 and guys like i said this flavor is very   very rich it really is a little bit richer than  the peach and i think it goes really really well   with the lemonade they're both excellent but the  blueberry just stands out above and beyond being   just a little bit sweeter but at the same time it  does complement the overall zero sugar sweetness   of the lemonade i think just a little bit better  that combination for me is a personal favorite   very very good all right so aside from the obvious  question of asking if you're gonna give this one   a go if you've got del taco in the area i've  got one simple question for you which do you   personally prefer blueberry or peach drop those  comments down below and definitely let me know   and with that this is Ian K closing out another  high quality foodie feature for you here on peep   this out reviews bringing you brand new content  every single week here on my channel so while you   stay tuned for that next review coming real soon  in the meantime stay frosty oh hey and if i can   offer one suggestion for you even if you do get  the correct straw these
