 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty hey everyone welcome back to another high  quality foodie feature for you here on the   channel this time over good old carl's jr because  it looks like a classic menu favorites getting   upgraded with a little bit of heat and you  know what as good as that actually looked up   on the window it looks even better in my hands  right now guys feast your eyes on their all new   fiery double famous star a charbroiled situation  for sure guys this is looking pretty fantastic   so starting off with the obvious on this one  underneath the sesame seeded bun we've got a   very decent portion of their new fiery sauce and  that's complemented with a lot of sliced jalapenos   and that's actually all sitting on top of two  charbroiled beef patties guys looking pretty lovely   each separated with two slices of pepper jack  cheese so we've definitely got a melty situation   going on there and underneath that we've got all  the standard goodies here we've got some onions   some lettuce and tomato and underneath that we've  got more of that fiery sauce so i gotta admit guys   this is looking really really tasty and i gotta  say the presentation is definitely a feast for the   eyes guys this looks very close to the picture up  on the window even though it's just a little bit   smaller but i am digging the presentation and the  aroma in my car is definitely classic carl's jr a   lovely situation in that regard all right so let's  peep this out in the flavor department to see if   it's going to deliver this is the all-new fiery  double famous star here at carl's jr here we go wow that sauce has got some sizzle it's definitely  elevated compared to the jalapenos the jalapenos   have a little bit to them as well they're  very distinct in that flavor department   but man my mouth is beginning to water already  the sauce is elevated on a scale of 1 to 10   maybe 7, 7 1/2 no joke guys the  fiery name is warranted let's keep going in yeah yeah there is definitely some elevated  heat with this one and it's not just coming   from those jalapenos like i mentioned guys i want  to say there's some cayenne in this because it is   really elevated and it is really stinging  me as i'm talking right now this is not bad   so of course the accent of the jalapenos is  adding to that because of the pickle flavor   and then when you add in the pepper jack cheese  for creaminess which honestly i don't think is   delivering any flavor because the sauce flavor is  what's overshadowing it there you're getting all   the other goodies with this one here so obviously  the tomato the onions and the lettuce but guys   this is really a showcase for the sauce and man  does it go really well with that charbroiled beef   man talk about upgrading a classic i've  actually had the famous star a bunch of   times over the years in addition to reviewing  the beyond version of it here on the channel   which you guys can find on the playlist  popping up on your screen here right now   in addition to the spicy western bacon  cheeseburger that was another variation   of a classic they kicked up with some heat as  well but believe it or not this sauce completely   kills that as good as that review was and i had a  lot of fun putting it together this one is crazy   in the heat department i am burning up stinging  right now and i'm loving it let's keep going it man the heat is really beautiful in this  and you know what the accent too that   i'm really liking about this is the fact  that the leaf lettuce is so vibrant this   is probably some of the best lettuce i've  had in a very long time over here carl's   it looks like i'm having a salad on the inside of  this burger here right now it's pretty large guys   and it really complements everything else here  color wise it looks great but again the star of   the show is easily going to be the sauce with  this one along with those pickled jalapenos   and again the creaminess of that cheese i'm not  really tasting it i'm just tasting creaminess   but the flavor of everything else is crazy on  this this is really good you know i gotta say   when i unwrapped this one i was really glad there  was the typical burger wrapper on the very back of   this here or the burger diaper as i like to call  it but guys considering the amount of lettuce   that's on this right now i'm really digging the  fact that it's kind of keeping everything together   on top of the cheese keeping everything together  so it's not really necessary even though there's   a lot of sauce on this everything is being held  together beautifully and again those jalapenos   are absolutely banging on this here right now  let me see if i can just pull one out really   fast just to kind of show you they are a nice  thick cut guys i am really look at that look at   the thickness there really really nice and they  complement that sauce let me try it by itself man pickled goodness wow steamy guys that is  really really heated even more so on its own   man that is a concentrated burn don't do that on  your own if you can help it eat it with a sandwich   oh man i don't have anything to drink here  as usual let me go for a quick bite hang on i was trying to absorb that concentrated  burn that is really giving me some problems   right now this is very very hot on its own that  7 1/2 is maybe 8 1/2 no   joke it is very much up there if you want  to talk really fast food ghost pepper   that's reminiscent of what ghost pepper should  be because it's elevated the real ghost pepper   but within fast food right now because it  really is an elevated heat guys it really is   all right so let me go for one more bite of this  one we'll finish this one up after the rating but   guys a lovely situation with the famous star  over here especially in fiery form let's do it yeah you spice heads are gonna dig this one  for sure that sauce is no joke it complements   everything very nicely in the accent of those  jalapenos is almost adding insult to injury   but in a good way because there's extra heat  and extra pickled flavor to go with everything   and when you add that to the awesome flavor of the  charbroiled beef over here at carl's jr you already   know this is going to be a lovely situation even  if the cheese is not quite as flavorful as i would   have liked this little piece falls off the front  there but even still guys a lovely situation man   i can't remember the last time i had a burger this  hot from carl's jr it probably like maybe the el   diablo burger from back in the day which again  you can find in that playlist in the upper right   hand corner of your display but guys this is a  beautiful kick up to the famous star over here   and i got to admit the fact that you can get this  in a single which is awesome the double which is   how they advertise it or even the triple you have  a lot to look forward to especially if you love   the beef over here because it is pretty banging so  with that said i'm gonna have to give the all-new   fiery double famous star hero carl's jr an awesome  9 out of 10 it may lose a point because the   flavor of the cheese simply wasn't there and now  that i think about it possibly because of the   heat of the sauce itself drowning everything out  that may have been the reason for that but even   still it did help to hold everything together  as i usually say it is the glue to do just that   this burger is still super delicious easily worth  your time and like i said if you're a spice head   you have a lot to look forward to big time okay  now the all-important question aside from asking   if you're going to give this one a shot because  if you've made it this far into the review you're   probably going to are you actually going to  get this one in a single double or a triple   drop those comments down below and definitely  let me know and with that this is Ian K   closing out another
