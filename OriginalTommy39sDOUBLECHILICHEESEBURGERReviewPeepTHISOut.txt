 we're back at it with another high quality  foodie feature for you here on the channel this   time headed into a spot that i get asked pretty  often to check out here in southern california   and it's none other than the original tommy's so  stay tuned because they're double cheeseburger   with world famous chili is up next welcome to  peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty hey how you doing you know peep this out can i  just go for a double cheeseburger and that's it   i'm sorry oh yeah everything else is good okay  thank you you know i haven't been to tommy's in   over 10 plus years this is going to feel like  a whole brand new experience for me right now   heck it already does awesome thank you man  all right i appreciate you brother thank you   stay frosty we'll see you all right guys let's  peep this out since 1946 and for the first time   here in the channel here we go with the original  tommy's double cheeseburger and this is already   not disappointing in the chili department guys  you'd be hard-pressed to tell me there's actually   burger meat in this there's a sizeable amount of  their world-famous chili on display right here   so let's pop this sizable fresh bun and take a  look underneath it and obviously what you guys   are seeing there is what they call a beefsteak  tomato slice we've got plenty of pickles we've   got some chopped onions we've got some mustard  and i gotta say this is actually looking really   nice just to set it off for the color but that's  all sitting on top of two 100% all beef patties   and i'm actually liking that guys you can kind  of see that it's in there supposedly separated   with cheese but guys there's so much world famous  chili on this you'd be hard-pressed to tell me   that there's meat in here like i told you earlier  this looks really insane so yeah guys i gotta be   real careful with this one in the car there is  plenty of that world famous chili on the bottom   of this one and actually you can kind of see the  burger patties kind of peeking out right over   there but let's just give this a shot guys i'm  very impressed with the appearance of this one   and the weight of it this thing is pretty  hefty in my hand right now for a little   under five bucks that's not a bad deal here we  go it's my first time going in on the all-new   for me anyway because it's been so long it's the  original tommy's double cheeseburger here we go oh all right first things first the grease is real  on this right now guys i mean the flavor instantly   gets you right when you bite into this one there  it's got just the right amount of saltiness it's   not crazy over the top but the nice beefy  flavor from the chili is an easy standout   the world famous chili here obviously it's got  that name for a reason a lot of places throw that   around but this is legit guys it really is pretty  awesome and honestly it complements the two beef   patties that i bit into with that one and i got a  sizable amount of the onions and some pickles guys   and again the pickles they're not super thick  but i am digging these these really add some   overall deliciousness to the overall package with  this one but so far guys not even the tomato i'm   tasting with this one which is fairly thick but  all the flavor of the chili is really going for   it this is pretty banging all right let me open  this one up a little bit more for you and i'll   give you the close-up because you're going to want  to take a look at the inside of this one hang on so there are the two 100% all beef patties  that are leaning back in the cut guys they   were hiding under all the chili in this one here  but as you can see they're fairly value-sized not   overly juicy but the flavor from the chili is  what's adding the moisture to everything here   as you can see we've got in the very top we've  got the pickles the tomato the onions the mustard   the cheese this really is very decadent right  now and like i said the delivery system to get   this into my face right now with that fresh bun is  lighting this one up in the flavor department this   is really really tasty oh and did i mention it was  greasy guys you can't go in on a chili burger and   not have some type of orange somewhere on the  bun because that is the legitness right there as   you can see the creaminess of everything is  really on showcase there the mixture of the   cheese with it and again one more shot of all  the beef in this one here this is really tasty   and again the heft is real this is pretty  big right now let's go for a few more bites oh yeah the mustard is coming through right  there nice touch with that really is man this   is crazy like i mentioned earlier i'm not even  tasting the tomato at all it's a fairly thick   cut of tomato on this one what they're calling  a beef steak tomato it's more like a filet the   way that it looks actually but the thickness  is adding a little bit overall to what you're   seeing here but guys the quality of the chili  is what's standing out it's got just the right   amount of beefiness the saltiness and again it's  got the greasiness it's got the grease factor   i'm so glad that i've got plenty of burger diapers  around me here right now you don't even want to   see what's around me literally tons of napkins  right now i got to get myself a car tray i don't   know but guys let's go for another bite on this  one this is really something delicious right now   and i gotta say please accept my humble apologies  for waiting so long to do this i'm so glad that i   finally have this on the channel this is super  super delicious a couple more bites and then   we'll wrap this one up but guys very very  tasty if you guys are in southern cali you   need to be jumping on over to give this a shot  and again i'm sorry i waited so long let's go man you know i was really into this burger  literally after the first bite but now that   i'm about halfway into it i'm enjoying it that  much more i may have to swing on back to try   some other stuff on the menu and now that i think  about it if you guys want to see the chili cheese   fries here on the channel drop some comments down  below let me know if you guys want to check those   out there i'm kind of curious about them myself  so let me know down below if that's something you   think you'd like to see but guys i'm so glad to  have given this one a shot right now it's crazy   delicious as i'm getting further in like i said  let's go for one more bite we'll close this one   out after the rating and then we'll wrap this  one up this is an easy recommendation hang on   all right so let me try and do this as careful as  possible here i'm gonna try and give you a shot of   the back of this one here guys because there is  plenty of chili on display here as well look at   this guys it's crazy a lot of goodness here as you  can see they do it really well over here at the   original tommy's they're world famous for a reason  and their chili really stands out the thinness   of the meat patties is the only thing naturally  but together with everything else here it works   extremely well and i'm definitely digging the  mustard and pickle combination with those chopped   onions and again no tomato in sight flavor-wise  but overall i'm really loving what i got here guys   really good so jumping right to the rating i'm  gonna have to give the double cheeseburger here   at the original tommy's a rock solid 9 out of  10 and i gotta be honest guys the main showpiece   for this one is easily gonna be the world famous  chili the beef was just decent on it i couldn't   really taste the cheese at all it really was the  flavor of the chili itself and that really is the   main thing with that along with the crunchiness of  the veggies on that as well so for me personally   i think had i gotten maybe the quarter pound  version of the burger that would have been a   little bit better but guys it was very hard to  manage here in the car considering what i got   and again given how plentiful the chili was on  that i'm not hating on it at all because the   flavor was pretty awesome on it guys and again  a very sizable double cheeseburger with a whole   bunch of chili thrown into the mix just a lovely  situation and super fun to finally do here on the   channel for you all right so i've got one basic  question for you if you ever get a chili burger   do you actually put cheese on it i mean do you  actually taste the cheese well that's actually   two questions but you get my drift right drop  some comments down below and definitely let me   know and with that this is Ian K closing out  another high quality foodie feature for you   here on peep
