 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty Pizza Hut unveils a snack cracker Pizza hybrid that no one asked for but let's just say if you're a fan of cheez-its you're probably losing your mind right about now that's right get ready for it it's a stuffed cheez-it pizza from Pizza Hut and let me just say guys the aroma in my car right now is insane it is already winning in that department it definitely smells like an authentic cheez-it cracker situation here as you can see we've got four squares of crusty goodness filled with cheese and of course on the top we've got that sharp cheddar the cheez-it flavor that they're known for here obviously and a little side of marinara sauce for dipping a little bit on the overcooked side on my version of it at least here but as you can see looks like we've got some cheesy goodness on the inside so really really nice in terms of the presentation aside from maybe just a slight burn edge on a couple of them here but man that smell is really really insane guys take a look at that it's even got that trademark hole right there in the middle which is kind of cool looking really tasty with the exception of the burnt sides like I keep coming back to it it's the only thing it's kind of killing it there it's not as orange as I would have liked but let's give this a go it's the stuffed cheez-it pizza from Pizza Hut let's peep out this flavor yeah they definitely nailed the aroma on this one perfectly it really does smell like an authentic cheez-it cracker guys and again I'm really digging the way that it looks with that trademark hole in the very top here guys looking really really nice and they do have some heft to them as well a nice amount of cheese so really really cool all right so before I take my first bite to

me right now let's give this a shot it's the stuff cheez-it pizza just the cheese version right now let's give it a go mmm-mmm the cheese is rich the sharp cheddar is pretty nice on that that's actually really really nice not overly greasy but it does have a lot of nice sharp cheddar coming up on the back end and a fairly decent crust on this one I know it's a little bit toasty around the edges but I'm not minding that at all the cheese is a little bit more caramelized on the bottom it's a pretty tasty treat let's keep going mmm yeah let's get another look at the crust on this one guys looking really really nice and as you guys can see in the very middle right there not a bad amount of cheese I'm actually very surprised they were a little bit on the hefty side when I picked them up so I was hoping they were gonna be heavy but still very thin but as you can see it pretty much covers all the way in there guys and the crust itself is a nice complement to it here I just wish I had a little bit of dusting on the top I think that would have been kind of cool but presentation wise it looks pretty authentic and a toastiness is definitely on point flavor is really good you know for all you pepperoni lovers out there you can actually get this with pepperoni as well and I opted to actually not do that today I wanted to go for just the regular cheese version because it's a cheez-it I wanted that full cheese explosion and I'm actually getting it I'm actually very surprised it's really really tasty for what this is but on the real just between you and me calling this a stuffed cheez-it pizza is pushing it just a little bit guys because this is really not pizza at all it's just cheese on the inside of some regular crust and I get that we're gonna get into some marinara right now and that's what kind of takes it up a notch but this is really just a really tasty side item but with that cheez-it flavor that you pretty much know and like I said if you're a fan of that to begin with you're probably losing your mind right now right let's keep going with it and then we'll get into some marinara mmm all right it's Pizza Hut so we've got some pizza sauce to drop into over here guys the marinara goodness going along with the cheez-it goodness let's see how this is the marinara is already kind of drowning out the smell of the cheez-it here so I hope this is gonna be good it's alright to be honest it really does mask all the major flavor coming from the cheez-it itself so I'm not really digging the fact that the marinara comes with this I understand why they do it but this on its own is really all you need it really is yeah that last bite was a lot better because I was getting more of the mozzarella flavor as well as the cheez-it flavor so overall I definitely love the texture I love the way that it feels and the overall amount of cheese that it's got on the inside seems pretty plentiful and considering it's only four squares in the box here guys it's actually not a bad amount that you're getting the only downside is the price is just a little high for what it is but hey thing that these are supposed to be on special in about a week or so as part of the 5 and up menu they've got going on over here at Pizza Hut I'm probably gonna be picking these up again because like I said the flavor guys really does deliver and since I'm a fan of cheese how could I not give that a go right the mozzarella cheese goes amazingly well with that sharp cheddar in general all right let's see if I can crack this in the middle for you guys here and see if we can break this apart decent amount of cheese it does kind of get a little hard quick as you guys can see there but a fairly decent amount on the inside guys and the flavor of that cheese it is really coming through not overly greasy a decent amount of cheese on the inside and just overall a pretty tasty side item guys it's the mash-up nobody asked for but I'm kind of glad that it's here it's pretty tasty not too much else to say about that one guys I think you know how I feel about it I would definitely rock this one again and with that new promo coming up I absolutely will so with that said I'm gonna have to give the stuffed cheez-it pizza here at Pizza Hut a rock-solid 8.5 out of 10 if only the price point was just a little lower and maybe a few more we're thrown into the box at least maybe that I would've definitely rated this one higher but as it stands the flavor delivers it's very reminiscent of that classic cheez-it flavor and guys it's mozzarella cheese on top of that I would probably skip the marinara sauce try it once but I'm telling you guys the flavor is pretty good now the obvious question is do you agree with me drop those comments down below are you cheez-it fan in general and if you are have you already stormed the gates and beaten down the doors to give this one a try already drop those comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K closing out another episode of peep this out bringing you brand new content every single week here on my channel so while you stay tuned for that next time you come in real soon in the meantime stay frosty okay now I can easily see some other flavors of cheez-its being used with this in the future but if you really want to capture my heart Pizza Hut do a Doritos version of this that would be insane just saying alright guys until next time I'll talk to you soon but hey real quick before you go in just in case you haven't already take a look at the last review that I put out right up over here along with what I think YouTube's gonna recommend for you to check out as well as always I think you'll find something like in both of them and I'll definitely catch 'ya in the next one see 'ya
