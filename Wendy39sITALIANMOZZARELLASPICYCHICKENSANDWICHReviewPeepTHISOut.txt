 [Music] welcome to peep this out reviews with  Ian K stay frosty what's going on everyone   and welcome to the channel where today I'm back  on over at Wendy's to check out another one of   their all-new Italian Mozzarella promo items  and this time I'm getting a little spicy with it   that's right guys as you know Wendy's is not just  known for their fresh never Frozen beef it's also   their chicken which they pretty much rock with  and in this case we're going to be rocking with   the Italian Mozzarella spicy chicken sandwich and  as you can see a very lovely situation leading off   the very top right over there with that fried  mozzarella cheese Patty a lovely situation   let's break this one on down real quick yes sir  this is looking pretty great already with that   garlic knot bun guys a trendsetter already in  the fast food game with this is looking pretty   awesome let's pop in take a look underneath and  what you're going to notice right away is plenty   of marinara sauce and one of the main stars of  the show the fried mozzarella cheese Patty and   it covers everything here pretty nicely deep fried  and I can't wait to get into that underneath that   we've got some asiago cheese and that's all  on top of a spicy breaded white meat chicken   filet again one of the main things that they do  very well over here at Wendy's and it's looking   really really nice and again filling out this  Garlic Knot bun pretty nicely and being that   it's the spicy variant I'm expecting a little bit  of heat with this one here underneath it it looks   like we've got nothing there and that's perfectly  fine because I'd like to keep everything together   with that thing slipping and sliding but guys  a very lovely situation and the presentation is   looking pretty awesome on this one so let's not  waste any more time on this one let's see if the   flavor is going to deliver this is the all-new  Italian Mozzarella spicy chicken sandwich here   at Wendy's let's peep out this flavor you know  I'm not even gonna front I'm sure this is gonna   be very very tasty and especially with that spicy  chicken fillet on the very bottom right there   dovetailing in with the fried mozzarella cheese  Patty action I have a feeling this is going to be   pretty banging and if you're saying how do I know  that well guys I recently did the triple variation   of their Italian Mozzarella cheeseburger over here  definitely take a look at that review jumping up   on your screen here right now that was a behemoth  of deliciousness and I gotta say totally banging   from top to bottom literally because it pretty  much took up the whole portion of my car in the   front here it was pretty awesome but with this I  gotta say very excited to get into something a   little bit more easier to bite into I think and it  looks really really great so let me confirm this   for you I can't wait to get into it I love The  Buttery goodness of this Garlic Knot bun this is   the all new Italian Mozzarella the spicy chicken  variant over here at Wendy's let's peep this out mmm man well right off the break I'm getting  a nice little back burn Sizzle from the spicy   chicken fillet guys that's a lovely situation  right there and naturally what a nice chunk of   that mozzarella cheese to go with in the  marinara sauce the Asiago that's keeping   everything together right there in the middle very  very nice on this so far as I had a feeling it was   going to be of course you have that marinara sauce  as well and definitely the flavor is kicking with   that one on top of that let's keep going in  guys this is pretty tasty this version of it mmm I love the cheese but you knew that  right you know this has just the right amount of   marinara sauce to really kind of keep things moist  and juicy that way because the chicken itself as   I'm getting further in is a little on the dry  side but when you consider that you've got that   mozzarella cheese which is adding a little bit  more of an oily Vibe as well it's a very mild   flavor but you can taste it nicely it goes very  very nice and of course the light butteriness   that I'm getting from that garlic knot bun a very  lovely situation I'm so glad they did something   special with the bun and not just like a brioche  with an Italian Vibe you got to have something   like that that's a great call so let's go for  another couple of bites on this guys very tasty mmm well as expected the reason why I wanted  to do this variation compared to the grilled   initially is because this actually feels more  like a chicken parm Vibe which I'm totally   digging guys with a little bit of that spicy  action coming in there as well adding just a   little bit more dimension in terms of flavor  texturally it's definitely got a lot going on   guys you're getting the nice soft cheese of  course the initial crunchy action the soft   bun and naturally with the crispy fillet  it really does feel like a nice chicken   parm situation with a little bit of extra  heat thrown in for good measure pretty nice   you know as I'm getting further and further  into this right now I can't help but wonder   if it's just a coincidence that this happens to  be out just as BK is offering their variation of   something like this now grant that it's a little  bit different which you're probably seeing jumping   up on the screen here right now definitely check  that one out I had a lot of fun going in on that   but with this variation guys with the fried  cheese that's really the game changer on top of   the Garlic Knot bun and I'm totally Blown Away by  that because it really does dovetail beautifully   into everything else here even if this was just  mozzarella cheese with a chicken patty and sauce   which is usually the expectation having something  like a fried mozzarella cheese Patty on the top   just completely blows everything else out of the  water and the flavor is pretty amazing on this so   again I got to keep showing it to you because  it just looks absolutely amazing the thickness   of that mozzarella cheese Patty is almost like  the chicken itself so a very beautiful situation   it feels almost like a double variation of the  sandwich I'm having here right now let's just   go for one more bite we'll wrap the review with  the rating coming up next but another banging   alternative over here at Wendy's and if you love  The Chicken which a lot of you guys do I'm sure   this is easily something you want to give a  go on one more bite and we'll wrap it up hang on alright so let's go 360 around this  one and while you could get the regular classic   version of this just without the spice I would  recommend going with the spicy variant because   it's not too crazy over the top and it adds just  a little bit of extra in terms of flavor and the   experience overall with everything else here and  actually with that fried mozzarella cheese Patty   the marinara sauce the awesome Garlic Knot bun on  top very very nice overall guys this combination   is beautiful and an awesome variation of the  Italian Mozzarella lineup over here at Wendy's   pretty banging so with that said I'm gonna have  to give the Italian Mozzarella a spicy chicken   sandwich here at Wendy's an awesome 9 out of  10 guys everything was pretty much banging on   that aside from the slight dryness of the chicken  itself again the marinara sauce is going to make   up for that just a bit as well as a little bit  of the oil that you're going to get from that   fried mozzarella cheese Patty the combination of  everything together gave me a little bit more of   a chicken parm Vibe and being that it's a spicy  Patty that added just a little bit more of extra   kick to it so to speak on top of the flavor but  totally banging on that one and again being that   Wendy's is kind of known for chicken on top  of the fresh never Frozen beef this is a great   option to go in on pretty tasty all right so do  me a quick favor like always drop some comments   down below what did you think of the presentation  of this particular one and if you've given this   version a shot along with the burger
