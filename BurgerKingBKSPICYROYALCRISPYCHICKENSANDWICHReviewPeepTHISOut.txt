 what's going on everyone and welcome to the  channel it's Ian K where today i'm over at   bk once again for round three on their  all-new royal crispy chicken sandwiches   that's right and things may be getting a little  heated this time so stay tuned because i've got   the spicy variant up next welcome to peep  this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty well this looks mildly threatening but i'll  let you guys be the judge feast your eyes on   it guys here we go with the spicy royal crispy  chicken sandwich here at bk and as you can see   not bad in the crispiness department for sure  and it looks like this one's going to deliver   a little bit of heat i'm thinking let's break  this one on down real fast so starting us off   it looks like we've got that familiar yet toasted  potato bun and once we pop it underneath you're   going to notice we have a decent amount of that  savory sauce along with some of their shredded   lettuce and as we pan down you'll notice a couple  of slices of tomato and of course plenty more of   that lettuce and that savory sauce and that's  all sitting on top of their new crispy white meat   breast filet that's been dipped into their new  triple pepper spicy glaze definitely a mouthful   of a title there but that's obviously where the  heat is going to be coming from underneath it   looks like we've got more of that savory sauce  but guys coming back to that chicken nice and   crispy although it's fairly thin it's definitely  wide and fills out this potato bun pretty nicely   so let's not waste any more time on this one this  is the all new spicy royal crispy chicken sandwich   here at bk let's peep out this flavor yes sir  triple pepper spicy glaze a mouthful of a title   but let's just hope it's gonna deliver triple  the heat right i'm hoping anyway guys here we   go one last time it's the spicy royal crispy  chicken sandwich here at bk let's peep this out well oh there it is okay   well my mouth is definitely tingling with this  one guys but i wouldn't say it's necessarily   triple the heat guys i mean triple pepper spicy  glaze is fine i guess the name is fun but this   is definitely more of a little slight sizzle  that you're gonna get with this particular one   but it does add to the overall flavor here along  with that savory sauce as you can see it's fairly   juicy and guys i gotta say with the savory sauce  giving a little bit more of an italian vibe i'm   getting a little bit of heat plus a little bit  more of that italian type of edge with this one   so it's actually pretty nice overall and along  with that soft potato bun not bad but again i   wouldn't say triple the heat triple pepper  may be for the ingredients but naturally   it's just more of a sizzle a little bit more of  a bark than a bite but let's just keep going in well i already like this one better than the  classic that i reviewed recently and guys that's   not saying anything bad about that particular one  because it was pretty tasty but with the addition   of that triple pepper spicy glaze that's really  the wild card that really takes this one up a   notch and obviously gives it that little bit of  spicy kick that you're expecting but as you can   see very nice in terms of the overall ingredients  on this one although i do wish it was just a   little bit thicker yeah i'm definitely going  to miss that spicy ch'king that was my all-time   favorite version over here at bk but still this is  not a bad alternative because i'm getting shades   of that in the flavor of that spicy goodness there  now naturally the savory sauce is really what's   mixing beautifully with that and again the italian  vibe that i'm getting it's noticeably different   and obviously that's another major highlight  with this one but still i'm gonna miss the   thickness of the overall last round of chicken  sandwiches over here at bk all right so let's   go for a couple more bites on this one because  that triple prepper spicy glaze again a mouthful   of a title is really doing pretty well with the  overall flavor with this one let's keep going in you know i gotta say with a couple of slices of  tomato on this i'm actually doing okay holding my   own naturally because of the flavor of the sauces  on this one so guys that actually is a very good   thing because as most of you know tomato is not my  forte but again guys the flavor is delivering on   this one so this variation of the royal crispy  chicken sandwiches over here is absolutely a   solid choice and again with that sizzle giving  me a little bit of extra kick with this one   i'm totally digging that all right so let's go  for one more bite of this one before we wrap   the review up with the rating coming up next but i  can already tell you i do like this one more than   the classic and the classic was the pretty basic  out of the group because it's more of the intro   but guys this is a nice addition with a little  bit of heat and for those of you who are not   really down with heat you don't really have too  much to worry about it's just a little bit of a   sizzle but it does add to the experience  one more bite we'll close it out hang on all right well not as thick obviously as the  previous ch'kings you're definitely getting   a flavorful situation thanks to the savory sauce  which again is giving me more of an italian vibe   mixed up very nicely with that triple pepper spicy  glaze and again the last time you'll hear it in   this review an absolute mouthful of a title but  still overall guys you're getting a pretty tasty   chicken sandwich over here at bk even if it is a  little bit on the thin side but still very tasty   overall so with that said i'm gonna have to give  the new spicy royal crispy chicken sandwich here   bk a very well deserved 8.5 out of  10 and as you've heard me say all throughout   this review guys the combination of that savory  sauce along with the triple pepper spicy glaze a   very tasty situation that really is the wild card  to really take this one up a notch and again while   it's not necessarily a thick chicken sandwich  it's flavorful and fairly wide so not bad in that   regard and again like i also mentioned if you guys  are not down with heat don't worry about that too   much it's still very flavorful and i think you'll  be able to handle it alright so for those of you   keeping score at home this is now my third review  out of the four available sandwiches over here at   bk so do me a quick favor drop those comments  down below let me know which is your personal   favorite out of the three and if you've tried any  of these already which is your overall favorite   drop those comments down below and definitely  let me know and with that this is Ian K   closing
