 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K  stay frosty what's going on everyone and   welcome to the channel where today I'm over at BK  for the final time in 2022 to check out the last   version of their all-new International original  chicken sandwiches and truth be told this one's   looking about as American as you can get given  the cheese that it's got yeah I guess American   cheese constitutes the American variant so without  further Ado here you go it's the American original   chicken sandwich and as you can see it looks like  we've covered all bases with this one given the   amount of toppings that it's got and I'll explain  in just a sec let's break it on down for you   all right so as always we've got that long  specialty bun that's unique to the iconic Original   Chicken Sandwich over here at BK and I gotta say  this is looking pretty nice but let's pop it and take   a look underneath and what you're going to notice  right away is no shortage of chopped lettuce and   mayo they really loaded this one up pretty nicely  and it's covered pretty well as we pan on down   you're going to notice we've got two thick slices  of tomato which cover the sandwich pretty nicely   along with two slices of American cheese hence  the name the American Original Chicken Sandwich   outside of the usual mayo lettuce and tomato  those are pretty much the standards when it   comes to sandwich topping so it's all good there  but guys of course the main star of the show to   go along with everything is the original crispy  chicken patty itself the Super Chicken Nugget of   chicken sandwiches as I like to say that elongated  formed Patty that fills out the spoon pretty nicely   fried up to a crispy golden brown not bad guys not  bad at all underneath it looks like they've got a   little bit more Mayo just to kind of sandwich it  all together but guys again a very loaded version   of The Original Chicken Sandwich here because  of those toppings given the Mayo the lettuce   the tomatoes the cheese its a pretty decent amount  here so they there you go it's the third version   of the available International original chicken  sandwiches here at BK let's peep out this flavor   well it looks like there's no escaping the tomato  with this one guys it covers the sandwich from   end to end so you're guaranteed to get that  in every bite and considering I'm not really   a fan of tomato that's a no bueno situation  but it is what it is but presentation Wise   Guys this actually looks pretty decent compared  to the other two that I just did which you're   gonna see jumping up on the screen here right  now I gotta say that Italian variant with the   marinara sauce and the cheese was lovely on top  of the Mexican variant which I really enjoyed   guys considering the spicy queso on that one  that was a blast to check out but with this   variation again definitely decent in terms of  the presentation like I said they're going for   just the standard American route they're calling  this one here and it's cool so let's give it a   shot this is the all-new American original crispy  chicken sandwich here at BK let's peep this out all right okay well right off the break once  I got past the sliminess of that tomato itself   the cheese came out pretty nicely guys and  of course with the crispy chicken that's a   pretty nice combination a very nice amount of  chicken on this one considering it's nowhere   near as thick as the chicken back in the day  much less the Royal crispy chicken sandwich   but what you've got here is fairly decent  in terms of just the chicken nuggetness of   it if I can call it that but guys very nice  in terms of the overall quality with this   one and again that cheese is a standout so  let's go in for a few more bites on this one well outside of the creaminess of the American  cheese this really feels like more of a basic   version of The Original Chicken Sandwich here  at BK I guess you can call this The Original   Chicken Sandwich Deluxe and that's not a bad thing  because if you're a fan of the veggies on this one   it's not a bad alternative to have on the menu  and naturally calling this the American variant   of it I'm going to assume that it's because of the  cheese that's just my opinion though and hey real   quick before I go a little bit further into this  one let me wish each and every one of you a very   happy new year because by the time this review  airs it's most likely going to be New Year's   Eve so guys this technically actually is my final  review of 2022 if you're curious about my top 10   for 2022 definitely take a look at that jumping up  on your screen here right now that was a blast to   put together see where some of your favorites rank  compared to what I thought personally but when it   comes to this version not bad for what I'm looking  at here at least when it comes to the original   chicken sandwiches let's go a little bit further  into this one for a couple more bites hang on you know even after all this time of doing reviews  here on my channel tomato is still not warming up   to me sometimes I can deal with it sometimes  I can't I'm really trying to get through this   particular review right now but I'm not letting  that influence My overall feeling with it because   guys actually the chicken itself is really the  main selling point with this one on top of what   all the other toppings are here so I really dig  the fact that that crispy chicken is standing out   because the saltiness is pretty nice on it and  there is a fairly decent amount of that chicken   that covers the bun pretty nicely so if you like  these particular toppings I think you're going to   dig this particular version in general but if  you're not really a fan of any of the toppings   naturally you can always remove them it's still  a pretty tasty chicken sandwich for what it is so   let's go for one more bite we'll wrap the review  with the rating coming up next but a fun outing   over here at BK for the final review of 2022 let's  go for one more bite and we'll close it out hang on so the iconic favorite that was launched back in  1979 is closing out my year here on the channel   and I gotta say guys I'm glad to have checked  this version out and I'm glad I actually say   this one for last because it is a very very nice  basic version of The Original Chicken Sandwich   here at BK everything you're going to get on this  one should satisfy pretty nicely if you're a fan   of the toppings and again with the saltiness of  the chicken itself which I really like with this   particular one on top of the length with it again I  gotta say it one more time it's the Super Chicken   Nugget of chicken sandwiches and this was actually  really kind of fun to check out right now pretty   cool so with that said I'm gonna have to give  the American Original Chicken Sandwich part of   the international chicken sandwich Trio here at BK  just an okay 6.5 out of 10 and I'm not   gonna go much higher than that guys because like I  said I'm not an ultra fan of the toppings on this   particular one Tomatoes notwithstanding but at  the same time if you're a fan of that stuff you're   gonna dig this version for me it's the chicken  patty itself that's what really sells this one   on top of everything else the saltiness is good  the breading is good again maybe about 80% meat   20% coating really pretty nice overall and again a  nice variation of this particular chicken sandwich   on the menu over here at BK I would like to see  it be on some type of special though considering   the price point 2 for $7 something along  those lines would be pretty cool down the road   let's just hope for that but still pretty good all  right so now that I've completed the trifecta as I   close out 2022 over here at BK with these all new  international original chicken sandwiches which   one is your personal favorite drop those comments  down below out of the three that I've done which   do you think looked the best overall and are you  going to be giving any of these a shot and lastly   if you have given all of them a shot already  which really delivered the most flavor for you   drop those comments down below and definitely let  me know and with that this is Ian K closing out   another high quality foodie feature for you here
