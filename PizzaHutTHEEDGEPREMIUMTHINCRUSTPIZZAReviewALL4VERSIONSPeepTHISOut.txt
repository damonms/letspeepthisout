 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty hey everyone welcome back to another high quality  foodie feature for you here on the channel where   this time pizza hut gets the focus because after  checking out a couple of variations of the detroit   style pizza not that long ago it's now time to  go in in the return of an item that was first   introduced back in 1997 so buckle up because we're  about to get into four different versions of it   so here we go with the first one feast your  eyes on the edge from pizza hut and in this   case it's the ultimate variant featuring a  combination of toppings that include pepperoni   italian sausage green peppers onions and roma  tomatoes and with all those toppings stretching   from edge to edge hence the name you can  obviously see they're not playing around   here guys this is a nice combination of the  goodness right here what it also features is   a sweet tomato sauce along with a unique blend  of cheese garlic and an herb seasoning that's   only available on this pizza so the peeps over  pizza hut we're working on this one to make it   really special for sure guys and i gotta say  this is looking pretty great and naturally   with the premium thin crust looking as good as  it does here guys i'm thinking this is gonna   be pretty tasty but a very nice presentation on  this one this is the ultimate variant of the edge   moving on to number two we've got the carnivore  featuring a nice combination of pepperoni ham   italian sausage and bacon so definitely a meaty  situation for sure on this one guys and of course   the same premium thin crust with all the good  stuff that you heard me mention previously   a very lovely situation on this one and definitely  one to satisfy for any meat lover out there this   is looking pretty great up next is the vegetarian  featuring a nice combination of green peppers   onions mushrooms and roma tomatoes and again the  premium thin crust action that we have on the edge   here is on display guys this is really a very nice  presentation and of course with all those toppings   stretching from edge to edge it looks like every  single piece here has got a nice amount of the   good stuff on here and a great alternative  for those looking to do a pizza without meat   and last but certainly not least we've got the  pepperoni lovers and guys as always lots of   awesome looking pepperoni on top of the edge pizza  here guys this is looking pretty awesome of course   the thin crust action as you know from edge to  edge plenty of pepperoni all around and of course   you've got to have a version like this on the menu  guys this is just looking pretty awesome as well   so let's not waste any more time let's get into  all four of these so we can peep out that flavor   so if you're wondering am i really sitting in the  car with four pizzas right now yes i absolutely   am and this is a blast to do guys so starting off  with the ultimate again take a look at that this   is a very awesome situation we've got here guys  the combination of all the toppings again stretch   from edge to edge and you can see the seasoning  pretty nicely on this this is looking really   really good so let me do this very carefully here  in the car let me pull up one of these pieces here   this is looking nice really really nice guys look  at that the seasoned goodness you can see that all   those seasonings are really popping pretty nicely  and again the toastiness of that crust in the   bottom i'm digging that already this is feeling  nice and crispy in my hands let's give this a   shot guys it's the ultimate variation of the all  new edge first time for me trying it here we go hold on i'm getting a lightly salted italian  seasoning vibe with this it's not over the top   but it's definitely elevated so it's making my  mouth water just a little bit but in a nice way   guys this combination is nice i'm really digging  the ultimate variations or just like a combo   type pizza whenever i get pizza hut so i'm really  digging the quality the italian sausage is legit   and everything else on here the peppers a decent  amount of the cheese and again the crispiness on   the bottom i am really digging the quality of  this crust here it doesn't feel like a cracker   it feels like a little bit more of a  premium type of product let's keep going in   i am liking this a lot it's just a nice balance  of flavor with this one it kind of feels like   i'm having a supreme pizza but a little bit on the  thinner side naturally because of the edge and of   course the toppings are stretching from edge to  edge guys i'm really digging the marketing name   with this one here it really looks pretty nice  as well and again the crispiness of that crust   is pretty awesome let's go for one more  bite and then we'll move on pretty good um yeah yeah that is pretty good guys it's  gonna be kind of hard to top this one but   we're gonna move on for sure so let me grab the  second box here in this case it is the carnivore   and again a lovely situation of goodness look at  that the bacon action the italian sausage the ham   i'm really digging that the pepperoni  action as well too this is looking really   really great guys i am really digging the  way this looks here and again it doesn't   feel like a cracker i mean it's a little  bit thinner than thin believe it or not   but the crispiness is on point this is looking  really really good guys let's give this a shot   here it's the carnivore variant of the all-new  edge at least new for me let's give it a shot wow the bacon flavor is pretty strong on this and  it combines beautifully with the seasoning guys   and again that is one of the main highlights with  this that's specially formulated herb seasoning   that this has got nice situation with that as well  it's not overly greasy on the pepperonis as well   too and i got to admit again the crispiness is  on point guys just look at the thinness of that   this is looking really really great and again  the quality of the ham the bacon naturally as   well too and the seasoning together is a nice  combination this is pretty banging guys it is oh yeah definitely pretty awesome and considering  pepperoni is not my all-time go-to believe it or   not i'm really more of an italian sausage type of  guy i love the combination of the flavors of this   one along with that seasoning telling you the wild  card is going to be the herb seasoning with this   on top of all the other goodies but nice quality  all right moving on to the veggie i believe   let's give this one a shot and it's very  difficult doing this in the car with four   boxes but i'm having a blast doing it let's get  a look at this one again wow the presentation   is no joke guys look at that from edge to edge you  can really see the goodness there the seasoning is   just popping out ridiculous it really looks great  in the box this veggie probably has i think some   of the best presentations so far aside from that  ultimate variant but guys pretty nice already let   me pick up one of these here we'll give this a  shot and again a non-meat alternative for you   take a look at that looking really nice it's  almost got like a margherita vibe a little bit   here but looking really really good guys look  at that look at how it's made this is really   made pretty perfectly and again the toastiness of  that crust is on point i am digging the quality   of that look right there let's give this a shot  guys the veggie variant of the edge here we go man these are all delicious wow that's good the  mushroom and the onions are my favorite with this   one already and then the green peppers coming up  on the back end and the roma tomatoes all that   good stuff as well but guys a lovely combination  of goodness right there just take a look at that   baked from edge to edge and it's topped from  edge to edge on top of it and again the quality   of that seasoning again that is the wild card  i think that's the secret weapon with this one   on top of the quality of the crust you can  really tell this is a very thin crust guys   and the quality is really speaking for itself  here you know i think this can actually fill up   maybe two or three people because the heartiness  of it is really standing out i mean i'm diving   into this with each bite and it feels like  it's very satisfying so far with the third one   that i'm going with here and guys again the  quality is pretty awesome let's keep going oh yeah you know it's so hard to pick a favorite  right now strictly because it may depend upon   your mood sometimes you may want a pizza with meat  sometimes without obviously you have this choice   this is really really good so just to round  it out let's do the pepperoni lovers now you   guys know how i feel about pepperoni it's not my  ultimate go-to but when it looks as good as this   i am definitely going to make the exception  against the rule over here guys this looks   really really good i mean look at that and  again the seasoning is loaded on this this   doesn't look like your typical thin crust pizza  to me it's really got a lot more going on so it   feels a lot more high quality like that  all right let me pull up this piece here   this one is looking pretty good it looks like  about each piece has about maybe four or five   pepperonis here depending upon the cut but as  you can see that wild card the seasoning is   on display for you guys it's really nice  and again the toastiness on the bottom   a very lovely situation here here we go with the  pepperoni lovers variant of the edge let's do it heavy seasoning on this one oh it's strong  a little on the salty side but i like it   because it's combining with the pepperoni  which is salty anyway but nothing crazy   but with the cheese and that sweet  sauce that's a nice combination wow yeah that's really good and again even  though pepperoni is not my go-to i am digging   the quality of the seasoning along with it here  guys the combination works extremely well it's   a little bit more elevated with this variant  and i think it's done like that for a reason   but guys really nice and again take a look at  the toastiness of the crust there what you're   gonna get on some of these pieces towards  the end is little caramelized cheese action   which is kind of nice and again the quality of  everything here with the cheese that sweet sauce   and overall just a lovely situation and flavor  guys this is a pretty good variant of it as well   well i gotta say it's a little over 80 plus  degrees as i'm filming this one here on the   quote-unquote mobile studio at the moment and i  got to say guys even though i'm doing four pizzas   in the car this is extremely fun to check out  considering it's my first time trying the edge   i'm glad that i'm giving these a shot and guys  the quality of the thin crust is pretty banging   it really is a pretty quality made pizza so while  i'm not going to rate these individually because i   would supplied these pizzas by pizza hut themselves  to kind of check this out early to get my thoughts   on them let me just say i am so glad to have given  this one a shot but i got to be honest out of all   the four that i've got here i still am leaning  towards the ultimate because i do like that rating   wise aside they are very delicious all of them  are actually pretty good depending upon your mood   if you're not into meat naturally you've got  the veggie option but there are plenty of other   options that have all the toppings on there and  again from edge to edge with the seasoning the   premium crust the toastiness of the crust as well  really speaks for itself and i gotta come back to   it guys because the herb seasoning itself that  is the wild card I firmly believe it to really   generate the extra flavor push that i'm getting  with this here because the quality of the toppings   is pretty awesome in general but that seasoning  is lighting it up even further and again with the   premium crust i'm glad to have been pushed over  the edge so to speak in flavor because this is   definitely doing the job right now no matter which  version you get with this I think you're gonna dig   it it's pretty tasty all right so a couple of  quick questions for you first and foremost do   you remember the edge when it first came out  back in 1997 did you actually give it a shot   and out of these current 2021 variations which one  are you personally looking forward to trying first   drop some comments down below and definitely  let me know and with that this is Ian K   closing out another high quality foodie feature  for you here on peep this out reviews bringing   you brand new
