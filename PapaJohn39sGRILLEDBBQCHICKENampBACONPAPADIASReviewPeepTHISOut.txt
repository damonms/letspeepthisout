it's up next welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty well the aroma in my car is definitely strong even with the Box closed and that's never a bad thing so let's go in on this grilled barbecue chicken and bacon papadia and as always a very crispy situation guys I'm always loving the presentation of these nice and toasty right there split down the middle let's take a look on the inside see what we are working with here wow this is very hot right now plenty of barbecue sauce we've got some chicken we've got some bacon plenty of cheese it looks like and of course some onions are thrown into the mix right there but man that is really strong let me pop the other side here real quick let's take a closer look again more barbecue sauce they are very liberal with it it's looking really good and again the heat coming off this right now is strong for dipping with this version we've got you guessed it even more barbecue sauce to go in on so this should be pretty interesting guys let's see if the flavor is gonna deliver on this one it's the fourth and final selection in the current crop of papadias here at Papa John's the grill barbecue chicken and bacon let's peep out this flavor yeah this really does smell pretty fantastic and while I'm not a super fan of barbecue sauce on say like a traditional pizza this is anything but traditional guys these papadias are pretty awesome for what they are and given the sandwich aspect of what they're selling with this one this really does feel like a barbecue chicken sandwich right now just kind of folded over with pizza dough so let's not waste any more time with this one but like always before I get started if you guys are fans of high quality delicious looking food reviews make sure to hit that subscribe

there's more of these is the grilled barbecue chicken and bacon let's do it oh wow Oh man there are so many thoughts running through my head right now and first things first bacon man that's awesome I got lots of crunchy bacon and cheese in that first bite and then the barbecue sauce comes up on the back end with this one guys chicken is also very juicy and then the onions an explosion of flavor this is pretty much up there with the Philly cheese in terms of just the explosiveness of everything it's got going but guys I have to say the sweet tanginess of that barbecue sauce is bangin on this let's keep going I'll give you another close-up it's really good mmm well I bit the heck out of the middle of this one guys because after that first bite I was definitely invested this is seriously a very solid variant of the papadias over here and like I said with barbecue sauce not really being my thing on a traditional pizza it works amazingly well with everything on the inside of this those onions are definitely the wild-card for me along with plenty of that bacon but man this is just really really great and of course the toastiness of the crust is off the chart and speaking of crust I've got a nice section of it ready to go right now with of course more of that barbecue sauce let me go for a quick bite again and then we're definitely gonna get into more barbecue sauce with a nice chunk right there in the middle hang on hmm mmm I love how crunchy and toasty it is the barbecue sauce is killer man it really is it works so well on this one along with the crunchiness of that bacon which is awesome so let's see how even more of the barbecue sauce goes with the nice meaty chunk I've got there in the middle let's go for a dip man the aroma off the individual barbecue sauce is off the chart already guys very pungent and strong all in its own and as you guys can see nice and thick let's give this one a shot right now this is literally a barbecue sandwich right now and I don't mind it one bit let's do it mmm man I don't know what else to say about this the chicken the bacon the cheese the crust let's go for another dip I'm just gonna hang out and have lunch on camera with you this is crazy mmm mmm my god insane guys insane the more I'm getting into this right now especially with the extra barbecue sauce the more tart that it's getting the more my mouth is watering from it it is just a crazy situation and of course with a nice crispiness of the crust it is just off the chart in general guys let me go for just a little bit more actually because this barbecue sauce on its own is really good one more quick bite of this one I'll give you a close-up of the other one because there's not too much to see with this right now and then we wrap it up with the rating guys really really good hmm yeah this second half is definitely not making it home guys I'm really loving how nice and thick it is right there in the middle and the crispiness of that crust is just off the chain guys and I have to admit again the fact that it's folded over and it's thin really goes to show you that these sandwiches are no joke over here they are definitely well done plenty of barbecue sauce on this variant and the overall bacon flavor along with everything else the onions is definitely off the chart in terms of the flavor just a nice variation and a great way to close out this series of papadias here at Papa John's so with that said I'm gonna have to give the grilled barbecue chicken and bacon papadia here at Papa John's a rock-solid 9 out of 10 this kind of felt like more of like a Southwestern type of chicken sandwich to me guys just a little bit of an Italian flair given the pizza dough but the flavor worked amazingly well the onions had some great flavor just everything was very very flavorful and of course plenty of barbecue sauce as if the actual papadia didn't have enough of it already I love dipping into even more of it so that overall flavor really satisfied overall and like I said with the bacon on top of everything guys it really was just really really great so definitely a solid variant to check out especially if you love barbecue there's no shortage of it here but hey if barbecue is not really your thing you've got three other choices to go in on so take a look at the Papa John's playlist popping up on your screen here right now and take
