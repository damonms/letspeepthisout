 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty Wingstop celebrates their 25th anniversary with its new 25 days of flavor promo which means they're releasing 6 remixed wing flavors throughout July so here we go with the first two guys feast your eyes on the lemon garlic and the dragon's breath and already there is a serious battle going on in my car with the aroma definitely lighting it up in both the heated category as well as the cheesy category there is definitely something going on here looking pretty nice I decided to go with six boneless wings splitting the flavors between the two of them here as you can see starting off with the lemon garlic we've got the combination of garlic parmesan and they're popular lemon pepper it's definitely my favorite for sure lots of parmesan goodness there as you can see and right next to it just waiting to mess me up is the dragon's breath which is a combination of a spicy Korean Q and atomic and the atomic guys is their hottest flavor definitely featuring some crushed red pepper Chile de árbol habanero and cayenne I hope I'm pronouncing all that correctly but it looks kind of threatening as well as a nice little barbecue situation as you can see there guys but absolutely heated for sure on the side decided to go with a side of their fries here as you can see seasons up pretty nicely a little side of ranch to go with that but we're gonna be focusing on these guys let's see what the flavors are all about on both of these it's part of the new 25 days of flavor here at wings stop let's peep out this flavor so are you a fan of

every week now let's dive into these alright so let me start off with the lemon garlic because I really want to save my palate from being destroyed from that dragon's breath I have a feeling it's gonna happen with everything on that one let me started off slow by picking up one of these boneless wings aka glorified chicken nuggets that's pretty much what this is let's go for it it's the lemon garlic part of the 25 days of flavor here at Wingstop mmm instant lemon tartness combined with some of that cheesy Parmesan goodness on the outside of that crispy coating guys that is a very lovely situation along with the saltiness coming up as I'm talking I'm tasting it more and more pretty good I have to admit that's really tasty the only thing though the white meat chicken as I was fearing is a little dry it usually is sometimes it's juicy sometimes it isn't more often than not it's a little on the drier side so the coating is really holding this one with the light pepper that I'm getting along with it along with the parmesan along with the lemon the citric acid everything working together is a pretty nice combo one more bite we'll go for that close up and we're definitely gonna dip this in some ranch mmm the chicken quality is legit as you can see but also there is no visible juiciness to speak of here guys so it is a little on the dry side everything else here is what's holding its own making it very very flavorful a combination of the lemon and as well as the parmesan is a beautiful situation why I haven't mixed these two together over the years is beyond me but I'm definitely gonna be getting it again like this nicely done so far yeah I've always been a fan of the coating here at Wingstop when it comes to their boneless wings it's got just the right amount of friedness to it the crunchiness to it there as well and the flavor just overall works but let's see how that combines with all those other flavors with some ranch and I'm so glad I have a nice container of it as well super thick and definitely rich looking let's give this one a shot this just can't be bad because I've had these flavors separately with ranch and they Rock mmm all together though the cheesiness with that ranch oh and then that lemon as well that's a beautiful sexy combination Wow mmm oh yeah all right now let's get into the dragon's breath and truth be told one of the motivating factors for me to check this out right now was the fact that it combines atomic which I've never had along with spicy Korean Q which I've actually done way back in the day you guys can find that review popping up right over here right now but this guys like I said feels threatening it smells threatening I'm a little worried about it let's give this a shot it's the dragon's breath here here at wingstop   mmm it's slow ooo it's slow oh but here oh here it comes Ooo literally dragon's breath guys oh that's lighting up my mouth ridiculously here right now hang on I don't know if I like this one mmm I got some unsweetened tea just to kind of assist it's not doing too much to right now in the assist apartment then they go for one more bite we're gonna get into some ranch ooo no bueno guys no bueno it's heated don't get me wrong it is tasty because it's chicken but the heat is really coming up on the back right now it really is pretty strong for me mmm let me get in the ranch keep it together Ian keep it together I can barely talk right now because my mouth is very lit up it's borderline uncomfortable for me guys but I do like the flavor on this one believe it or not it's a challenge let's give it a go with some ranch let's do it you know let me go for a little bit of extra on this one guys because I really need it here we go mmm cool it down that's the stuff right there so good okay I'm liking that one just a little better although I really feel like I'm sweating right now my eyes are kind of tearing up I can barely talk right now because of that combination guys the sweetness and I'm kind of getting from the spicy Korean Q along with the atomic craziness that I'm getting from that flavor is no bueno you know what hang on one second here because I'm having a lot of trouble today doing this mmm Wow I probably should have gotten a little bit more ranch I know they give you a lot to begin with but I'm gonna need to stock up on that if I decide to give that one another go but as it stands I'm not gonna be doing it immediately the lemon garlic though definitely those combinations of the flavors with that or an amazing situation I kind of feel like my voice is beginning to go my lips are literally numbing up right now this is this is pretty crazy right now and I'm capturing this all on camera for you guys mmm all right let me give you one more fast close-up of this dragon's breath because it literally is annihilating my body right now as we speak and then we'll wrap this one up and here I thought my tolerance for spice was going up after all the years of reviewing various items here on my channel but obviously this is telling me I've still got a ways to go because it really is giving me a run for my money here guys don't be fooled by how nicely barbecued this looks in terms of the sauce it is absolutely threatening and the dragon's breath name is warranted get ranch on the side with this one and if you like spice definitely give this a shot it's gonna give you a run for the money if you haven't tried atomic already this is pretty great I don't know how much time I voice has left guys so let me just get into the ratings on these two right now real fast for the lemon garlic flavor here Wingstop that's gonna get an easy 9 out of 10 those combinations of flavors of the parmesan and the lemon worked extremely well the only downside is the white meat itself a little on the dry side but guys it's a very healthy nugget and it definitely has the flavor to match and as for the appropriately named dragon's breath which is completely messing me up right now that's gonna get a rock-solid 8 out of 10 and guys it's up there strictly because the ranch really helps it that combination of the creaminess and the coolness of it along with the crazy heat in general really takes that to a different flavor profile than I think you're initially expecting but on its own guys its heated the atomic flavor is appropriately named as well because it really does deliver some crazy heat and my mouth right now is so numb in the back of my throat is numb as well I don't even know how this is gonna come out when I watch this footage back the guy's a delicious flavor nonetheless and definitely give it a go if you're a spice head you have a lot to look forward to with this one which of course is gonna lead me to ask you are you gonna give these two new flavors a shot drop some comments down below are you excited to give the dragon's breath a shot you guys think you can handle the heat on that one
