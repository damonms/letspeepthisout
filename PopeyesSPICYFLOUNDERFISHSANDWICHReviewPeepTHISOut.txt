 what's going on everyone welcome or welcome back  to the channel it's Ian K where today i'm over   at popeyes because it looks like we've got the  return of their flounder fish sandwich just in   time for the season of lent that's right so stay  tuned because i've got the spicy version up next   welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty all right fish season is officially under  ways let's take a look at the spicy flounder   fish sandwich here at popeyes and already  guys lots of crispy goodness on display   for you with this one i'm totally digging  how this fillet is sticking out the bun   and with those pickles on the bottom right  there i think this is going to be pretty tasty   all right so breaking this one down from top to  bottom what we've got is their lightly toasted and   buttery brioche bun and underneath it it looks  like a fairly decent portion of spicy mayo and   as we pan down you're gonna notice it's sitting  very nicely on top of that crispy fillet guys   that wild called crispy flounder is definitely  looking pretty awesome marinated in the usual   louisiana goodness over here and i gotta say very  sizable of course it's taken up this whole bun   and then some underneath it we've got a couple of  barrel cured pickles and if you guys are getting a   chicken sandwich vibe with this one you have every  right to feel that way because this is the exact   same setup as you get with their chicken sandwich  with that spicy mayo and the pickles but guys it's   all about the flounder with this one so there you  go looking pretty crispy this is the all new spicy   flounder fish sandwich here at popeyes let's peep  out this flavor yes sir lots of tasty goodness   with this one and again with the crispiness  looking as amazing as this does right now this   is really taking me back to my initial review  of their cajun variant that came out last year   i gotta say that was a pretty lovely situation as  well take a look at that review that's popping up   on your screen here right now that version was  their initial intro with this particular one   and naturally with that being tartar sauce and  pickles it was a pretty lovely situation i had a   lot of fun checking that out whereas this version  has got all the goodies from the chicken sandwich   so the spicy mayo and the same pickles but guys a  lovely situation indeed and again the crispiness   is looking so so good on this and again that filet  is really taking up his bun nicely so let's get   into this guys finally it's their all-new spicy  flounder fish sandwich here popeyes let's do it oh man already wow well right off the top  i'm totally digging the mouthfeel with this   one guys i mean the light softness and the  toastiness of the bun combines beautifully   with the outer texture and the coating of the  flounder itself and speaking of the flounder   it is a very lovely situation on the inside nice  and flaky this definitely feels pretty fresh and   when you dovetail right into the pickles the snap  crunch and acidity goes pretty beautiful with the   light sizzle that i'm getting from that spicy  mayo this definitely feels different from the   last time around but the heat is a little bit  more up there and i gotta say the combination   is pretty nice but i gotta say while i'm  not necessarily a fan of fast food fish even   though i've had some pretty good experiences  especially the last season with some of the   fish sandwiches that i reviewed there's plenty  of them spread out all throughout the channel   whether it's mcdonald's whether it's carl's jr  i gotta say the combination of flounder is so   different and i'm so glad that they're doing  this over at popeyes because it's not the same   usual pollock or that type of situation you  would get in fish sandwich you don't see a   lot of fast food places offer flounder it's a  pretty nice combo and when it's done as good   as this one is right now i'm totally digging it  let's keep going in guys very flavorful on it well if you've had the spicy chicken sandwich over  here at popeyes and at this point who hasn't you   know exactly what to expect with this one with the  exception of the protein of choice being flounder   so you're getting that same flavor of the spicy  mayo and the pickles and of course the brioche bun   and the crispy goodness naturally but on the  inside of it of course the flounder guys and   i have to say the flaky action with this  one is very nice and i love the fact that   it's wide and sizeable definitely a lovely  situation on this one presentation wise   and cross shot wise it looks pretty awesome as  well i mean guys you're getting a very sizable   piece of fish on this one it covers the whole bun  and i love the way it kind of flops off the sides   right there so it feels like you're getting your  money's worth even though it's about 50 cents more   expensive than the chicken sandwich this is the  same price point as the version i reviewed last   year but i'm loving the fact that the spicy mayo  is so much more prevalent with this one the tartar   sauce is actually pretty decent as well if you  decide to go for the classic that's actually the   same version from last year but with this one  having that spicy mayo this is going to be my   go-to as this one is available because it works  so much better and that light sizzle that i'm   getting is definitely a bomb situation let's go  for another couple on this one guys pretty good yeah so like i said i'm with me not being a super  fan of fast food fish even though i've had some   pretty decent experiences over the last year or  so i have to say this is probably my favorite   variation of it because again it's so different  it's not the usual type of fish fillet that you   would get elsewhere but the quality stands  out and again with that flounder action guys   i really love the way that it looks and you  can really taste everything beautifully it's   got just the right amount of spicy mayo  on this one and with the pickles a lovely   situation i would have liked maybe a couple of  extra to be honest to kind of cover the bottom   but still what you're getting is super flavorful  all right so let's go for one more bite in this   one because honestly i think you get the  point this is a pretty awesome fast food   fish sandwich guys and again because it's  flounder and it's made the way that it is   over here at popeyes it's only adding to the  overall quality that i'm having right now all   for a little under five bucks not bad and again  super sizable let's go for one more bite hang on well i don't miss the tartar sauce on this  one bit and chances are the last time this   was available you were probably hacking it this  way anyway with the spicy mayo and guys that's   officially what this is on the menu now and  i have to say it works very very nicely the   overall crispiness goes with the flounder  beautifully and you'd expect that when   you combine it with the pickles on this one  you've got a very solid flavor profile guys   so this is an easy recommendation by far  you should definitely give this one a shot so with that said i'm gonna have to give the  spicy flounder fish sandwich here at popeyes a   pretty rock solid 9 out of 10 guys it's a very  beautiful sized filet and that really sets the tone   for everything in this one and naturally with  the crispy goodness on the outside mixing with   that spicy mayo and the pickles you're getting  a very solid flavor profile it's not overly   fishy in terms of the taste but it tastes like  a quality fish fillet nonetheless and again with   the flakiness on the inside this was made very  fresh right now guys and i have to say the quality   was absolutely there so an easy recommendation  and like i said for $4.50 same prices last year   not a bad deal all right so do me a quick favor  drop some comments down below if you've had the   flounder over here at popeyes were you actually  hacking this back in the day to begin with i   mean last year when this was first available did  you put spicy mayo on this outside of the tartar   because that's really the main difference with  this one in addition to the seasoning on the   outside of the coating drop those comments  down below and definitely let me know and   with that this is ian K closing out another  high quality foodie feature for you here on   peep this out reviews bringing you brand new  content every single week here on my channel   so while you stay tuned for that next  review coming real soon in the meantime   stay frosty yes sir now we've got a pretty  tasty fish sandwich to go in between the times   we get the chicken sandwich over here
