 hey everyone welcome back to another high  quality foodie feature for you here on the   channel where this time i've hit up del taco  because they're bringing back their crunchtadas   after seven plus years and this time  we've got a few different choices available   that's right and since you clearly know the title  to this one since you've clicked on the thumbnail   anyway guys feast your eyes on the chicken  guacamole crunchtada and i gotta say i am   digging the presentation of this one already guys  this is piled high with the good stuff for sure   so breaking this one down bottom up this time  we've got a thick and wavy corn shell topped off   with a whole bunch of beans we've got marinated  chicken a ranch sauce lettuce grated cheddar   cheese diced tomato and of course in the very top  house-made guacamole guys this is pretty much the   big gun out of the three and i gotta admit it is  looking really really great yesir definitely   some tasty looking stuff here guys and i gotta  say this is feeling very hefty in the hand guys   i'm really digging the amount of food i have here  for three bucks that's not bad at all all right   so before i get into this one and guys i gotta  admit this is a little bit of a milestone because   my very first del taco review that i've done here  on peep this out reviews was the original crunchtada   tostada i'll be sure to have a link jumping  up on your screen right now so you can take a look   at that one but just so you know also since it was  my first review it's a little on the cringe-worthy   side guys but hey you got to start somewhere  right so speaking of starting somewhere how am   i going to do this with this box here with kind of  windy action going on around me here right now let   me just try and lift this up and show it to you  i'm going to keep this over me as much as i can   while the wind is blowing but guys presentation is  pretty banging on this guys it looks really really   great so let me go for a bite hopefully this  doesn't fall apart here we go it's the chicken   guacamole crunchtada returning here to del taco  at least this new variant is brand new here we go i got everything in that first bite oh yeah   come on right off the break with this one guys  the ranch sauce along with those smooth beans   is lighting this one up ridiculously and i got  to admit the chicken not too bad as well i got   some nice chunks in there a little bit of the  guacamole on the very top i got a little of   but guys this really feels like a huge open-faced  taco in the palm of my hands here right now i'm   really digging the shell too this is really kind  of nice let's keep going in pretty delicious gotta be careful though yesir this feels  like a supreme chicken taco just open face   with that crispy corn shell guys i am really  digging this right now and it's holding its   composure as well i am really digging the  amount of toppings on this and as you can see   it is piled high with the good stuff i wish i  had a little bit of a cheese sauce that would   be awesome but even still there is plenty of  grated cheddar cheese on this really nice and   hey if you're going to bring back something that's  literally a blast from the past especially for me   considering how much i reviewed over here at del  taco since that time i have to admit i am loving   the fact that i'm doing a newer version of this so  it's reminiscent of what i had back then because   that was more of a simpler item so this one has  got all the nice premium stuff on the very top   of it and again for three bucks you can't hate on  it guys let's keep going in this is really tasty yeah i am really digging the quality of the shell  on this guys it is holding everything together   so nicely here i'll try and tilt  it up just so you can see very nice   fried goodness you can really tell this was really  put in with a little tender loving care because it   is made very well and obviously all the toppings  are very plentiful that housemade guacamole on   the top is a lovely situation and i'm not even  tasting the diced tomatoes which are just a few   of them on here admittedly but with everything  else with the chicken the beans the cheese   and that ranch sauce lovely situation let's  go for a couple more bites guys delicious so yeah speaking of delicious i may have  to swing them back and do the queso beef   variant that i saw in the poster there as well  that one looks pretty awesome guys but this   i have to admit i am loving the fact that the  guacamole is really beginning to shine through now   because i'm getting some more of it in the  very middle i probably should have spread it   out just a little bit but very nice quality  on this guys and like i said piled high for   three bucks this is not bad whatsoever i think  for me personally this should really stay on   the menu because it's so synonymous with del  taco considering what it is and for those of   you peeps who are flying your taco bell flags  at half mass because the mexican pizza is gone   this is a little bit of a shot to those guys  i have a feeling by bringing this one back   so you have something similar but with a little  bit more variety so pretty tasty guys pretty tasty   all right so let's go for one more bite on this  one guys because this is technically the sequel   to my very first crunchtada tostada review over  here at del taco about seven plus years ago so   is this one better than the original is the sequel  better than the original is this The Godfather II   of crunchtadas right now you're about to find out  let's go for one more bite and we'll close it up and here i thought the guacamole was gonna be  the game changer with this one but it's actually   that ranch sauce mixed in with the beans guys  that combination the smooth creaminess and the   overall flavor is dovetailing right in with the  guacamole then you're getting some crunch of that   lettuce and of course the chicken itself just a  lovely situation and of course the crunch in the   crunchtada's named the very bottom of it here is  done very nicely guys a very high quality shell   that is really holding its composure as i'm  getting further into this review it's doing a   pretty good job call one eight seven seven three  ghosted and dell will fight for you so with that   said and for the moment of truth on this one i'm  gonna have to give the all-new chicken guacamole   crunchtada here at del taco a rock solid 9 out  of 10 guys this literally is a 10 out of 10   for me personally i think a cheese sauce would  have been really really awesome on that but as   it stands very fresh ingredients it was done very  nicely the composure of the shell definitely held   its own and i have to admit i think that's The  Godfather II when it comes to food reviews here   at del taco for that same product because i got  to admit this version of it is pretty amazing   guys everything is on point with it especially  the freshness of that guacamole delicious stuff   all right so now for the obvious question aside  from asking if you're going to give this one a go   do you actually remember the crunchtada from  seven plus years ago like i said it was my very   first del taco review and it was fun to do back  then even though a little on the cringeworthy side   if you watch that video but do you remember this  product did you like it drop some comments down   below and definitely let me know and with that  this is Ian K closing out another high quality   foodie feature for you here on peep this out  reviews bringing you brand new content every   single week here on my channel so while you stay  tuned for that next review coming real soon in   the meantime stay frosty you know i'm really glad  i was able to do this one one-handed guys but just   in case something happened during the review that  would have been less than ideal of course i came   prepared alright
