 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty good morning everyone and welcome back to  another high quality foodie feature for you   here on the channel where this time i'm over at  bk early in the am to check out their all-new   breakfast bacon king and this one appears to be  featuring a wild card ingredient that could take   it up a notch or two in the flavor department  so without further ado let's take a look at   this all new breakfast bacon king and initial  first impressions it definitely smells like   breakfast i gotta say guys it looks pretty solid  and it smells pretty solid as well let's pop the   top of this premium brioche bun and take a look  underneath and first things first is that wild   card ingredient the maple buttery sauce first  featured on their french toast sandwich they   came back a few months ago and it's definitely  mapley guys this really smells pretty fantastic   and it's pretty plentiful especially as we pan  down as you're going to see here guys we've got   a decent amount of bacon it looks very very crispy  and guys take a look at all that cheesy goodness   that's two slices of american cheese to go with  all that bacon and naturally we've got a sausage   patty with mild spicing along with some eggs  on top of it and guys i got to admit again that   maple buttery sauce is really lighting this one  up everything looks very very nicely done there   it's a generous portion and it really lights it  up aromatically but still when it comes to all   the bacon the sausage the eggs the cheese it's  standard breakfast goodness but even still i   think that maple buttery sauce is going to be the  ticket to really take this one up a notch so let's   not waste any more time on this one let's see if  the flavor is going to deliver this is the all   new breakfast bacon king here at bk let's peep out  this flavor well in true bk fashion as is the case   with most if not all of their breakfast sandwiches  you can swap out the protein for something   different so if sausage is not your thing you  can definitely load up on more bacon or black   forest ham but we're reviewing this one as is guys  and as you can see i am already digging the way   that maple butter sauce is looking right there in  the middle on top of the sausage it looks pretty   plentiful and like i said it is crazy aromatic  as you'd expect it to be the maple goodness is   lighting up my car all right enough talking  let me see if i can match up the flavor with   the aromatic goodness here we go it's the all new  breakfast bacon king over here at bk let's do it maple right away with that bacon banging yeah  that's a pretty lovely situation flavor-wise   and you immediately get the sausage up front as  you should because of the mild spicing that that   one's got there so that really is the dominant  flavor right after the maple butter which is   pretty plentiful on this there's a lot on here and  again it is delivering and when you combine all   that at the very end with the cheese and with the  egg itself guys this is a very lovely situation   in terms of classic breakfast flavor with a lot of  buttery goodness to boot and again the crispiness   of that bacon is adding a lot to this one here  right now it's a standard brioche bun but even   still it's all breakfast goodness in the palm of  your hand with some really nice maple butter to go   with it and on the real if in the back of your  mind you're probably thinking doesn't wendy's   have something similar with the baconator on their  side yes they do but the main difference with that   version that they have is naturally a swiss cheese  sauce but it still has the same sausage egg and   cheese bacon all that stuff as well this really  could have benefited i think from a cheese sauce   indirectly but going the regular american cheese  route that's cool it's melted it's tasty so even   without a cheese sauce this still goes pretty  head to head with the breakfast baconator and   considering the baconator is a signature over at  wendy's and the bacon king is a signature here at   bk it's pretty obvious guys they are competitors  this is definitely going for it but even still   the wild card being the maple butter is  definitely a highlight let's keep going in you know now that i'm getting further into this  let me just say this thing is really drenched   in that maple butter sauce and that really  is beginning to take it up even further than   i originally thought the flavor is really  going to the roof in the maple department   and guys again with the combination of the  spicing from the sausage again it's not   really the biggest sausage patty i've ever had  but even still at the same time it's filling   this one out nicely with the bacon and the  cheese and with that fluffy egg on the bottom   all those combinations work amazingly well but  guys again the maple butter is very very strong   as i'm getting further in and coming from someone  who's not really into breakfast sausage as i've   said time and time again for the few times that  i've gotten up early to do breakfast reviews here   on the channel the combination is pretty nice  with that maple butter and guys like i said   i'm really glad i got this one as is i probably  could have gotten the extra bacon because the   bacon king is the name i get why they're calling  it that for advertising purposes but the fact   that this has a little bit of everything under  the sun this really is almost like an ultimate   type of breakfast sandwich because you're  getting all the meats together minus the   black forest ham option that would have been a  nice option as well as like a supreme variant   but even still the maple butter along with all  the flavors on this right now are taking it to   a new dimension in flavor all right so let's  go for one more bite of this all new breakfast   bacon king and then we'll close this review out  with the rating coming up but guys let me just   say again even though i'm not a morning person  like i've said a few times in the past and i'm   not into sausage either like this for breakfast  the maple butter is changing my whole dynamic   and the way i'm thinking about this because of  the flavor that it's adding to the overall and   this experience is pretty fun this morning one  more bite and then we'll close it out hang on so let's go around the world with this one  real quick and as you can see all the flavors   of breakfast in the palm of your hand here guys  lots of fluffy eggs lots of melted cheese to go   with and of course with that maple butter that  is really taking this one to new dimensions and   flavor as you've heard at nauseam throughout this  review it really is a nice combination mix all   that up with the mild spicing and just the overall  flavor of that breakfast sausage and the bacon and   you have a very hearty sandwich here for breakfast  guys very lovely stuff and i think worthy of that   bacon king name pretty nice so with that said i'm  gonna have to give the all-new breakfast bacon   king here at bk a rock solid 9 out of 10 talk  about a wild card ingredient to take this one up a   notch or two it really did with that maple butter  and let me just say the combination goes amazing   with everything all across the board as you've  heard me say in this review this really doesn't   need a cheese sauce kind of like the breakfast  baconator at all to really kind of stand out   just the flavor of the maple butter along with  that sausage and especially the bacon together   it's very hearty and with the fluffy eggs and the  melted cheese and that soft premium bun pretty   much wrap this one up with a bow guys just a  nice combination of goodness all around and again   very very flavorful pretty tasty all right so i've  got two basic questions for you first and foremost   are you going to be giving this one a shot i  mean i always ask you guys that and secondly   are you a morning person is this enough to kind  of get you up to go to bk to give it a shot   drop those comments down below and definitely  let me know and with that this is Ian K   closing out another high quality foodie feature  for you here on peep this out reviews bringing   you brand new content every single week here on  my channel so while you stay tuned for that next review   coming real soon in the meantime stay frosty yeah  definitely a banging breakfast sandwich for sure   but bk on the real i think you're missing the  boat by not having a little bit of black forest   ham on this on top of all the other meats you can  easily market this as a supreme breakfast sandwich   or the ultimate breakfast sandwich especially  with that maple butter goodness i mean come on   i think you should get on that alright  guys until next time i'll talk to you soon   hey thanks for checking out another  one of my reviews but just in case you   didn't see the one before this one  you can find it right up over here   along what i think youtube's gonna recommend  for you to check out as well as always i think   you'll find something like in both of them and  i'll definitely catch you in the next one see ya
