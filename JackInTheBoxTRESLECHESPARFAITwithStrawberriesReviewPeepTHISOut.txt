 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty hey everyone I'm back at it cheaters cam style after hours here at jack-in-the-box for a little dessert action late night in the form of their all-new tres leches with strawberries and judging by how smooth that whipped cream looks on top this one definitely appears pretty inviting so feast your eyes on the piece of sponge cake underneath it though that's actually where the name comes from tres leches it's actually a piece of sponge cake soaked in three types of milk evaporated condensed and a heavy cream and naturally we've got some strawberries thrown into the mix and of course topped off with a deliciously looking whipped cream so yeah we're definitely about to peep this one out right now but like always before I get started if you guys are fans of high-quality delicious looking food reviews make sure to hit that subscribe button down below and don't forget to tap the Bell icon so you could be notified as soon as brand new content drops every week here we go it's the tres leches with strawberries at jack-in-the-box and guys I got to admit for the size of this this is actually not bad $2.29 and there is a decent amount of filling a decent amount of cake here we go let's give it a shot let's go for some sweetness late night let's hit it mmm that is heavy heavy but good Wow first off the whipped cream is perfect it's smooth its rich its creamy and the butteriness of that sponge cake is insane a little bit the sweetness coming in on the strawberries is just a little much for me I gotta be honest but everything else is really singing guys nice quality and I have to admit very very delicious and again very heavy you want it to be right it's awesome stuff mmm now obviously as you saw in the initial close-up this is a prepackaged dessert here at jack-in-the-box but even with that aside the quality is top-notch guys you can really taste the nice amount of milk that this cake is soaked in even though it's got a nice airiness to it there is a denseness and a richness on top of it add in the sweetness of the strawberries which is just a little elevated along with that whipped cream and you've got a very very tasty snack here guys this is really pretty good given the nice airiness of the sponge cake itself on top of the heavy flavor that it's got going I got to admit even though I do like the strawberries aside from them being just a little on the sweeter side I really wish this had some chocolate thrown into the mix I think that combination will work really nicely with the milk type ingredients on the inside of this one but guys as it stands very flavorful and like I said heavy but in a nice way it's pretty tasty mmm Wow really good yeah now I'm really wishing that I had some chocolate as I'm getting further and further into this right now the strawberries like I said even they're a little bit on the elevated side in terms of sweetness still deliver a nice amount of variation in flavor overall and it's a combination that works well naturally you got the milk ingredients a little bit of the fruity ingredients and then topping it off with that whipped cream topping as well guys what's not to like about this it is pretty awesome let's go for one more bite of this one and then we'll close this one out after the rating but I think you know this is going to be pretty solid right it is it really is let's go with another close-up shot of this one starting with the container on the outside guys a very decent amount that you get for $2.29 and the quality of everything on the inside really does stand out again the highlight is that sponge cake for sure definitely lots of whipped cream in there as well you guys are fans of whipped cream you obviously have a lot to look forward to with this but if you like a little bit of sweetness extra because of the fruitiness on top of what this one offers you're definitely gonna like the strawberry mix guys nice quality overall and an easy recommendation and like I said for $2.29 not bad for what you get here guys not bad at all so with that said I'm gonna have to give the tres leches with strawberries here at jack-in-the-box a pretty rock-solid 8.3 out of 10 in my opinion if they can just dial back the sweetness of the strawberries just a little bit I have no doubt there's a little bit of extra sugar in here anyway this would easily score just a little bit higher but as it stands it is sweet but it's got some nice quality the tres leches themselves I have to admit the three types of milk into that sponge cake is a beautiful situation evaporated condensed it's still going to be sweet but with that heavy cream added into the mix it's lovely guys but again please I want to see a chocolate version of this it needs to happen it really does now of course the question is based upon this version as is with the strawberries is this something that you think you personally might want to try drop some comments down
