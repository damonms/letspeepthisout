 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty we're going in and another one of the new all-day breakfast chicken sandwiches here at McDonald's and this one's looking to bring some buttermilk goodness to their popular McChicken that's right it's the McChicken biscuit featuring you guessed it a buttermilk biscuit and a McChicken patty two main ingredients very simple let's take a look at this biscuit really quick before we pop it a very flaky buttery situation this is exactly what you would get with any of the other breakfast sandwiches featuring the biscuit here at McDonald's let's take a look underneath obviously no sauce we got nothing else here the same standard chicken patty we've got here the formed piece of chicken coated up very nicely with a little bit of spicing just a little bit nice and crispy nice and crunchy underneath that just the very bottom of the biscuit very very basic guys two main ingredients but it does look and smell pretty tasty I have to admit this is the McChicken biscuit here at McDonald's let's peep out this flavor so are you a fan of high-quality delicious looking food reviews well if so definitely hit that subscribe button down below you don't forget to tap that Bell icon so you could be notified as soon as new content drops every week now let's dive into this one yeah this biscuit is definitely buttery and now that I'm finally holding it I'm finding that it's about the same thickness as the chicken mcgriddles that I reviewed recently take a look at that review popping up on your screen right now if you haven't seen it already but I'm really diggin the thickness so far and the smell is pretty awesome here we go it's the McChicken biscuit here McDonald's mmm ooo there is a crazy amount of butter in the batter of this biscuit right now this is probably so horrible for me but the flavor is amazing on it as you'd expect it to be that fried chicken from the McChicken itself very familiar and it really is delicious with the butteriness of the biscuit wow this is really a tasty tasty sandwich right now guys one more bite let's go for that close up right after mmm scratch that will be going for at least two more bites of this one and I can honestly see why this one is very popular especially at McDonald's in the south where it's more readily available really glad this one's available here even though unofficially you can have this made very easily the flakiness and the butteriness of that buttermilk biscuit goes amazingly well with the coating and the semi juiciness of the chicken patty itself it's very simple but the combination is hearty and it just works and hey FYI once in a while for breakfast I do enjoy the bacon egg and cheese biscuit here at McDonald's so naturally that biscuit is just on point to begin with there it goes amazingly well with those ingredients but the crispiness and the fried goodness of the McChicken I have to admit really takes this to a new level and it's different maybe because I haven't really done it before until now but I'm definitely gonna be going for this again even if they take this one off the menu I'm still getting this one made guys because the quality of the biscuit and the McChicken itself is a really tasty combination just delicious stuff so let's see if we can do a 360 on this one guys it's buttery it's flaky it's got the fried crispy goodness of the McChicken and as I'm spinning this around pieces are falling everywhere but guys I have to admit I love the quality of what we've got here and like I said the combination of that butteriness and the fried goodness of the McChicken goes extremely well and of course the buttermilk recipe of the biscuit highlights this one guys really nice combination I'm so glad I've got my napkins set up underneath my camera that could have been a lot worse than it actually turned out to be but guys honestly a very simple recipe on this one the combination works extremely well as you've heard me say and the quality of what you're getting especially when you get it fresh is pretty awesome the flakiness and the buttery that biscuit really is an amazing situation and pairing that up with the McChicken is a really nice combination so again I can see why it's very popular in the south and I'm glad I finally gave it a shot pretty cool so with that said I'm gonna have to give them a chicken biscuit here at McDonald's a rock-solid 9 out of 10 that simple ingredients list really translated into a very delicious hearty sandwich and honestly guys even if you don't have this one officially available to you definitely have them unofficially make it it's worth your time to try it at least once now the question is are you gonna try it drop some comments down below is this
