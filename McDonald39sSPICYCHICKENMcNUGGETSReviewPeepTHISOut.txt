 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty all right everyone let's get it it's Ian K back again with another high quality foodie feature for you here on peep this out reviews this time over at mcdonald's to check out one truly heated upgrade to the iconic chicken mcnuggets that mcdonald's has never attempted here in the U.S. until right now so let's check him out it's the spicy chicken mcnuggets and i gotta say presentation is always key and this one definitely has a very nice presentation take a look at that tempura style coating on the outside and if you look very carefully it's looking a little red guys it's actually tinged with hints of cayenne and chili peppers and i gotta say it's looking really really nice of course the 100% white meat chicken is underneath that and i'm thinking it's going to combine as awesome as it always does with that coating and that heat element and for dipping take a look at the mighty hot sauce this is going to be pretty nice to add even more to it it's a blend of spicy chilis crushed red peppers and garlic so i'm looking forward to really giving this a shot here guys this is going to be a lot of fun it's the all new spicy chicken mcnuggets here at mcdonald's let's peep out this flavor yeah these really look pretty cool and considering chicken mcnuggets are 39 years old this year guys if you can imagine that 39 years ago they debuted in 1981 before going worldwide in 1983 it's nice to know that that iconic flavor has never really changed but they've never done anything on the outside in terms of putting something into the coating so i'm really excited to see exactly what this is gonna do overall and hopefully that's coming through on the camera right there but there's definitely some red tinge to it and it looks really really cool i have to admit okay so real quick and like always before we get started if you guys are fans of high quality delicious looking food reviews make sure to

very excited let's do it yeah there it is i'm getting a little bit of cayenne right away but you don't really notice it until you swallow it believe it or not as i was kind of chewing it up just a bit there i'm like okay this tastes like a regular chicken mcnugget but there it comes there's a little bit of heat a little bit of sizzle it's actually building slightly but as you guys can see that crispy coating is lovely it's the iconic flavor that you already know from the chicken mcnugget but with a little bit of heat thrown into the mix it's nothing crazy but it's definitely got some heat to it and i'm digging that just on their own without sauce it's pretty good yeah that's pretty good it's keeping the essence of what a chicken mcnugget is naturally that iconic flavor but with a little bit of heat thrown into the mix so really really nice on this one guys really really nice and considering a few years back they switched over to all white meat i think it was 2003 when they did that previous versions of the chicken mcnuggets actually had dark meat thrown into the mix and i remember in 1981 actually trying these the very first time with my grandfather and i'll never forget it because they've been a favorite of mine ever since trying it with a little bit of heat without a sauce element i gotta admit i'm really liking that so if you just want to pop these while you're driving without having to dip it into something to heat them up you've got that option because it's actually in the coating so pretty nice all right so speaking of sauces i'm sure you guys want to see it and i definitely want to try it the mighty hot sauce i'm definitely digging that foil coating on the outside there looking really really good so let's give this a shot really quick and see how this is going to be it's got a nice look to it here almost like a really deep cayenne ketchup actually is what it kind of has here take a look at that supposedly crushed red peppers and garlic in this with some spicy chilis so a little bit of a heated situation here guys let's give it a shot ooo yup that's noticeably stronger wow i like that a little bit of extra sizzle going with the coating of the chicken mcnugget as well wow this is good you can really taste more of the red pepper and the chilies than anything else garlic i don't know about maybe a little hint in the background but i am really digging the essence of what this is adding oh wow it's really kicking in you notice it more when you swallow it than anything else guys initially while you're eating it maybe from anything previous you'll get it but when you swallow it you notice it right away but very vibrant on this mighty hot sauce that is really nice oh wow hang on one second yeah definitely some heat on this for sure let me show this to you again this is actually very very nice guys really nice compliment to this and i'm kind of glad they didn't kind of wimp out and just say we'll give you a special type of ranch sauce to cool it down they're adding a one-two punch with this one here because of the heat actually on the chicken mcnugget as well as the sauce itself so pretty nice combination yeah it goes amazingly well with it really really nice okay i'm actually glad i got a couple of those because i know the wifey is definitely going to want to give that a shot so just to round this one out before we give it a rating take a look at this here nice crispy coating on the outside and everything on the inside guys is exactly the same with the addition of cayenne and chili peppers so very nice upgrade to the classic chicken mcnugget and of course with the nice quality of the 100% white meat chicken as you'd expect here it is exactly what you would expect from a chicken mcnugget with some nice heat thrown into the mix and of course adding that sauce with it that mighty hot sauce is a nice capper to it nicely done so with that said i'm gonna have to give the all-new spicy mcnuggets here at mcdonald's a pretty rock solid 9.5 out of 10 the only complaint that i have with it and it's pretty much the same complaint i've had throughout the years is that i wish there was just a little bit more meat on the inside as you guys probably saw throughout the review it's a little on the small side with a lot of coating but still very very tasty for what it is and that heat absolutely delivers all right so now the obvious question for all you spice heads out there how excited are you to give the chicken mcnuggets a shot over here at mcdonald's with a little bit of kicked up heat especially with that sauce are you super excited to give these a go drop those comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K closing out another high quality foodie feature for you here on peep this
