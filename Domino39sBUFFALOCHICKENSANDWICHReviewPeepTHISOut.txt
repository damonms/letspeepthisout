 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty hey everyone welcome back to another high quality  foodie feature for you here in the channel where   this time i'm back on over at domino's to go  in on another selection off of their oven baked   sandwich menu and this one's hopefully going to  be delivering some heat so without further ado you   already know it's a buffalo chicken sandwich and  already we're being greeted by a very nice toasted   artisan bread situation guys looking pretty nice  with a little bit of cheddar caramelized on the   top there as well let's pop it and take a look  underneath and what you're gonna find is a laundry   list of ingredients starting off with white meat  chicken we've got some bleu cheese sauce shredded   mozzarella provolone cheddar cheese hot buffalo  sauce and onions and guys it is looking pretty   decadent very stringy in the cheese department  and that cheddar is really standing out and again   the toastiness of that bread is looking really  really fantastic can't wait to get into this one   so let's do just that this is the buffalo chicken  oven baked sandwich here at domino's let's peep   out this flavor well it is crazy bright outside  right now guys and considering the intensity   of the light i'm really hoping that's going to  transfer into some intensity in flavor because   the vibrancy i'm getting from the buffalo sauce  on this is transferring nicely you can really   smell it out here let me take a look on the inside  real quick for you just to show you as we got leaf   blowers coming into effect right now this is going  to be a very interactive review for me right now   let's give this a shot this is the buffalo  chicken sandwich here at domino's let's do it cheesy goodness right up front  oh yeah actually that's all i'm   really getting with this one right  now is pretty heavy cheddar cheese   with the buffalo sauce which it's got some heat  to it it's not so bad but the chicken so far seems   a little non-existent to me let's go for another  bite and i'll give you a close-up but so far this   feels like a very heavily cheesy based sandwich  with some buffalo sauce let's get going in all right so let me ask you do you see chicken  into this at all this is really feeling like a   very heavily based cheese sandwich melted mind  you it's good with some buffalo sauce but i'm   not really getting too much of anything else with  this i mean the toastiness of the bread is good   but i'm not really feeling any of the chicken on  the inside whatsoever let's just keep going in   yeah so far i'm not too impressed with this  i mean there's a little bit of chicken on   the bottom of this but it's mostly cheese and  buffalo sauce a little bit of the bleu cheese   which is not really doing it for me but the  toastiness of the bread is pretty awesome   and again the caramelization that i'm getting  from those cheddar edges slightly on the top of it   are pretty good as well let's go for a couple  more bites but guys this is just all right barely yeah i'm pretty surprised with this one already  i mean when i popped the top for the initial   close-up it looked like there was a lot of  goodness mixed together with the chicken on the   bottom but although there is chicken there it's  very very light and it's more of a cheese show   with buffalo sauce than anything else but guys i  love the toastiness of the bread it's definitely   banging and again a nice crispiness that you  can kind of see if it focuses in right there   not too bad in that department but overall i am  not feeling the fact that this doesn't really   feel like this is a buffalo chicken it's more  like a buffalo grilled cheese sandwich if you   ask me let's go for one more bite we'll close  this one out after the rating guys but honestly   this is just all right i'm definitely not  getting this one again but i'm glad to have   given this one a shot for you because we're  scratching this one off their oven baked   sandwich selections here at domino's so one  more bite we'll close this one out hang on   all right so let me give you a look at the other  half here because there's really not too much else   to see on this one guys not a lot of chicken but  there is plenty of cheese plenty of buffalo sauce   but there is really nothing else the toastiness of  the bread is awesome but this really needs to be   advertised as a buffalo grilled cheese sandwich  over here because there's not much else on it   guys just okay on this one barely well i apologize  for all the noise in the background of this one   guys and let me also apologize for how this  sandwich looked right now i had such high hopes   for how this was going to go considering the  pictures that i saw online of it and it looked   pretty decent i mean i like buffalo sauce i  like chicken of course i like melted cheese   the toasted artisan bread was pretty banging on  it but aside from all that it was missing a lot of   the main star of the show which should have been  the white meat chicken a grilled cheese sandwich   in effect with that one there with buffalo sauce  that's pretty much it so with that said i'm gonna   have to give the quote-unquote buffalo chicken  sandwich here at domino's a pretty lackluster   5 out of 10 and it only gets points like i said for  the melted cheese and the toasted artisan bread   and the flavor of the buffalo is awesome but guys  aside from that there is nothing else really of   value to that and i wouldn't spend $7.99 like i  did on this one right now give this one a shot   definitely pass on it but of course as for the  backup question if you are going to give this   one a go based upon what you've seen here right  now what did you personally think of it drop some   comments down below what are your thoughts on this  buffalo chicken sandwich over here at domino's and   what did you think of the quality of the buffalo  sauce because for me personally i liked the little   zip that it had on it it definitely had some heat  but what did you think of the overall quality   drop some comments down below and definitely let  me know and with that this is Ian K closing out   another high quality foodie feature for you here  on peep this out reviews bringing you brand new   content every single week here on my channel so  while you stay tuned for that next review coming real   soon in the meantime stay frosty all right guys  it looks like we've got the mediterranean veggie   as the final sandwich to take a look at over here  at domino's so watch for that one very soon all   right everyone until next time i'll talk to you  then hey thanks for checking out another one of   my reviews but just in case you didn't see the one  before this one you
