 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty hey everyone I'm back out at this time in the livestream studio and as promised here's the video I told you I was going to make a couple of weeks ago actually on livestream taking a look at the all-new coke energy zero sugar now I thought you know what I can easily just do a quickie review give you a rating give you my thoughts on it and call it a day but I thought I'd actually compare it with the regular coke zero sugar to see if there's actually a taste difference which is actually gonna be better naturally with this one having a little bit more caffeine the energy version from coke apparently has guarana which is actually a Brazilian shrub believe it or not they actually derived the seeds from that and it's pretty much used as a tonic or stimulant so that in combination with the regular B vitamins and the caffeine is gonna take this one over the top I'm sure just so you guys know the caffeine level on this one is actually 114 milligrams per can so that's pretty high the regular Coke Zero it is 57 milligrams so obviously we've got about half the caffeine in this one but I guess the concern is is there gonna be a taste difference between them so I thought I'd give this one a shot I've actually got some tea right over here just to kind of clean the palate as we go but let's start off with this here guys this actually is a very cool can obviously it has got the whole energy vibe going for it these tall thin skinny cans here looks like we've got about 12 ounces on this one really cool because I love the design of it there it's definitely got the iconic coke labeling and zero sugar on the top let's give this one a quick taste and see it is frosty we're definitely staying frosty with the coke energy wow it's got a strong coke aroma that blast already is coming out my face here already let's give this a shot and see how the quality of the flavor is gonna be I'll clean the palate we'll try the regular Coke Zero and I'll tell you there's really a taste difference so you know between them let's just see it coke energy zero sugar why is that like a little bitter to me for some reason well obviously with the extra stuff in this here guarana trying to say that ten times fast I don't know about you that may be what's giving it a little bit of a yeah it's a little bit of a bitter taste on this actually hmm it's refreshing though I mean naturally with zero sugar it's got that fake feel to it but it does have a little bit of the back end being more of the classic coke flavor it's actually not bad I'm kind of liking it I want to say it's a little bit of a berry like taste that I'm getting with this one here this is not the cherry version of it by the way it's just the standard one I wanted to get as close to the regular Coke Zero as possible let's go for it again I like it it's definitely um feeling like it's got something a little extra in it naturally with the B vitamin goodness and everything in there as well caffeine wise I'll probably have to let you know in social media or on the next stream if my face is gonna be freaking out for it because I'm full of caffeine that this has got one more sip of this one I'll give you just a generic rating because I like it it's not bad and then we'll go in with the regular Coke Zero after I clean the palate one more shot it's good it's definitely a an alternative to a regular sugary coke naturally because of what it's got overall flavor I don't think it's gonna be as strong as that you know what before I give you the rating let me give you the flavor taste on the regular Coke Zero and then I'll let you know exactly which is gonna be the best that's probably gonna influence exactly what I'm gonna really truly think about this one here so with that said a little tea clean the palate works wonders you guys should do that after any meal if you really want to get all those tastes of whatever you're eating out of your mouth actually works well Coke Zero this is definitely a blast to do you guys haven't seen my comparison between the old Coke Zero and this new formula I'll definitely post that it's gonna be popping up on your screen over here right now take a look at that if you want to see the on location version of that I should say it's a lot of fun to do let's give it a shot first with this and then we'll see how it compares yeah definitely more subdued and I'm not getting any type of berry like feeling compared to the other one there that definitely has something else in it guys the coke energy obviously with these extra ingredients um it's a little bit of a different flavor even though it's a standard coke but it definitely feels like it's got something extra in it there the regular Coke Zero yeah it's pretty much like the fake version of coke I like it because it's actual ittle bit sweeter than Diet Coke so this is really kind of like my go-to if I'm gonna have one of these once in a while aside from that I like the Mexican cokes the bottled cokes that's my favorite but if I'm gonna go for a zero coke option honestly I'm still gonna stick with the regular coke zero sugar guys because I think this one actually has a better type of aftertaste that's a lot closer to regular coke naturally with the caffeine being half of what it is it is what it is actually because of what it's trying to be but when it comes to the energy version of it I see what they're doing with this one here and naturally selling the coke type of flavor with all of this extra stuff and actually having the stimulants the caffeine this is really kind of the market for that it is kind of cool for that reason alone just not me particularly probably wouldn't get this again personally but if I have to rate it which I'm going to for you right now I'd probably give it like a 7.5 out of 10 it's way above average cuz the flavor is similar to coke very similar but not quite if that makes sense there but decent for what it is now of course the obvious question is what do you guys personally think of the coke energy zero sugar do you think this one's actually better than the standard sugar should have maybe tried that one compared to regular coke I think it might have been similar but drop some comments down below let me know what you think of this one in particular and which one is your favorite have you tried to zero sugar as well as the one with and if you personally had to choose which would you prefer drop those comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K closing out another episode of peep this out bringing you brand new content every single week here on my channel so while you stay tuned for that next review coming real soon in the meantime stay frosty whoa whoa whoa but before you go and just in case you haven't already take a look at the last review that I put out right up over here along with what I think YouTube's gonna
