returning to taco bell because they've got a brand new freeze on the menu and i gotta admit i am digging the name of this one feast your eyes on the dragon fruit freeze and it looks to be delivering the frosty goods feast your eyes on all the icy goodness here guys this is mixed actually with dragon fruit flavored syrup and i'm really digging the color tone on this one it's almost like a pinkish purplish hue very refreshing looking yeah definitely a very cool presentation as it's beginning to melt already so let's not waste any more time but real quick and like always if you guys are fans of

week guys the dragon fruit freeze brand new here at taco bell let's do it right away this is already simulating the flavors of what dragon fruit is which is actually a combination of kiwi and pear for those of you who don't know this is actually very very close to that i got to admit it's nice oh yeah yeah that's really nice and again the color tone on this is really really awesome you can't really tell right away as it begins to focus in but it's got that pinkish purplish type of swirl all throughout here and i'm really digging that it really really is very nice very similar in color to what a dragon fruit is and also if you're wondering why dragon fruit is on the menu over here at taco bell dragon fruit is actually indigenous to mexico and central america so you can kind of see where that fits on the menu here at taco bell given the theme of what taco bell is so pretty nice on this one that is really refreshing and again a lot more pear it's very sweet and as i'm beginning to go further in right now i'm feeling more and more parched actually because of how sweet it is but it's refreshing as it's going down it's pretty awesome and as you can see on the very bottom there is that simulated color tone that's in there now granted there is no fruit juice in here so this is all artificial but still very very tasty very refreshing very icy very frosty and you already know what it is guys very good i am digging this and you can't beat it on happy hour right now this is a buck not bad for the size very very solid i thought this would be the perfect opportunity to swing over and give this one a try just in case if i didn't like it i mean how could i not it's cold it's sweet i knew it was gonna be decent but for a dollar you can't hate on that that is really really nice so one more quickie close up it's just nice frosty goodness on the inside all the icy goodness that you know from the freezes here at taco bell but very very nice simulated version of dragon fruit with that kiwi and the pear flavor combo so i'm really digging that it's nice it really is i'm probably going to be getting this one again off of happy hour and i think that's the main reason why they do that guys because they want you to try these for a buck and if you really like it you're going to come back and get maybe the medium or the large I'll rock that one again it's actually pretty good and honestly although as good as it is it's not my absolute favorite i've done so many of the freezes over the years here at taco bell take a look at the playlist popping up on your screen here right now for proof of all of that but i gotta say the pineapple whip freeze is still gonna be my favorite right now but this is very very tasty so with that said i'm gonna have to give the dragon fruit freeze brand new here at taco bell a pretty rock solid 8 out of 10 guys it's frosty it's cold it tastes very refreshingly delicious and i gotta say overall with the flavor being very close to dragon fruit if you guys are fans of that in general it even looks the part because of the color tone which i really like actually minus little seeds on the inside but that combination of the pear and the kiwi is very pronounced especially with the pear flavor so pretty rock solid all right so now the obvious question because i think most of you know what's coming right are you going to be giving this one a shot drop some comments down below first and foremost are you a fan of dragon fruit if you had it in the past and if you've had this actually already how close is it to that flavor to you drop those
