 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty hey everyone I'm back at it cheaters cam style after hours here at McDonald's to round out their world favorites menu because since I've done all the other main courses I think it's time for a little dessert so let's go in and a stroopwafel McFlurry and already this one is beginning to melt very quickly hear that very familiar vanilla soft serve from all the McFlurry's is on display for you you've got some caramel goodness in here as well basically what this is guys is a treat from the Netherlands featuring Daelman's stroopwafel crispy caramel waffle cookie pieces mixed into the McFlurry goodness that you see here that vanilla soft serve and there's more caramel goodness to go with let me give you a little bit of a closer look here it looks like this mixing straw which they actually use for all the McFlurry's here to mix this one up is very nicely coated with that caramel and of course the vanilla soft serve goodness here let's give this one a go and see how it's gonna be guys this is almost a milkshake at this point it's the stroopwafel McFlurry here at McDonald's let's peep out this flavor well hopefully I saved the best for last because I'm definitely a fan of McFlurry's especially the Oreo variety here at McDonald's it's actually one of my favorites so I have high hopes for this one right now but before I get into it as always if you're a fan of high quality delicious looking food reviews make sure you hit the subscribe button down below and don't forget to tap the Bell icon so you can be notified as soon as new content drops every week now let's get into this one before it becomes even more from milkshake than it's already becoming here this actually looks really tasty still guys it's the stroopwafel McFlurry from the Netherlands worldwide favorites here at McDonald's Oh mmm bomb straight bomb oh my god mmm the authentic daelman stroopwafel caramel waffle pieces think of them like waffle cone pieces kind of crushed up and mixed in and then you have a caramel swirl that's all throughout this right now you know this is almost like a milkshake already because it melts very quickly but guys what I am picking up is very chunky in that department with the caramel pieces and the caramel swirl and it is just heavenly it's the vanilla soft serve that you already know from the McFlurry but this is straight-up bomb right now guys it really is mmm Wow really good I'm gonna try and hold this as close as I can and maybe zoom up just a little bit here guys but the caramel is beginning to clump up on the waffle pieces themselves and that's what makes it such a huge highlight on top of the vanilla itself very very decadent guys if you're a fan of anything caramel this is easily on your radar if you haven't had this already I highly recommend it very very tasty but get to it quick because for some reason this is melting a lot quicker than it should and I'm doing this at night right now there's no excuse for that but still very delicious guys look how chunky that looks right there that is just ridiculous here we go again mmm Oh so much waffle goodness and the caramel and it's sticking in the very back man any of you guys have braces be careful this is crazy crazy sticky but delicious Wow really really good mmm I'm almost getting a little bit of a cinnamon vibe with this as well that caramel is coming through nicely but as I'm chewing this more and more and focusing on those flavors it's got a little bit more of a cinnamon type of hit that I'm getting which is really really nice as well it may not have cinnamon physically in it but my mind is telling me this is cinnamon right now a lots of caramel guys and of course that rich creamy goodness from the vanilla soft serve delicious mmm definitely diggin that chunky caramel goodness mixed in with a soft serve on this one guys really really good and I like the fact that they have a little bit around the sides here because I can scoop just a little bit more just to kind of get it ready and then go into it a little bit more of that soft-serve and go for one more little scoop here before we give it a rating mmm do you think you know what I'm gonna give this score wise it's gonna be pretty high well let's not keep in suspense too much longer guys the stroopwafel McFlurry one of the worldwide favorites here McDonald's is gonna get a rock-solid 9 out of 10 and the only reason it's not a perfect 10 out of 10 is because this is actually more of a milkshake that they gave me here right now it's not really holding its own the McFlurry as I've had in the past tend to be a little bit firmer and I'm doing this at night right now there's really no excuse that it should be this watery but what I am getting in terms of the chunkiness of it is awesome but guys delicious either way I would highly recommend it to you if you're a fan of McFlurry's anyway this needs to be on your radar it is really delicious so now I got to ask you after what you've just seen and heard right now are you gonna give this one a shot drop some comments down below are you gonna give the stroopwafel McFlurry a shot over here at McDonald's and if you've had any of the other worldwide favorites which are your favorites drop some comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K closing out another
