let's peep this out so here we go with the grande stacker box here at taco bell along with a promo to help kick off the launch of the xbox series x and this is not a bad set of goodies we've got in front of us here starting off on the side we've got two crunchy tacos and i think most of you should know what's in those pretty much they're seasoned beef we've got some lettuce and some cheese and then naturally that taco shell two of them here over to the side you've got a medium or large drink in order to qualify for that free xbox series x or to give it a shot i should say in this case i've got a medium diet pepsi and for the main star of the show the grande stacker itself basically an oversized flour tortilla that's folded over twice to pretty much look like a tortilla chip on the inside we've got plenty of seasoned beef a three cheese blend and nacho cheese sauce and i gotta say it definitely looks pretty hefty and absolutely oversized so let's see how the flavor is going to be on this one we'll focus primarily on this one for sure it's the grande stacker box here at taco bell let's peep out this flavor all right so as you probably noticed through the drive-through my local taco bell doesn't have this promo for five dollars as nationally advertised it is what it is $5.99 over here in southern cali but i do have to admit what you are getting is pretty sizable guys even still it actually looks pretty decent there especially with the tacos now granted i have a kind of positioned in the box and it's kind of filling it out but even still that grande stacker does look pretty big so at least it lives up to its name because of the size of what it is so naturally we're going to get into that but real quick and like always if you guys are fans of high quality delicious looking food reviews make sure to hit that subscribe button down below and don't forget to tap that bell icon so you can be notified as soon as brand new content drops every week guys let's do this i have a feeling i know exactly what i'm in for with this here pretty much the same basic ingredients the taco bell is known for but just very basic this time out but as you can see nicely grilled this really feels like an oversized beef quesadilla that they flip over twice to make the shape that you see here so let's give it a shot it's the grande stacker here at taco bell i'm gonna go right in the very tip right over here let's do it actually almost had a problem there that meat is a lot more concentrated at the very tip here that's crazy but it's still very dense and there's lots of cheese obviously going at the very end over there it's all going to be concentrated but guys take a look at that on the inside as you can see a nice representation of all the seasoned beef the three cheese blend the nacho cheese sauce we're not reinventing the wheel here it's pretty much the same taco bell goodness but a heavy amount of it and i gotta say grande definitely fits with this item let's go for another bite that's thick let me get a little closer so you can see the folds of that tortilla in there as you can see it is absolutely stacked over here guys it really folds over pretty nicely this is really like i said not inventing the wheel over here at taco bell but it's the flavor that you know and love with a heavy amount of that beef and cheese goodness on this one and again i'm digging the fact that the name is stacker i wish there was just a little bit more in here to make it more stacked but again an overabundance of beef is not a bad thing and the cheese the flavor that you know definitely satisfying because of what this is and as i'm going further into this right now let me grab a quick sip of the actual drink that comes with this here in my case it's going to be diet pepsi i know a lot of you purists out there are going to say why didn't you get baja blast diet pepsi is actually really good over here at taco bell it's the only place i like to get it because the flavor is a lot richer compared to others where i've tried it so definitely digging that really nice and hopefully the code on this cup will actually net me an xbox series x because apparently every 15 minutes you can win one and that's only if you get a medium drink or a large drink or jump on over to the website that i'll have down in the description you can pretty much try it for free but guys not bad for what this is obviously it really is the taco bell that you know and love there's really not too much else to say about this but i have to admit this really does kind of feel like just a value item even though the size is decent on it there's really not too much on the inside except just beef and cheese and that's cool but it's lacking just a little bit of something extra maybe a little sour cream considering the price of what this is like i said i love the value of what you're getting here because the size is good but there could be just a little bit more thrown into it for the money but still very tasty all right and because this combo comes with them we've got a couple of tacos over here so i figured i'd go for just a quick bite you know what let's go for a little bit of that fire sauce action there we'll put a little bit of that in there and give this a shot you know with two of these crunchy tacos being closer to the three dollar range and when you throw in that medium drink there maybe $4.50 or so it's still not a bad deal even at $5.99 considering the amount of food here like i said i only wish there was just a little bit of extra thrown into that grande stacker but the overall value of what you're getting even at the elevated price point is still halfway decent guys let's go for a quick bite on this one classic taco bell yeah that fire sauce works extremely well and of course we're getting more of that beefy goodness on the very bottom here guys so lots of crunchy lettuce in here a decent amount of cheese and of course that nice corn tortilla on the outside decent situation with this but we came to do more of the other so let's swing back on over to that grande stacker here so just to round this one out guys as you can see it's taco bell that you know and love there's really no difference with this compared to the others a lot of tortilla on this one and like i said i wish this had just a little bit more thrown into the mix but what you're getting here is very very thick kind of reminds me of the crunchwrap a little bit if this was toasted more with some lettuce but i gotta say guys still very tasty all right maybe more like that folded beef quesadilla like i said in the very beginning because there's nothing crunchy on the inside of that but the heft of it kind of feels like that crunchwrap supreme it's got that denseness to it and you'll know it when you pick it up so with that said i'm gonna have to give the grande stacker box here a taco bell a decent 7 out of 10 like i said all throughout this review this is not reinventing the wheel at all and considering the value being halfway decent with what you're getting in this box it's not bad two of those tacos in the drink alone are pretty much close to the four or five dollar range and you're getting a decent sized value type of item i gotta say thrown into the mix there with an oversized tortilla so decent for what it is like i said i wish there was just a little bit of extra on the inside for the money but even still what you're getting for the money it's not bad all right now i've got two very simple questions for you first and foremost are you going to be giving this one a shot drop some comments down below let me know what you thought of this one in general and if you're enticed to give this a go aside from the xbox promo and speaking of that xbox promo are you going to be getting an xbox series x even if you don't win one or you more of a ps5 type of person drop those comments down below and definitely let me know and with that
