 hey everyone welcome and welcome back to the  channel it's Ian K where today i'm over a good   old bk to take a look at one of the three new  items they have available on their menu for   a limited time only that's right so stay  tuned because the whopper melt is up next   welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty all right so get ready for it because this  thing is already living up to its name guys   feast your eyes on the whopper melt this thing  looks absolutely awesome tons of cheese tons of   caramelized onions on this one and obviously guys  it is looking very gluttonous just look at this   thing let's break it on down all right so starting  us off what we've got here is some toasted bread   and underneath it guys plenty of caramelized  onions and stacker sauce there's a lot of it on   here but as we pan down you're gonna see buried  amongst all the american cheese is two whopper   junior patties equaling a total of a quarter pound  of beef it looks a little on the small side but   guys it is decked out with cheese and it really  looks absolutely delicious the aroma in my car   right now is straight up cheese and stacker sauce  and again the presentation is absolutely killer   talk about living up to its name right so let's  not waste any more time on this one this is the   all-new whopper melt here at bk let's peep out  this flavor yes sir this is definitely checking   off the boxes of aroma and absolute presentation i  have to say this is looking really really awesome   and aside from the fact that this feeling like  a little bit of a small sandwich because it   does feel like it looks kind of small too guys the  thickness of it is definitely on point so without   further ado finally let's do it it's the all-new  whopper melt here at bk let's peep this out oh heavy heavy cheese and beef mmm all right  well first off don't let the toasted bread fool   you because the appearance of it looks like it's  toasted but it does feel fairly soft when i go   into it i don't think you heard any crunch there  and i didn't feel any but guys take a look at this   definitely a meaty situation they're the small  patties for the whopper over here at bk but man   the thickness is on point the cheese is on  point the light sweetness of that stacker   sauce and there is plenty of caramelized onions  guys very gluttonous and very tasty as you'd   expect it to be it looks fantastic and it  tastes pretty awesome let's keep going in you know it's been a minute since i've had stacker  sauce and while i originally kind of feel like   it's their version of big mac sauce over here  at bk it's a little bit on the sweeter side so   you're definitely getting that immediately up  front right after the girth and the beefiness   that you're getting with the mouth feel and  guys i have to say again with the cheesy action   this is more than living up to its name it is  very very gluttonously cheesy and the caramelized   onions are adding a nice dimension of flavor  definitely digging this yeah this is definitely   a banger of an option over here at bk and it  really feels distinctly different because it's   not a regular king burger it's a smaller version  of the king burgers the whopper junior patties   but what they're doing with it is definitely  a banging situation and real quick let me send   a shout out over to jesus and the tortilla aka  the stupid food review show because he actually   checked this one out when it was testing in  his area a couple of months ago and i'm so   glad that all of us now have the ability to give  this one a shot nationwide definitely delicious   stuff so let's go for another couple of bites on  this one guys like i said it's very gluttonous   very flavorful and you'd expect nothing less from  meat cheese and caramelized onions with a special   sauce and again on semi-toasted bread at least  in the appearance department let's keep going it you know for some of you peeps who think bk really  lathers their burgers up with mayo they absolutely   lathered this up with that stacker sauce it  is adding such a flavorful dimension but again   elevated sweetness on top of the caramelized  onions and the light oiliness that i'm getting   from that along with the melted cheese and of  course that flame grilled beef over here guys i   haven't had a whopper junior in a minute either  these are actually pretty good they're a little   bit more of an upper scale version of a value  patty but when you have a quarter of a pound total   with this one with these two together definitely a  lovely situation indeed just delicious stuff guys   i keep telling you guys throughout this review  because it really is it's freaking delicious   all right all right enough of that for right  now let's go for one more final bite on this   one before we wrap the review up with the  rating coming up next but guys the whopper   melts are no joke this is definitely a serious  situation what looks kind of small initially   when you unwrap it really delivers in  the thickness and the overall flavor   pretty bagging let's go for one more  bite and we'll close it up hang on well if ever there was a burger that really  deserved a burger diaper this is definitely one   of them guys this really needs to have something  to protect you in the back because there's plenty   of caramelized onions plenty of that stacker  sauce that's going to fall out on you here you   got to be careful have a lot of napkins but what  you're going to get is something very flavorful   and totally worthy of that melt name  this is definitely a banging situation   and something very delicious if you love  meat and cheese which i'm willing to bet   it's pretty much just about all of you  guys watching this right now pretty awesome   wow guys talk about a hyper mini double  cheeseburger the addition of caramelized   onions and that stacker sauce really takes this  one up a notch and i really like the touch of   having the bread being just instead of the  standard bun you're getting some toasted bread   even though it doesn't really feel like toasted  bread it looks like toasted bread but it feels   almost like a sourdough type of burger when  you're eating it even though it doesn't have   the sourdough bread the presentation and the  overall mouth feel and the flavor is just off   the charts so an easy recommendation to give this  one a shot it really is classic bk and like i said   it lives up to that melt name so for this version  of the whopper mouth i'm gonna have to give it a   pretty rock solid 9 out of 10 like i said it's  classic bk it's vintage bk and especially with all   those flavors being very timeless over here the  addition of that stacker sauce and caramelized   onions that's the wild card to really elevate this  one flavor-wise what you're gonna get otherwise   is a pretty decent value for what you've got  there in terms of the meat department it's a   quarter pound of beef with plenty of cheese to go  with guys but like i said it delivers and again   it's absolutely warranted to have that melt  name on the title definitely a banging situation   all right so you already know the other two  versions of these whopper melts are going   to be coming up here on the channel very very  soon so if you are going to be giving this one   a shot which i'd venture to guess you're probably  going to if you're this far into the review do me   a quick favor drop some comments down below what  are your initial thoughts of this one in general   and how was the experience for you drop those  comments down below and definitely let me know   and with that this is Ian K closing out another  high quality foodie feature for you here on
