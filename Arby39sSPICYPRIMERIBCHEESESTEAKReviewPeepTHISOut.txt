button down below and don't forget to tap that bell icon so you can be notified as soon as brand new content drops every week guys the spicy prime rib cheesesteak here at arby's let's do it that sauce is strong and here i thought it was going to be a little bit more like sriracha i mean the sauce itself is a little bit more watery but it's got like a kung pao type of vibe to it it's almost got an asian flair believe it or not but i gotta admit the flavor goes amazingly well and naturally with the meat on the inside let me keep that in the sun for you take a look at that there a lovely situation with the amount of meat right there guys a lovely situation indeed let's keep going in on this one so far pretty impressed the prime rib is definitely tender and the meltiness of that provolone goes amazing with it the combination of meat and cheese of course is going to be pretty amazing add in the fire roasted peppers a little bit of that spice action not so much onions really it's more of the peppers that i'm getting and the wateriness of that spicy sauce but it's got some punch to it so i really really like that but guys a very lovely situation so far and i love the fact like i said that i'm protected on the back because there is a lot of sauce on this a very liberal amount of goodness that they put on the sandwich here right now let's keep going and we'll give you some more close-ups but guys pretty tasty well make no mistake as tasty and spicy as that sauce is the stars of the show are easily going to be the prime rib and the provolone cheese and the sweetness that i'm getting from the roasted peppers in there guys it's just a very lovely situation here and as you can see a nice plentiful bite as you're diving into this you're really getting a lot of that melty cheesy goodness and i gotta admit it is very very tasty man this cheesesteak is already kind of leaking even with the diaper in the very back here guys i'm so glad i've got a bunch of napkins on my lap right now just to kind of catch it all right let's go for a little bit of that horsey sauce action how could you not get any of the meats over here at arby's and not do horsey right let's do it all right what do you say right over here let's load it up loveliness guys loveliness this is gonna be the best part i just know it oh and it is oh man wow that creamy horseradish bite along with the spicy sauce completely lights up the spicy prime rib cheesesteak guys that combination is lovely i mean the horseradish itself has a little bit of heat to begin with when you add in that almost asian type of flair that i'm getting from the spicy sauce with that on top of the meat on top of the provolone cheese and then the sweetness of those roasted peppers that's a lovely combination guys this is really amazing with horsey sauce obviously you got to pair that up you have to give this a shot with it it really elevates it nicely and as you can see just a lovely situation you know what i'm gonna go for one more because that was killer that was really killer let's do this again a little bit more quickly impromptu for you let's give it a shot that was just banging guys it really was man i'm telling you that just completely took it up to a whole new level for me right now i am so excited about the flavor of this because the horseradish with that spicy sauce and the way that it's kind of permeating in the back of my mouth right now along with the overall flavors of the prime rib and the cheese just a lovely combination guys lovely combination so one more bite we'll finish this one up after the rating but guys that is the way to experience this sandwich by far over here if you get the classic one you can go for that as well obviously no spice on that but add the horsey sauce because it completely makes the sandwich life-changing i'm telling you it's worth it one more bite we'll finish it up yeah i'm easily going to be back for this one and as you can see the combination of those peppers really adds a nice dimension in terms of sweetness and overall flavor to this along with that spicy sauce as well and of course guys the prime rib the plentiful amount of the provolone cheese the melted goodness and that sub roll really take this one up i just can't really taste the onions but honestly with the peppers who really cares this is just a delicious sandwich and easily a recommendation of course with that horsey sauce you know it's funny when i saw the sandwich was coming out it actually kind of looked a little familiar to me so when i looked at my back catalog here on the channel i actually did something called the fire roasted philly back in the day literally about four or five years ago so if you guys want to take a look at that take a look at that arby's playlist popping up on your screen right now but i got to say from what i remember of that one i think i did that one at night it was a cheaters cam review and honestly this one looked very very similar to that but naturally with the meat choice on this one the combination of that provolone cheese obviously added to it and just the overall spicy factor especially with the horsey it really feels like an all new sandwich and i gotta say i would easily come back for it again guys easily super delicious so with that said i'm gonna have to give the spicy prime rib cheesesteak here at arby's a rock solid 10 out of 10 this one was super flavorful right on the outset guys but once you add that horsey sauce into the mix you can already tell i'm spoojing over it right now because it's just so amazing i gotta say the combination is awesome and honestly horsey goes amazing with all the meats over here and naturally with what they specialize in how could you not give it a shot with it with this sandwich in particular definitely elevates it up and with the added heat with that spicy sauce and the horsey together that combination is a knockout really really solid all right so now the obvious question did this spicy prime rib cheesesteak sandwich here at arby's look pretty solid to you do me a quick favor drop some comments down below how amazing does this actually look to you right now based upon my review and if you are going to be giving this one a shot are you going spicy are you going to stay with that standard classic drop some comments down below and definitely let
