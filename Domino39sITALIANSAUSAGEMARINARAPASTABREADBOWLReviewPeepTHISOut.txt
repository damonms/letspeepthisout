 you already know what it is it's Ian K back at it for peep this out reviews this time over at Domino's because after checking out the Tuscani meaty marinara pasta pizza recently I definitely wanted to see what the competition had to offer and let's just say it's a little "carby" if you decide to go that route so stay tuned because the Italian sausage Marinara bread Bowl is up next welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty so here we go with the Italian sausage marinara bread bowl and I got to admit I am already diggin the thickness of that bowl itself there guys take a look at that it is pretty tall actually pretty wide as well almost looking like a super pizza on the very top here and filled in the middle looks like we've got some penne pasta topped up with a hearty marinara sauce and chunks of sausage lovely situation not the little bits these actually look legit we've got some shredded provolone cheese and I got to say guys that is it that's all you really need with this one but the presentation is killer that looks really really amazing just going around this it looks like the crust itself on the bread bowl itself is dusted and I am really digging that maybe some garlic goodness olive oil maybe but man that is looking really really good extremely hot right now especially in the car let's get into this and see if this one's gonna deliver the flavor I'm sure is gonna match the looks on this one it's the Italian sausage marinara bread bowl here at Domino's let's peep out this flavor you know I didn't know what to expect when I popped the box in this one but you guys got that experience along with me for the first time and I got to admit this pretty much looks like the picture that I was looking at online guys I mean look at that actually up close one more time there and try and focus that in for you that is a lot of Pizza looking goodness but in the middle they are filled with pasta that sauce the Italian sausage it's looking pretty fantastic alright so before I dive into this one to give you the goodness that I'm thinking this one's gonna deliver right now and like always if you guys are fans of high-quality delicious looking

too bad as well let me grab a little bit of that too I'm gonna bring this up and try and do this as delicately as I can and for you take a look at that nice penne goodness as I was going into this one here they definitely feel nice and firm let's give this a shot and see how it is over here at dominos hmm hmm that's bangin oh man the provolone cheese that this has got a little bit of pungentness that I'm getting from that it's definitely feeling like it's not mozzarella that's a nice combination light sweetness of the sauce itself and take a look at that marinara real quick there guys we get a little close for you it's nice and rich it's got a lot of rich tomatoey flavor and I'm not really a fan of tomato but when it's made like this I can get into the sauce but the chunks on this yeah that sausage is bangin let me bring this up closer again for ya look at that nicely seasoned the Italian seasoning is there it definitely feels very high-quality and I am just overall diggin the overall experience of what I'm having here so far mmm yeah that is awesome and the bowl itself like I said when I first saw this I was like could I get this in a dish you can obviously or the bread bowl and I figured the bread bowl would be a nice change over from the last thing I checked out from Pizza Hut and I got to admit I like the experience of having it this way I'm gonna get into that crust in just a second of the bowl itself now let me just tell you and I think you know it already this is very rich it's very hearty and the penne is a good choice with this actually I got to admit this is really really nice pseudo al dente they're a little on the softer side compared to what I was used to from Pizza Hut but this is nice guys and the presentation is beautiful I mean just look at that look at that focus in there it looks awesome in the box and I'm really diggin just the way everything is presenting to me right now solid hmm all right so for the bowl its up it looks like it is dusted with something I'm assuming it's parmesan here let me taste it real quick yeah that's parmesan but the pizza crust that I'm getting from this the toastiness of it the overall experience of having something like this in this fashion is really making me want to do this again and again and maybe try some of the other ones on here and as you can see they've got three other options aside from a build-your-own there's a chicken alfredo a pasta primavera and a chicken carbonara but as you can see I definitely had to go in in the Italian sausage because the version I tried from Pizza Hut was the beef version so naturally I wanted to keep it carnivores in this way so this is pretty close to what I had there but I have to admit the choice of noodles the sauce it's very similar but I am enjoying this one a lot more believe it or not and that's without even biting into this bowl just yet so speaking of that let's just have a little fun with this right now let me put this fork down real fast I'm just gonna bite into this really quick and take a look at that let me just lift this up for you right now guys look at that that is just really cool very toasty on the bottom there as you can see let me hold that up just a little bit but look at that that is just really cool let's go for a bite of the bread bowl and see if I can get a little bit of sausage in here as well to it let's go for that at the end here oh it is "carby" but mmm that parmesan and the garlic that I'm tasting in that oh let me go for more bite hang on mmm oh yeah I'm eating it like this that's crazy gluttonous doing it this way but let me swing this around in my hand here and bring this up for you guys look at the pizza crust goodness on this right there it's nice and doughy on the inside and crispy on the outside and a little bit of the cheese actually is spilling over in the very back on this one over here which is actually a lovely situation we have to go for a bite over there but man that is just really really tasty this bread bowl it's not ultra deep but it's wide and that's what I really really like about this and hopefully you guys are salivating like I am right now as I'm diving into this so let me go for one more bite of this one in the very back with the cheese right there but the quality is high on it it's super cool eating it this way even though it's very carb heavy and then we'll just finish this one out after the rating guys but this is pretty bangin it really is one more bite let's do it mmm that was a bite little bit of sausage provolone cheese yes alright one more close up just around this one out a very fun experience checking this out for the first time on camera guys and initially like I said I was concerned about how many carbs were gonna be in this and having pasta on top of bread but I loved the combination of the two because that sauce is so rich the provolone cheese is there and it very much reminds me of a really good pizza I got to admit the tastiness of the bowl itself for that Parmesan outer coating the garlic goodness in there this is definitely something to try at least once I would recommend it for you in the price not too bad considering what it is all right so let me just say as hot as that one's right now temperature-wise it is equally as hot if not hotter on the outside of my car it's closer to 90 plus degrees right now so this was definitely a glutton for punishment to do right now for the review but so much fun to do at the same time because that was just deliciously tasty the bowl itself was a real set off on that one I probably should have started off with a bite of that first and then dovetailed into the insides but regardless what is actually in that was super super delicious and as you saw a super chunky on that sausage as well I'm such a fan of those ripped whole pieces of sausage instead of the little bits and when you combine that with a semi al dente a little mushy for me in terms of the penne that was actually still very tasty on top of the marinara sauce being very flavorful on its own so with all that said I'm gonna have to give the Italian sausage marinara bread bowl very and here at Domino's are pretty rock-solid 9.5 out of 10 the only thing holding that one back from the perfect score was the noodles himself with that penne being a little on the mushy side but other than that super flavorful a decent amount of that shredded provolone cheese on top and like I said the presentation was bangin how could you not think that right all right now the obvious question since this one is a regular menu item have you ever personally had this one over here at Domino's drop those comments down below and if you have what about the other versions have you had any of those what did you think overall drop those comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K closing out another episode of peep this out bringing you brand new content every single
