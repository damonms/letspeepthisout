because the pastrami burger is up next welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty alright let's get it on it's the pastrami burger here at the hat and I am super excited to get into this one right now guys pastrami is one of my favorite meats for sure and this looks glorious as expected a lovely situation of that classic goodness falling out all over this burger starting off on the very top but that sesame seed bun let's take a look on the inside there you go guys they're world famous pastrami looking amazing and that's all sitting on top looks like a quarter pound patty here we've got some American cheese action right there as well grilled up on their flap top grills looking really really nice underneath that we've got all the basic stuff of the burger we've got the lettuce the tomato the pickles the onions we've got some Thousand Island dressing on the very bottom there let me see if I can go a little further in it is definitely on the bottom and guys it's the shredded lettuce too which is not bad but considering all the shredded goodness of this pastrami action right now this thing is ridiculous it definitely looks like it is worth the money it feels very substantial and I can't wait to get into this guys let's do that right now it's the pastrami burger here at the Hat in Pasadena California let's peep out this flavor man I'm about to take a bite of a gargantuan pastrami burger on literally a crispy day here in Southern Cali guys it's close to 100 plus degrees here right now and I can't believe I'm doing this thankfully I've got my little fan off to the side because I'm gonna need it but guys I think I'm sweating more because of how amazing this looks and I don't know how I'm gonna bite that look at the ridiculousness in front of you here right now lots of lean pastrami and everything to go with the beef patty this looks flat-out amazing this is my first time trying this by the way I've never had this here and I'm very excited to do just that but before I do in like always you guys are fans of high-quality delicious looking food reviews make sure to hit that subscribe button down below don't forget to tap that Bell icon so you

to you that is insane I got everything in that bite even the tomato on the very bottom destroyed everything that is flat-out awesome the saltiness is there the beef patty a little on the dry side but all the moisture from the pastrami is soaking into everything and guys all those pickles this is absolutely insane totally gluttonous right now and I am so glad that I'm doing this hot weather or not I don't really care this is freaking awesome let's go for another bite I'm gonna keep giving you these close-ups but guys it's as legendary as the pastrami is here just on top of that burger which is really really awesome so delicious stuff let's keep going mm-hmm all right that time I got the tomatoes so I am definitely getting rid of that right now because I am not feeling that whatsoever but you know what it's not deterring from the fact that the flavor on everything else is so insane and again the saltiness of that world famous pastrami as it is falling out all over the place here guys well worth the money on this one but guys I got to say everything else just works amazingly well with it you've got that nice charbroiled beef flavor really really decent and again even though it's a little on the dry side I like the fact that the moisture of everything else is really coming to the rescue the Thousand Island on the bottom the pickles the onions and naturally that tomato of course everything on this with the exception of the tomato is really really amazing so totally gluttonous totally carnivorous and guys like I said I'm so glad I'm finally cracking this one off the bucket list and doing it in style I think because this is really the way to do it this is the only way that they make it you could request no cheese naturally and I'm not really tasting it that much but the flavorfulness of that pastrami is what's standing out and that's their signature here and for good reason it's just really bangin let's keep going I really want to mmm man so good so good this is actually my first hat review in literally over five years I actually reviewed their regular signature pastrami sandwich which you guys can take a look popping up on the playlist here right now along with the chili cheese fries so I'm so glad to add this one to it because naturally any sandwich that features the world famous pastrami here is something that you definitely want to check out why I waited so long to do that I don't know but I'm so glad that I did now also just so you guys know pastrami is pretty popular I'm sure you pretty much have it where you live as well and we have a bunch of spots here in LA most popular I think is Canters we have a place called Langer's but for a fast-casual for something quick to get the Hat is legendary for it so it's been around for so long 65 plus years and counting and I gotta say guys again this is just absolutely off the chart in terms of the flavor so if you guys are here on the west coast if you have a hat by you definitely you need to go give this one a shot their regular legendary pastrami is one thing having it on top of charbroiled beef goodness with everything else on top of that is another and I'm so glad to finally do it for you right now one more bite we'll give you one last close-up and then we'll wrap this one up after the rating but guys I think you know this is off the chart in terms of flavor the score is gonna be that as well hang on one second hmm I'm so glad this one is double wrapped right now because there's no way to do this without dropping stuff everywhere guys as you can see the meat is plentiful it's totally worth the money and like I said the flavor is off the chart so let's wrap this one up like I said and move on because you already know this thing is pretty insane alright so let me confirm the obvious for you with everything you've seen and heard up until right now how get the pastrami burger here at the hat get anything less than a 10 out of 10 there is really no way that this burger could have failed unless of course there was something wrong with the pastrami itself which there never is because the flavor is always the same super super delicious and like I said even though the beef on this one was a little on the dry side all of the moisture from that pastrami because it was so plentiful along with a Thousand Island and just the overall freshness of everything really rounded everything out completely so guys super delicious would I get this again over the pastrami maybe occasionally but on its own the pastrami is amazing I'm so glad to finally do this for you right now and like I said highly recommended beyond highly recommended it is mandatory if you guys are here on the west coast you need to give this one a shot okay now the obvious question is have you ever given this one a shot have you ever been to the Hat here on the west coast have you ever had the pastrami and actually have you ever had the pastrami burger I'm very curious to know that let me know what you thought of it if you did drop those comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K closing out another episode of peep this out bringing you brand new content
