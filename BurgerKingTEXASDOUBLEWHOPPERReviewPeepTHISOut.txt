 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty looks like good ol BK's got a new whopper variant here in the southwest that appears to be going for a little Texas Flair so let's go in in the all-new regional Texas double whopper and as expected a very beefy very tall situation here guys this is a pretty fantastic looking burger absolutely stacked with good stuff here starting off with the sesame seed bun let's take a look underneath you've got all the usual stuff from the standard whopper which means Mayo we've got lettuce we've got tomatoes we've got onions it's go a little further under here and as you guys can see the main draw with the Texas version we've got some sliced jalapenos and they replace the ketchup with mustard on this one along with some bacon we've got a slice of cheese we've got two quarter pound patties so we've got a half pound of beef on this thing here guys this is looking really nice see we can split it just a little bit for you just a slice of cheese on top a lots of beefy goodness and then on the very bottom of this one here it looks like it is gonna be just the bottom of the bun so it's all the standard double whopper ingredients - the ketchup but with some sliced jalapenos and bacon thrown into the mix and like I said it's absolutely packed as you guys can see so let's give this one a go and see how the flavor is gonna be it's the all-new regional Texas double whopper here at Burger King let's peep out this flavor man this burger is huge and that's one thing about the names of these burgers here at BK they do tend to advertise what they're promoting pretty well and considering this is a whopper in general you already know it's gonna be a big burger I mean guys look at it it is so before we get into this one and like always if

gonna have just a little bit of trouble getting to this review right now because I got a mouthful of jalapeno in that first bite along with the flame grilled beef which is really really tasty but that's spice that I'm getting is making my mouth explode with moisture so you're gonna get a lot of crazy jalapeno flavor with this one on top of the flame grilled beef already from BK but pretty nice so far guys let's go for another bite and we'll give you some more detail hang on mmm well it looks like now I'm getting a solid bite from the mustard to go with the spiciness of those jalapenos those are easily the two dominant flavors with this one on top of the flame grilled beef guys everything else is taking a backseat but man it is really really strong as I'm getting further into this I think the mustard was a nice choice to add that one-two punch to really deliver some extra flavor to this one heck even the Mayo on this is not really cooling it off and I can see why the Mayo would still be there because it's one of the main ingredients of the whopper in general but you'd think it's gonna add a little bit of coolness to the overall spice that I'm getting but guys with the mustard on top of the jalapenos that's really delivering some really really nice flavor and admittedly I gotta be honest like always with a name like the Texas double whopper I was hoping that was maybe just a little bit of barbecue sauce or something thrown into the mix maybe some crispy onions even when you think Texas you're probably thinking barbecue sauce those types of things but as it stands you're really getting like a very very spicy type of whopper with some mustard thrown in there as well instead of the ketchup it's a nice combination the name is a little odd to me but the flavor is pretty decent it's still BK it's still delicious let's go for one more bite and we'll close this one out mmm and let me just say that last bite was probably the best one of all because I actually got the crunch and snap and acidity of the pickle along with the spiciness of those jalapenos and the bite of the mustard as well with everything else in this one guys a very very nice combination it really is just a spicy whopper but I like it guys it's pretty tasty so yeah definitely a pretty tasty double whopper even though the name is still throwing me off just a little bit because naturally barbecue sauce is the first thing I'm thinking of when I think of Texas but let's be real if this was simply called the spicy double whopper I think that would have been probably the better way to go considering what it's got on it guys I mean the jalapenos deliver some heat in general they're really fresh this sliced pretty nicely when you combine that with the sharpness of that mustard and then the acidity and snap of those pickles it's a very potent trifecta that adds to that overall grilled beef flavor on that there pretty good so with that said I'm gonna have to give the Texas double whopper here at BK a pretty decent 7.5 out of 10 super fresh super spicy and definitely a very hearty sandwich worthy of the whopper name definitely give this one a shot if you have it in your area it is pretty tasty now the question is are you in a regional area where they're offering the Texas double whopper drop some comments down below let me know if you've actually been able to find this one
