 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty alright everyone let's get it it's Ian K back  again with another high quality foodie feature   for you here on peep this out reviews this time  over at panera bread to check out their debut of   their all new flatbread pizzas as part of their  fall menu for 2020 and with three tasty options   available i thought i'd go in on one variant that  would give me the best representation of the main   ingredients that are available in all three so  let's get into the margherita flatbread pizza and   i gotta say the presentation is very inviting when  you pop the top on this box guys this is looking   pretty fantastic what we've got here is a thin  crust flatbread made mostly of wheat flour that's   topped off with tomato bell pepper sauce sliced  fresh mozzarella a fontina and mozzarella blend   red grape tomatoes and then it's finished with  fresh basil and i gotta say guys it looks really   really great so let's not waste any more time on  this one let's get into this cheesy goodness it's   the margherita flatbread pizza here at panera bread  let's peep out this flavor yeah this looks pretty   fantastic i gotta admit the basil is jumping out  at me right now guys and the presentation alone   in the box looks pretty awesome lots of cheesy  goodness and the fresh mozzarella on this one is   really standing out as well pretty high quality  so let me pull up a quick piece of this real   fast here and give you a nice look again that is  pretty awesome those roma tomatoes in the very   top they're looking really nice and i gotta say  the cheese is nice as well a little toasty on the   bottom maybe a little bit more crisper i think  i would have preferred it but this is actually   looking really really great so guys before we  get into this and like always if you're a fan   of high quality delicious looking food reviews  make sure to hit that subscribe button down   below and don't forget to tap that bell icon so  you can be notified as soon as brand new content   drops every week here we go guys the margherita  flatbread pizza over here panera bread let's do it that's a light tomato base on this  one here but the cheese is good   yeah that cheese is very good it's very mild  actually in terms of the flavor and i got to   admit the saltiness is not quite there with  it but it does actually deliver some really   nice cheesy flavor even though it is on the  milder side the crust is very nice i wish it   was just a little bit more toastier that's the  only thing but that tomato bell pepper sauce is   actually delivering some additional flavor to it  there on top of the roma tomatoes on the very top   and of course the basil which is very vibrant  guys but still very very tasty let's keep going i'm digging that fresh mozzarella that's good  well i do have to say with a couple of bites   in this really is kind of satisfying  my itch for pizza but i wish it was   just a little bit thicker now granted  i know it's flat bread for what it is   but the crispiness is where you're going  to want it to really shine and so far   that's where it's kind of lacking just a little  bit as you can see in the bottom it's a little   bit light in terms of the crispness there i wish  it was just a little bit crunchier but overall   the flatbread is really really nice quality seems  like it's toastier more for the crust in the back   let's go for a quick bite there just to kind of  see if it can kind of rebound just a little bit definitely rebounded the ends are  crispier than the actual middle of it   but the fresh mozzarella the light fontina  mozzarella blend i'm kind of getting not really   but the tomatoes from the roma the roma goodness  is coming through mmm it's good it's pretty good   you know it's got kind of like an artisan brick  oven feel to it there the very bottom of it feels   like it's kind of dusted with flour slightly but  overall a very nice cafe style flatbread pizza   type of hybrid i want to call it actually because  it's not really pizza but for what it is it works   pretty well i mean you're getting kind of the  main ingredients a little bit of sauce some cheese   the basil is a nice touch and the overall  mozzarella like i said the fresh mozzarella   is what's selling this right now because the  quality is good it's a little on the milder side   but the creaminess is there and it works very  well with everything else let's keep going in that is really tasty might as well finish this alright let me pull up one more slice of this  here and while i'm doing that as you guys saw   in the very beginning you've got a couple  of other choices on the menu there's like   a chicken chipotle bacon i think variant as well  as like the standard cheese and you can actually   get like a little side entree to go with it for  i think four or five bucks i think added extra   to kind of make it a meal but i have to admit on  its own it really is pretty nice and it's got that   artsy type of feel to it there the roma tomatoes  really do take this one up a bit i got to admit   i kind of like tomatoes in this form only it works  well but the base with a tomato bell pepper base   it's very light as you can see barely anything  is there but it's mostly the fresh mozzarella   and that basil and again the combination of the  mozzarella and that fontina blend is a lovely   situation just overall a pretty tasty snack if  i would call it that if you're gonna eat this   whole thing obviously it's a meal and i'm probably  gonna do that but still pretty good for what it is so yeah not too much else to say about this one  and like i said at the top of the review i wanted   to go for the margherita variant because mostly all the ingredients on this one are in the others so   i really wanted to kind of taste the main base  to see what the quality was going to be like   and since it's panera bread it's a high quality  cafe style spot you've got a really nice thing to   look forward to with this in general naturally if  you go with the chicken the bacon that's going to   be pretty decent on top of all these ingredients  but guys on its own and with me being a cheese   lover this was an easy recommendation to start  off with i recommend going with this and kind   of working your way up to the other ones there  so let's just finish this one out with another   fast close-up of it here before the rating and as  you can see a nice lovely situation and again the   fresh mozzarella is amazing on this along with  the other combination of ingredients not bad   i just wish the very bottom was a little bit  toastier to kind of match the very ends of the   crust right there but what you're getting still  is pretty decent so with that said i'm gonna have   to give the margherita flatbread pizza part of  the all-new flatbread pizza line for fall 2020   here at panera bread a pretty rock-solid 7.7  out of 10 now guys don't let that score fool   you the quality of what you're getting is very  solid and you think the score would be higher   the only reason it's not is because the price  point is just a little up there i mean at almost   ten dollars for the size of the box it's really  not that big for ten dollars i gotta admit but   what you're getting like i said is quality made  i just wish it was just a little less expensive   that's really the main thing with this one here  but like i said the quality of what you're gonna   get is up there and i'd highly recommend it  if you've got panera bread in the area it is   worth giving a shot especially that one okay so  that's an obvious segue into the obvious question   are you gonna be giving this one a shot drop  some comments down below are you a fan of   panera bread in general if you've got them in the  area and if you are are you excited to give their   version of flatbread pizza a shot drop those  comments down below and definitely let me

while you stay   tuned for that next review coming real soon in  the meantime stay frosty definitely some pretty   tasty stuff guys but you know what if this was  actually like say $7.99 it'd be even
