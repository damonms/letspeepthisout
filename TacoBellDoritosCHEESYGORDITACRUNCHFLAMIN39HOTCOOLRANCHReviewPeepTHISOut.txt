 what's going on everyone welcome or  welcome back to the channel it's Ian K   where today i'm over at taco bell because it  looks like a fan favorite menu item is getting   the flamin hot cool ranch treatment for a limited  time only that's right and you already know what   it is so stay tuned because the doritos cheesy  gordita crunch flamin hot cool ranch is up next   welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty well it's a mouthful of a title but then again  this looks like a mouthful period guys feast your   eyes on the doritos cheesy gordita crunch flamin  hot cool ranch a very lovely situation of hefty   taco bell goodness in my hand here right now and  i gotta say i am totally digging the presentation   with this one there's lots of goodness on the  inside and you know we gotta break this one   down first let's get into it so working our way  outside in what we've got is that famous gordita   shell nice and puffy and dusted with a little bit  of flour and on the inside it looks like a three   cheese blend and that's actually what's separating  the flaming hot cool ranch corn taco shell   i gotta say guys definitely a lovely situation  already it's looking pretty nice and of course   it's dusted with the good stuff to add even  more flavor to what we're about to get into   on the inside of this one which consists of  seasoned beef spicy ranch shredded lettuce   and on the top of that shredded cheddar cheese  so a very nice combination of taco bell flavors   and of course with the flamin hot goodness to  go with with a little bit of cool ranch to try   and cool it down just a bit but even still guys a  very nice presentation on this one and i gotta say   it looks very hefty and it feels pretty hefty  i can't wait to get into this but on the real   if ever there was a taco bell item that would  benefit from having one of those sleeves that   these are supposed to have i think this one would  be definitely it guys because there is a lot of   stuff about to fall out the back of this one as  you can see plenty of that spicy ranch goodness   but still very hefty it looks very satisfying  it smells pretty satisfying let's not waste any   more time it's the cheesy gordita crunch flamin  hot cool ranch a mouthful of a title let's do it right off the break that spicy ranch is doing  it to me guys it hurts so good along with that   seasoned beef and then you get the nice crunch  of the shell on the inside and of course the   softness that i'm getting from the gordita  shell itself but guys a lovely combination   of the good stuff over here at taco bell with  a little bit of flaming hot action thrown   in for good measure it's not really so much  hot as it is kind of cool believe it or not   because of the spicy ranch having a little  bit of heat it's still a little cool anyway   and i guess you kind of expect that because  aside from the light tang that i'm getting from   the ranch itself there it's a little bit elevated  but then it kind of levels out just a little bit   but still with the flaming hot goodness on the  inside and all the cheesy goodness that i'm   kind of getting from the very top of this so  far it's a flavorful bite let's keep going in you know i'm not really tasting too much of the  flamin hot goodness with this one i mean visually   the shell looks really awesome and the color looks  pretty amazing on this but when you combine that   with the spicy ranch which is actually a lot  stronger along with the seasoned beef i gotta   say that combination is a beautiful thing and  then naturally with all the cheesy goodness on   the very top of this a very lovely situation the  nice doughiness that i'm getting from that gordita   shell is definitely on point and i'm definitely  loving the fact of that soft crunch that it's   got there very nice combination and the textures  are pretty nice on this yeah i had a feeling i was   gonna like this one guys i mean how could you  not with all the familiar flavors of taco bell   on the inside of something very very tasty yet  crunchy and soft at the same time considering i   actually checked out the regular version of the  doritos cheesy gordita crunch not that long ago   that was a pretty nice combination of cheesy  goodness there but with this one having flaming   hot the spicy ranch is kind of elevating just the  overall heat on its own as opposed to what should   be coming from the shell it could just be playing  with my head at the same time but what i've got   here still is super flavorful let's go for one  more bite we're gonna get into some diablo sauce   guys because we definitely gotta do that hang  on mmm love that bottom portion nice and meaty   yeah definitely some good stuff the spicy  ranch is second only to the avocado variant   over here which i really dig this is  just really really delicious right now   okay let's get into some diablo  sauce guys take a look at this   tattoos or it didn't happen we're going to  give this one a shot let's give this a go get this one cracked in over here got to  be careful i wish i had a little bit of a   shell or something to kind of hold this hopefully  that's staying in focus for you guys there we go   got it all lathered up with  a diablo goodness let's do it that is the ticket right there a little bit more  elevated heat now it's flaming hot that's pretty   nice all right so i see you taco bell you've got  the official marketing going with the doritos   goodness with this one and actually with flaming  hot being a major addition to this on top of it   it's really more of the color for me at  least because naturally having a red shell   really stands out but guys even still a lovely  combination of the taco bell goodness all around   with this just a lovely combination overall and i  gotta say again if you love taco bell and i have   a feeling you do if you made it this runs to the  review you know exactly what to expect from this   one with or without some extra hot sauce this is  definitely a banging situation so let's go for one   more bite we'll wrap the review up with the rating  coming up next but guys again another fun outing   over here at taco bell with a very colorful  and tasty item to go in on too let's do it well i gotta say the color of the shell  is really playing with my head right now   because like i said all the heat is primarily  coming from the spicy ranch with this one and   naturally with the diablo sauce i just put on  that's a very lovely situation but guys all the   classic flavors of taco bell on display for you as  usual but with a very nice color differentiation   between the ingredients here and i gotta say it  presents very nicely on top of the softness of   the gordita shell and the crunch of the taco  shell as well the brand name everything to go   with it's a very nice package and the price isn't  too bad on this one either order ahead and pick   yours up at our contactless drive-thru yeah i do  love me some taco bell i gotta admit every once   in a while what they do on the regular they do  very very well and i definitely enjoy checking   out their stuff in addition to the promo stuff  naturally here on the channel but guys again   very nice combination of goodness on that one and  like i said the presentation is pretty banging   all right so with that said i'm gonna have to  give the doritos cheesy gordita crunch flamin   hot cool ranch a crazy mouthful of a title a rock  solid 9 out of 10 like i said guys the execution   on this one was absolutely beautiful the only  downside with it is that the actual flaming hot   flavor that he was supposed to have in this one is  not really prevalent there so for me it's really   more of the visual the red shell naturally for  what it's got but everything else that it's got   on the inside of that one it was really really  nice i mean that spicy ranch lit it up big time   and while the cool ranch wasn't really pronounced  either all the combination of the flavors together   gave you a very hearty bite and a very satisfying  one for a little over four bucks it's not bad   whatsoever all right so do me a quick favor for  those of you who've already given this one a try   drop some comments down below let me know how your  experience was with it i mean were you able to   actually taste the flaming hot along with the cool  ranch like i said with everything that that one's   got on the inside i really wasn't getting too much  of that but the spicy ranch is beautiful across   the board so it meshes beautifully with everything  but did you actually taste the flaming hot and   cool ranch drop those comments down below and  definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K   closing out another high quality foodie feature  for you here on peep this out reviews bringing   you brand new content every single week here on  my channel so while you stay tuned for that next review   coming real soon in the meantime stay frosty all  right taco bell so what i'm thinking about you not   having a taco tray or something to kind of hold  this in like a sleeve is because you're probably   thinking the gordita shell itself is going to do  the job to kind of hold all the crunchies together   but what about the back you've got a lot of stuff  falling out the back here and it's super messy   this definitely needs a taco sleeve just like  the regular doritos locos taco come on all   right everyone until next time i'll talk to you  soon hey thanks for checking out another one of   my reviews but just in case you didn't see the one  before this one you can find it right up over here   along what i think youtube's gonna recommend  for you to check out as well as always i think   you'll find something like in both of them and  i'll definitely catch you in the next one see ya
