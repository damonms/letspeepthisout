barbeque dogs selections so stay tuned because the Carolina dog is up next welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty so here we go with the latest from the world's most wanted wiener the Carolina dog fresh off their all-new United States a barbecue dogs menu and just in time for fourth of July as well and that's absolutely a good thing guys feast your eyes on this one it's looking pretty tasty what we've got here is plenty of grilled onions we've got a pickle spear and we've got a full strip of bacon on the side they're all on top of an all beef hot dog smothered in Carolina gold barbecue sauce along with cheese so let me see if I can kind of lift this around here because it is definitely covered there is the cheese on the very bottom right there and plenty of barbecue sauce as well looks kind of drenched right there but guys a pretty solid build on this one this one absolutely had me at a full pickle spear so that's one of the reasons I wanted to get this one to try it look the most interesting out of the group and guys those onions are lighting up my car beautifully right now let's not waste any more time on this one let's see if the flavors gonna deliver it's the all-new Carolina dog here a Wienerschnitzel let's peep out this flavor all right right off the break let me get this one started by saying that yes it was the pickle slice that pretty much convinced me to give this one a shot because I love pickles I love hot dogs and together it's a lovely combination but honestly barbecue sauce is the other wildcard with this one and clearly with the promo having barbecue sauce across the board how can I not give this one a shot so a combination of the two along with what I like which is the pickle situation of course the grilled onions and guys that strip of bacon on the inside you know that's gonna be a lovely situation so before hopefully confirm the goodness on this one for you and like always if you guys are fans of high-quality delicious looking food of use make sure to hit that subscribe button down below don't forget to tap that Bell icon so you could be notified as soon as brand-new content drops every week guys the Carolina dog part of the United States at barbecue dogs here at Wienerschnitzel let's do it first off the Carolina Gold barbecue sauce very sweet a little bit of spice to it nothing crazy but very very lovely with the pickle spear the nice brine the nice saltiness that I'm getting from that on top of it that snap is a beautiful thing and then the bacon and then believe it or not the dog that's a lovely combination guys and again I'm really diggin that actually I was really hoping that the pickle spear was gonna kind of drown out a little bit of everything else on this because of how strong pickle slices tend to be and this actually is a full-on deli style pickle but guys with that all beef hot dog and then at Carolina gold barbecue sauce really delivering the goods it's actually really good a little sweet but really really tasty so let's keep going with this one but so far so good I'm diggin it uh-huh yeah I'm really digging this I am not missing any mustard on this whatsoever that Carolina gold barbecue sauce is adding a nice bit of sweetness and overall flavor it's got a little bit of a punch to it which is really awesome but I got to admit again the pickle slice again is delivering across the board for me there it's really solid it's got just the right amount of saltiness overall and just the quality in general is good as expected and because of the quality of the barbecue sauce I'm not tasting the cheese whatsoever on this one and honestly I don't really mind it because it's really kind of the placeholder like it usually is for most sandwiches to kind of keep things together so with all the barbecue sauce on this and there's plenty of it naturally you don't want things slipping and sliding the cheese is going the extra mile to really help with that and again the quality of the dog is pretty good not an overly huge hot dog but at the same time the quality with everything else on it is awesome the actual crunch of those grilled onions everything along with that that's just a beautiful situation and this kind of reminds me of the Chicago dog that I actually reviewed a couple of years back which you guys can see popping up on your screen here right now that was a pretty tasty hot dog as well and honestly one of the last times I have had Wienerschnitzel up until this right now so the evolutionary step up from the Chicago dog is a little bit of a different ingredients list on that one but the grilled onions make this one the nice hickory smokedness that I'm getting from the bacon and of course that Carolina Gold barbecue sauce beautiful situation guys it really is so with this one on the menu aside from the Kansas City dog and the texas dog both of those actually i believe offers sweet baby Ray's barbecue sauce this is a great deal to have Carolina barbecue sauce on a Carolina dog and actually it's the mode for what it is but guys very delicious on this one and again everything is working with it minus the cheese of course and again that's the placeholder so one more bite we'll finish this one up after the rating but guys very tasty very tasty indeed so you've got some elevated sweetness from that Carolina Gold barbecue sauce and that's actually not a bad thing on this one because it really complements the saltiness that I'm getting from the hotdog itself along from the pickle spear on this one let's not forget about that bacon strip that you're seeing there as well along with the grilled onions on the very top there guys but overall a fairly decent sized dog it's not overly huge and the price point is about average on it but everything else does deliver and the quality is pretty tasty a worthy addition to the United States of barbeque dogs over here at Wienerschnitzel I don't know maybe it's just me but I think they probably should have gone the footlong route with these hot dogs considering how tasty that one was I actually wish I had more of it considering the price point and naturally with the price point being just average I was expecting just a little bit more overall on the size department but the flavor did deliver overall so with that said I'm gonna have to give the Carolina dog part of the United States of barbeque dogs I'll be here at Wienerschnitzel a pretty solid 7.9 out of 10 guys very very close to the 8, 8 1/2 category if only the cheese actually activated something flavor-wise that would have been beautiful to go with it but the strong pungent flavors of the barbecue sauce the bacon and the pickle spear pretty much drowned it out but again like I always say cheese is typically the placeholder for all the condiments on there but naturally I would have liked to have tasted a little bit of the cheese considering it's part of what's on it right you really want to taste it overall all right now speaking of overall what's your overall thought of this particular one drop some comments down below let me know if you're gonna be swinging over to Wienerschnitzel either at night like I did actually right now or during the day to give one of these United States of barbeque dogs a shot is the Carolina dog on your hit list drop those comments down
