 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty bk says move over to French toast as it introduces a new line of breakfast sandwiches that look perfectly suited for the fall season that's right maple sure feels like fall to me and these all new maple waffle sandwiches here at BK look like they're gonna fit that bill pretty nicely I'm really diggin the presentation of this maple waffle bread lookin nice and crispy nice and toasty if you look closely on top it looks like it's infused with maple flavoring little darker spots that you can see spread out there let's take a look underneath and see what we're working with here looks like we have got a slice of American cheese two slices of hickory smoked bacon maybe just one slice split in half but looking pretty good fluffy egg folded over I do believe bk has some of the best fast food eggs out there and that's pretty much it it's just really those main ingredients guys looking really really tasty and although this has got that maple flavoring infused of course I did get a little extra syrup here to have a little fun with this one as we get into the review let's see if this one's gonna deliver on the flavor it's the all new maple waffle sandwich with bacon here at BK let's peep out this flavor mmm is love in the air right now because the maple aroma absolutely is and I definitely love it guys it smells really really good I'm really diggin the fact that the crispiness on this is really standing out guys as I'm holding this it doesn't really feel fried it doesn't really feel toasted it's like in the middle and it's got a little bit of like a flower dusting feeling to it my hands kind of feel like you're a little bit more dusted so before I take the first bite and as always if you guys are fans of high

go with the maple waffle sandwich here at BK with that bacon action let's do it mmm it's almost got a biscuit vibe to it hmm and it's getting very thick as I'm chewing into this guy's looks are a little deceiving on this one it's got the denseness feeling of like a biscuit but a nice sweet mapley flavor coming up on the back end it really wow it really feels pretty dense I wish I had something to drink with me right now but as usual very nice flavor from the egg the folded egg is pretty good the bacon kind of the basic stuff you get here at BK for the breakfast sandwiches here it's all the same things you know with the new maple waffle bread that surprisingly feels like it's thicker and thicker as you're getting into it at least after that first let's keep going hmm wow don't let the looks of this one fool you guys that is really really dense when it comes to that maple waffle bread it almost feels like it expands as you're chewing it after that first bite I was like wow this is really pretty thick but as you can see the basic ingredients that we already talked about right there and although it does seem a little on the thin side it really packs a very nice amount of flavor just the right amount of sweetness and I'm really diggin that maple overall flavor to match the aroma in the car pretty good and speaking of that maple flavor it kind of helps that you can actually see it which is kind of a nice thing most of these types of sandwiches say they just have maple flavoring and you really can't tell anything other than the toastiness that it's got on the outside but the fact that you can see little specks of maple flavoring in there really goes a long way and actually guys let me try this by itself actually I'm pulling a piece just with the maple flavoring right there at the very edge yeah a decent amount of sweetness this is actually really really tasty but with all that said let's go for a little overload and go for some standard syrup to see what that's gonna do to this cuz this is already packing some pretty decent flavor nice and thick I think this little platform right here will do nicely indeed let's go for it adds a little bit of that syrup went over the edge but that's okay because we've got plenty of syrup on this one here we go mmm extra ya gotta love it and it's just so dense a lot of extra flavor with that one guys a little bit of the extra maple goodness on top of the thickness of that waffle man these are really really tasty whoever is making these for bk definitely they need to keep this on the menu it's good and of course naturally with the sneak-attack denseness of that maple waffle bread along with the syrup itself I can't taste the cheese one bit on this guy's again I think that's just kind of keeping everything together as always but there's no real flavor really standing out from it but hey I guess just bacon and egg wouldn't really look good for advertising purposes so I see why they always use cheese I just wish it would just stand out just a little bit in these sandwiches but guys the highlight is obviously gonna be the maple waffle bread that's the main reason you want to go for this one decent well let me just say it takes a lot for me to get up really early in the morning to go for breakfast I mean my favorite time of the night to actually have it is just that at night after midnight preferably it's really the funnest time for me to have it but I gotta be honest if I was up early and I was itching for say waffles or pancakes and I didn't want to make it myself I would probably rock that guy's because the quality was pretty decent and like said very deceiving on the overall flavor with that one there I mean it did deliver the maple goodness but it had so much more denseness and additional flavor because of that once I've been into it and started chewing it up it felt like it was like expanding like I really had to keep chewing this one as though it was like a thicker biscuit but it was very very tasty overall and I would easily rock that one again so with that said I'm gonna have to give the maple waffle sandwich with bacon here at BK are pretty rock solid 8.8 out of 10 guys it's really close to the 9 almost 10 range because the quality delivered on this one and like I said don't let the size deceive you it's packing some surprising denseness with the right amount of sweetness and of course all the familiar flavors from breakfast here at BK with the egg in the bacon I just wish the cheese stood out just a little bit more but hey it is what it is okay do me a quick favor drop some comments down below and let me know if you're a breakfast person in particular and if you are are you gonna give one of these maple waffle sandwiches a shot drop those comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K closing out another episode of peep this out bringing you brand new content every single week here on my channel so while you
