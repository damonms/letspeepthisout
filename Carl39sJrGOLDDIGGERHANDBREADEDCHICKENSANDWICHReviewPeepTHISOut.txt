 hey everyone and welcome or welcome back to  the channel it's Ian K where today i'm over at   carl's jr to check out their latest promo which  looks pretty interesting at least by the name   of it anyway so stay tuned because the gold  digger hand breaded chicken sandwich is up next   welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty all right now i'm not saying she's a gold  digger carl's jr is guys feast your eyes   on what they're calling the gold digger hand  breaded chicken sandwich and as you can see here   the greenery is on display for you big time  on the bottom that's looking pretty awesome   as well as a fairly decent size on that chicken  filet as well let's break this one down real quick   all right so it's flavor lit by fryer this time  out and as we go in on what looks to be a very   tasty looking chicken sandwich let's pop the top  of this potato bun and take a look underneath and   what you're going to see initially is some  of that carolina gold barbecue sauce action   some of the sweetness definitely and you  can really smell it pretty well in the car   next up we've got a couple of pieces of fairly  crispy looking bacon loaded up with that barbecue   sauce as well and it's all sitting on top of a  hand breaded crispy white meat chicken filet and   as you can see that is definitely one of the main  stars of the show not bad in the size department   and it's looking nice and crispy underneath it and  to round this one out we have the usual tomato and   a fairly decent piece of lettuce guys that leaf  lettuce is looking pretty awesome and underneath   it a very generous helping of mayo as well it  looks like it's all across the bottom but guys   again coming back to the smell of my car right now  it smells like hand breaded goodness for sure along   with that carolina gold barbecue sauce i think  i'm in for a pretty tasty situation with this one   so there you go it's the all-new gold digger  hand breaded chicken sandwich here at carl's   jr let's peep out this flavor yeah i can't get  the kanye west song out of my head right now   and admit it you probably thought the same  thing when you heard the name of this right   i mean gold digger what is up with that i guess  obviously with the carolina gold barbecue sauce   that's probably where they're going with it  but gold digger drop some comments down below   if there's something that i'm missing here with  this but even still it looks like a pretty tasty   chicken sandwich either way all right so here  we go finally guys let's get a few bites in on   this one it's the all new gold digger hand breaded  chicken sandwich here at carl's jr let's do it chicken is juicy yeah definitely juicy after that first bite i  pretty much didn't get anything except the chicken   itself and some of the bun but as you're going to  see here it is a very nice piece of chicken guys   breaded up beautifully and that flavor is awesome  let's go for another few on this because naturally   i got to get everything in one bite again here  we go with some of that bacon action let's do it mmm okay well i'm getting a little bit of a honey  mustard vibe guys but still the quality is off   the chart the sweetness from that barbecue sauce  goes amazing with the hickory smoke of the bacon   and as you can see with that chicken right there  beautiful cross-section shot this is really really   delicious right now guys i'd want to say maybe  about 80% meat 20% coating and it looks   beautiful i got to say again the quality of that  carolina gold barbecue sauce is really lighting   this one up very nicely with that bacon very  lovely so far you know i guess a little goes   a long way because the amount of barbecue sauce  that i have on this that carolina gold goodness is   actually coating the top of the bun pretty nicely  and it's very vibrant very rich but i gotta say it   goes amazing again with that bacon guys that combo  is beautiful no cheese needed with this whatsoever   you really don't need it because the flavor of  the barbecue sauce and the bacon is lighting   this one up so let's go for a few more bites in  this guys very tasty chicken sandwich here at carls love that juiciness yeah this carolina gold  barbecue sauce is really lighting this one   up guys and considering i've done just about  every other chicken sandwich they have over   here at carl's jr especially since they've  switched over to the hand breaded goodness   take a look at the playlist popping up on your  screen here right now this is easily one of the   top tiers because it's definitely different i  mean barbecue sauce along with crispy chicken   of course it's going to be beautiful right  with some bacon thrown into the mix but when   you add that barbecue sauce to it especially this  variant with the light sweetness and the smokiness   with a little bit of a honey mustard vibe  that i'm getting it goes amazing because i'm   down with honey mustard guys very very beautiful  let's go for another couple on this one hang on you know i can't believe i'm taking this one down  with that tomato slice because that's normally my   kryptonite along with cilantro but it goes so  beautifully with everything here in the flavor   department i'm not really minding that tomato at  all because of how vibrant everything else is and   of course it is set up beautifully with that juicy  chicken guys just a lovely situation all around   with that barbecue sauce on that bacon loveliness  loveliness loviness and now about halfway in i'm   beginning to kind of taste the mayo which is not  necessarily my favorite either but i have to say   guys the vibrancy of that carolina gold barbecue  sauce is masking everything along with the bacon   flavor with this so that really is the wild card  that's the main thing they're pushing with this   one but again where does gold digger come into  the mix again kanye maybe if you're watching   this right now drop some comments down below  let me know what you think but guys even still   i'm digging the breading on this the quality of  the chicken is good price point's a little up   there it's carl's jr naturally especially here  on the west coast but hey what are you gonna do   flavor's still pretty banging all right so let's  go for one more bite on this one before we wrap   the review up with the rating coming up next but  guys i gotta say as good as this carolina gold   barbecue sauce is in the chicken i really can't  wait to try it on that double cheeseburger they've   got over here so watch for that one coming soon  one more bite we'll close this one out hang on well i appreciate the chicken sandwich diaper on  the back of this one i guess it's more for the   mayo than anything else but guys even still it's  holding everything together and as you can see it   really kind of needs it because this one's kind of  slipping and sliding slightly but at the same time   what you're going to get here is a very flavorful  chicken sandwich even if it's a little on the   expensive side but the quality across the board  is beautiful and again that carolina gold barbecue   sauce along with the bacon very lethal combination  of flavor with this one very very tasty   so with that said i'm going to have to give this  all-new gold digger hambridge chicken sandwich   here at carl's jr a pretty solid 8.8 out of 10  guys the only thing really killing this one is   the price point like i said for about $8.59 here in  southern cali that is definitely top tier in terms   of pricing when it comes to chicken sandwiches  and while it's nowhere near as competitive as   the other guys because of price point the  quality of that one really speaks for itself   again the carolina goodness that you're going to  get with that gold barbecue sauce and the bacon   is very primo but it's the breading and the meat  especially that really pushes that one i just   wish it was just a little bit cheaper but even  still very tasty nonetheless all right so do me   a favor drop some comments down below what did  you think of this chicken sandwich over here at   carl's jr out of all the ones that they've had up  to this point especially if you're in the area and   you've tried some of them how do you think this  one compares at least visually to you drop those   comments down below and definitely let me know  and with that this is Ian K closing out another   high quality foodie feature for you here on peep  this out reviews bringing you brand new content   every single week here on my channel so while you  stay tuned for the next review coming real soon   in the meantime stay frosty yes sir tender and  juicy indeed this sure was for me today guys i   have to say the quality of this one was off the  chart in the preparation department aside from the   flavor as well guys it just visually looked pretty  awesome but even still a little on the pricey   side carl's jr you gotta do something about that  alright guys until next time i'll talk to you soon   hey thanks for checking out another  one of my reviews but just in case you   didn't
