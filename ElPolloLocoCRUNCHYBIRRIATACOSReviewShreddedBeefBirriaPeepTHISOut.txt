 hey everyone and welcome or welcome back to the  channel it's Ian K where today i'm over at el   pollo loco because they finally got shredded  beef birria on the menu for the first time ever   so sit tight because i'm going to be checking  it out with a couple of their crunchy tacos   welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty yes sir i think i'm in for a crunchy good time  with this one guys feast your eyes on their   all-new birria crunchy tacos here at el pollo  loco and clearly a very crispy crunchy situation   you've got all on your screen here right now this  is looking pretty awesome and especially with   what's on the inside of this one i think this is  going to be pretty tasty let's break this one down   real quick all right so on the inside of this  el pollo loco birria box what we've got here   are two crunchy tacos filled with tender shredded  beef birria along with cheese chopped onions and   normally cilantro but clearly i left that out and  if you're wondering what exactly birria is it's a   traditional soup or stew made with a combination  normally of chili pepper based goat meat adobo   garlic cumin bay leaves and thyme and that's all  cooked on low heat to simmer all that goodness on   the inside of what's clearly beef in this case  guys i don't think we actually have goat meat   adobo but even still the presentation is looking  pretty nice and naturally the other star of the   show is the consome basically a richly flavored  stock or broth that we're going to be dipping into   guys so when you combine everything together here  this should be a very flavorful situation for sure   so there you go it's the birria crunchy tacos  here at el pollo loco let's peep out this flavor   yes there is some lovely crispy action with  everything on the inside of this one and while   they do feel a little on the oily side in my hands  right now there's like a lot of oil actually on my   fingertips i'm really excited to go in on this  because i have never dipped into this goodness   before hopefully that's holding the focus as much  as possible for you let's give this a shot we're   going to go for the dunk we're going to go for the  eat and we're going to repeat it naturally let's   give this a shot my first time trying birria  and it's over here at el pollo loco let's do it hmm ultra flavorful ooo that's really good while  the consome itself is a bit on the brisket   tasting side to me guys this is actually very  vibrant and actually when you go for that dipping   action on the inside of this one here even though  it has a little bit of the light cilantro in here   this is pretty nice already very flavorful  on that shredded beef let's keep going in wow a little on the oily side   and some of that's coming from the cheese  too but man super flavorful super rich   the distribution of the shredded beef birria  on the inside of these tacos is a little on the   uneven side but the flavor is absolutely there  along with that cheese blend and a nice little   crunch i'm getting from the outside shell as well  as the onions guys not a bad presentation and the   flavor is awesome and of course when you add  in that consome right over here to dip into   a very lovely situation let's go for another  couple on this this is very nicely done i wish   i had just a little bit more of the sauce to coat  it more there we go let me give this a little bit   of a wash back and forth here but very nice  flavor so far very nice let's keep going in crispy crunchy nice flavor wow it makes it with the beef as  you'd expect that's really nice   yeah the flavor is very rich on this sauce  guys this really is a highlight i think it'd   be kind of nice to go in with some of the other  items they have on the menu as you're probably   seeing up on the screen here right now they've  got their quesadilla as well as a burrito you   can go into so adding even more denseness to it  but guys what i'm getting is some smoky flavor   with this i don't know why that's standing out  to me mostly here but it goes beautifully with   the fried outer coating of the shell and then  naturally with that beef on the inside it's a   little uneven there as it tries to stay focused in  but the cheese blend is beautiful and the oiliness   is absolutely there on these but still very  very tasty let's go for another couple on this   one but i am totally digging this it's a very  nice combination and as a fast food first from   places to do this naturally there from el pollo loco  especially this is pretty cool couple more bites yeah that saltiness is not bad either but man  the smokiness i'm getting it's really good   so yeah i'm digging this my first experience  trying birria in this form at least from a   fast food spot which is kind of cool but i have to  say the flavor and the aroma is really selling me   on this particular one and of course it pairs up  very nicely just with the crunchy tacos aside from   the oiliness of them i have to say it is a nice  combination of crispy goodness to go along with   that shredded birria beef but even still like  i said very very nice for my first experience   giving this a shot all right so let's go for  one more bite to knock off this little piece   right now and then we'll finish the review up  with the rating coming up next but guys again a   very fun experience giving this one a shot and  just to get this one outfitted for battle here   let's go for a little bit right there there  we go very very nice indeed and again bringing   out that flavor pretty awesome one more  bite and then we'll close it out hang on its good well out of all the three options available  to give this consome dipping action a shot when   it comes to the birria here at el pollo loco  i think i chose the option that was going to   give me the most oil considering these are fried  shells but what's on the inside is definitely what   counts and along with the cheese and the onions  and normally the cilantro what you've got is a   very lovely situation to dip into right here guys  and again the combination is a beautiful one very   nice indeed and absolutely worth checking out if  you've got el pollo loco in the area pretty tasty   feed your sense of street food adventure with  new shredded beef birria from el pollo loco feed   the flame all right so with that said i'm going  to have to give these birria crunchy tacos here   at el pollo loco a pretty decent 8.1 out of 10 and  i'm not going to go much higher than that because   like i said this was a bit of an oily situation  today for me but even still the flavor of that   consome dipping action was beautiful guys  that really is one of the main highlights on top   of the beef on the inside of these tacos as well  naturally if you like cilantro you have that much   more to look forward to with this one but a very  decent amount of cheese otherwise along with those   chopped onions definitely something to check out  and of course nice and crunchy all right so do me   a quick favor drop some comments down below let me  know if you're going to be giving this one a shot   over here at el pollo loco and if you've actually  had this more traditionally in the past how do   you think it compares overall to that drop some  comments down below and definitely let me know and   with that this is Ian K closing out another high  quality foodie feature for you here on peep this   out reviews bringing you brand new content every  single week here on my channel so
