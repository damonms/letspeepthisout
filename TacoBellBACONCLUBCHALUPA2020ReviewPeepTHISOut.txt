 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty hey everyone welcome back to another high quality  foodie feature for you here on the channel where   this time i'm headed into taco bell to check out  a returning favorite that i've actually never tried   either on or off camera let's get right into it  guys feast your eyes on the bacon club chalupa   and as usual we've got a nice toasty flaky  situation with that outer flatbread style   chalupa shell looking pretty nice guys and  that delivery system to get everything on the   inside of this one into my face is looking  really really nice i'm really digging the   color of it here take a look on the inside  what we've got is a combination of chicken   a three cheese blend bacon lettuce tomato and  avocado ranch sauce so technically it's kind of   like a blt sandwich guys with chicken but it looks  pretty tasty i gotta admit i am really digging the   amount of goodness on the inside of this one and  the smokiness of that bacon is really lighting   up my car right now so let's get into this one  guys it's the bacon club chalupa my first time   giving this a go here at taco bell let's peep  out this flavor yesir the nice toasty flaky   almost butteriness of this chalupa shell is a  lovely situation guys it really is the hallmark   over here at taco bell they're very very popular  and for obvious reasons as you can see a nice   thickness of it as well and all the goodness with  this flavor this time out here with the blt style   bacon club is looking pretty nice here guys i have  to admit i'm really digging that now keep in mind   tomato is not really my favorite although  i'm getting a little bit better with it   so i'm just going to give this one a shot for  you guys but it really looks pretty fantastic   all right enough talking here we go it's the  bacon club chalupa here at taco bell let's do it wow well first off you can't fade the avocado  ranch sauce here at taco bell it's definitely   a favorite and it goes amazingly well with the  light butteriness of the chalupa shell itself   the thickness of the chicken on top of it guys a  lovely situation let me just show you this here   real quick I'll try and keep it as focused as i can  considering it's kind of raining at the moment   but as you can see nice and chunky on the  chicken the smokiness of that bacon is amazing   the light three cheese blend that  i'm tasting with this one is just   kind of light just like i said there but  it's the avocado ranch lighting this one   up let's keep going in i am definitely  digging this right now it's pretty tasty   oh yeah well as you guys can see there is a nice  amount of bacon on the inside of this one here   and it looks like it's the type of bacon they use  with their breakfast menu so naturally it's kind   of chopped up and minced there but a really really  nice combination very smoky and the thickness of   the chicken is on point the lettuce of course  adding a little bit of extra crunch there and   of course the tomatoes and the light cheese blend  that this has got here as well a nice combination   but again this is a total showcase for the  avocado ranch in the chalupa shell nice and let   me just say i'm so glad i've got some protection  underneath my camera here right now because i'm   dropping tomatoes all over the place but it's all  good guys because it's par for the course there's   a lot of them on here right now but aside from  that i gotta say i'm kind of digging them on this   this is actually not bad and considering all the  variations of the chalupa that i reviewed over the   years take a look at the playlist popping up on  your screen here right now this is actually pretty   tasty but the big thing for me and i'm saying  it all throughout the review is the avocado   ranch sauce and the bacon is amazing on this  the thickness of the chicken on top of it   a very lovely situation let's go for a couple  more bites real quick this is really good guys   oh yeah and on the real it feels like taco  bell's version of a blt sandwich but with   chicken so naturally everything else on the  inside of this of course with that standard   taco style chalupa shell really goes pretty  nicely here but again very popular for what   these chalupas are and i can easily see why  they're favorites doesn't really matter what   you put on the inside of them the flaky  nice chewiness that they have as well   is a beautiful situation but you know what i'm  really surprised that i'm liking this one as much   as i am considering the amount of tomatoes on this  right now so that's a plus right there because the   quality is pretty good and the fact that this is  freshly made right now is probably adding to that   but even still guys a very delicious chalupa all  right so let's go for one more bite of this one   and let me just say i am so glad to add this one  to the collection of reviews here on my channel   for taco bell a very nice addition and again the  smokiness of the bacon with the avocado ranch the   combination is primo and it works extremely well  with this one more bite we'll finish this one out   so let's go for a little 360 on this one and as  you can see that is a beautiful shot of all the   goodness on the inside this is pretty packed guys  and i have to say it's pretty evenly distributed   with all the ingredients here the nice toastiness  of that chalupa shell is accenting all of it and   as you can see just a lovely combination if you  guys are fans of chalupas already you already   know what to expect but if you're a fan of blt  style chalupas let's just say you're in for a nice   treat because this returning favorite is going to  satisfy a lot of peeps who love it very very tasty   so with that said i'm going to have to give the  returning bacon club chalupa my first time giving   it a go here at taco bell a rock solid 9 out of  10 guys this one easily satisfied right now and   honestly with the addition of the chunky chicken  with this on top of it with the avocado ranch with   the smokiness of the bacon it's a beautiful  combination but again it's that chalupa shell   that's really selling this along with that sauce  it is really really tasty together and again the   quality very solid guys i mean i did get this one  freshly made right now and i gotta say it makes   a world of difference delicious stuff okay so for  all you peeps out there who may have had this one   in the past how excited are you that taco bell is  bringing this one back to close out 2020 are you   super glad this is on the
