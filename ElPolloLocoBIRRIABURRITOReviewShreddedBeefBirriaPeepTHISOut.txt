 what's going on everyone and welcome or  welcome back to the channel it's Ian K   where today i'm over at el pollo loco  to finish out my trifecta of reviews on   their all-new shredder beef birria so stay  tuned because the burrito variant's up next   welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty well here we go with round three over here at  el pollo loco guys and i think i may have saved   the best for last with this new shredded beef  birria action because this is looking pretty   awesome feast your eyes on the burrito variant and as  this begins to focus in you're going to see we've   got a lot of hefty goodness right here in my hand  i'm really digging the presentation of this one   already as well as the toastiness of that tortilla  in my hand as well let's break this one down real   quick all right so what i've got for you today is  that burrito split in half along with the side of   that consome dipping sauce and i gotta say guys  the presentation is looking pretty good across the   board here starting off with the burrito what  we've got here is an oversized flour tortilla   filled with shredded beef birria and this is  actually something based upon a traditional soup or   stew typically made with a combination of chili  pepper based goat meat adobo but in this case of   course it's going to be that shredded beef garlic  cumin bay leaves thyme and of course it's all   cooked at a low heat to simmer all that goodness  in and i can definitely confirm it's absolutely   aromatic because of that along with that we've  got cheese sour cream rice beans cabbage chopped   onions and normally cilantro but i definitely  don't roll with that but guys a very hefty   looking situation here in terms of the burrito it  really looks and smells pretty great and as for   the side kick which is actually one of the stars  of the show the consome dipping sauce which   is basically a richly flavored stock or broth that  we're going to be dipping into here guys and i got   to say also very aromatic and it's looking pretty  awesome so let's not waste any more time on this   one this is the all new birria burrito here at el  pollo loco let's peep out this flavor yeah very   aromatic this smells absolutely awesome guys and  of course having a nice hefty type of burrito on   a semi-rainy day here in southern cali is going  to go over pretty nicely in general i think so   guys one more time here take a look on the inside  as i have it flipped upside down for you plenty   of sour cream action right there in the upper  corner gotta say this is looking pretty great and   of course the aromatic goodness in there as well  let's go for a quick dip on this one get ourselves   outfitted for battle very very nice indeed wow i'm  already digging the way that this is looking and   smelling let's give this a go it's the birria  burrito here at el pollo loco let's peep this out this is the best this is the best wow super thick super rich and i gotta say guys that  shredded beef action on the inside is beautiful   I know it's a little contrasty because of the  weather outside but take a look at that lots of   tender shredded beef on this one plenty of beans  plenty of rice the sour cream action is amazing   but wow does it combine beautifully with this  consome dipping action right over here   let's keep going in because i am telling  you right now this is a flavor explosion   definitely the way to go it's thick  it's hearty and obviously i think   it's probably one of the best things on  the menu right now let's keep going in all day long oh my god yeah this half is not going  to last too long guys just feast your eyes on all   that goodness on the inside i am so digging this  right now the combination of everything together   along with that consome dipping action  is lighting this one up beautifully   and the nice toastiness of the actual tortilla  is very nicely done this is very hardy to hold   in the hand even just with this half very very  awesome in the flavor department and i gotta say   i'm very glad they loaded up the consome  dipping action with plenty of chopped onions   this time out i kind of took out a little  bit of the cilantro that you're seeing in   the very back over there but still guys plenty  of flavorful goodness on this one and it goes   amazing with all of the items over here at el pollo  loco that are featuring the shredded beef birria   on your screen right now you're probably  noticing the two reviews that i did recently   starting off with those crunchy tacos which was  a beautiful situation of crunchy goodness and   of course that was followed very closely  with the quesadilla which was a beautiful   situation and pretty much a precursor to  what i'm having here right now i think   so i guess yeah i did save the best for last  because the only thing i'm thinking this is   really missing is just some avocado that would  have been a serious situation but considering   how thick this is in general as you're going  to see here very very nice indeed so let's keep   going in guys because this is a banging situation  of consome dipping action goodness mixed in   with that birria action as well this is just really  really great let's keep going in for a couple more man it's so good and like i said in the stuffed  quesadilla review before this one for a chicken   spot that specializes naturally in chicken their  shredded beef is definitely a banging situation   just the presentation the overall flavor  the light saltiness that i'm getting which   is not nearly over the top on this but you  can taste all the flavor beautifully and   it's super fun to dip into guys just  a lot of fun checking this out today   so yeah i'm definitely down with this little hefty  sucker right now and i gotta say again it really   feels pretty awesome in the hand nice and large  and definitely packed with all the good stuff   let's go for one more bite we'll finish this one  up with the rating coming up next but guys again   a beautiful situation and just to outfit this  one for battle one more time for you definitely   an amazing profile to go with everything that  you're seeing here this is easily worth your time   if you've got el pollo loco in the area by far  one more bite we'll close this one out hang on all right so here's a shot of the other half and  let me just say one more time guys i sure did save   the best for last because this is easily the best  value out of all three it's the heartiest it's the   heaviest and it's the heftiest in terms of what  you're gonna get here in terms of the package   and when you combine that with the consome  dipping action of course it's going to be a   beautiful flavor situation as it has been the  last couple of times i've checked this one out   an easy recommendation to give this one a  go feed your sense of street food adventure   with new shredded beef birria from el pollo loco feed  the flame yeah man i'm telling you a half is all   you really need with that i mean i'm pretty much  satisfied right now just with what i've had here   on camera and let me just say the flavor profile  of everything with every bite was a beautiful   situation an easy recommendation like i said to  give this one a go it's super delicious so with   that said i'm going to have to give this birria  burrito as part of the shredded beef birria   here at el pollo loco an awesome 10 out of 10 guys  this really was the very top of the line for me   right now when it comes to the selections over  here definitely top tier in terms of flavor as   well as presentation and aroma and like i said  guys the dipping action and all those flavors   that came together once you went into that was a  lovely lovely lovely situation
