 hey everyone it's Ian K for peep this out reviews back on over at arbys because it looks like they have something on the menu that's 3 times the fun that's right so stay tuned because the triple decker club is up next welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty arbys is delicious so says the bad and I think the triple decker club is gonna make a serious case to prove that correct just in the looks department alone this looks really really delicious guys feast your eyes on this one they actually had this one spilt down the middle when I opened the package but take a look at the size this has definitely got some height to it and a serious meaty situation this is arbys after all lets take a look at this one here starting off on the very top we've got some honey wheat bread and underneath that it looks like some mayo we've got some pepper bacon a combination of cheddar cheese and swiss cheese and then comes the meaty goodness guys the roast beef the pit-smoked ham you've got the turkey we've got some tomato we've got some lettuce on the bottom there and on the very bottom it looks like we have got some spicy brown honey mustard to go with so really diggin this one here it looks like a serious appetite destroyer and its arbys it looks fantastic take a quick look on the other side here lovely situation indeed and guys I don't really get sandwiches from arbys too often but I have to admit this is definitely something I'm about to go in on right now with definite curiosity to see how it's gonna be cuz it looks really really great so let's see if the flavors gonna deliver on this one its the triple decker club at arbys let's peep out this flavor and as if this sandwich really needed anything else it's got red oinion for additional crunch on top of all the meat and all the goodness here guys man again this looks like a very lovely situation a lot of meaty goodness a lot of cheesy goodness and everything just lookin really really great very excited to get into this and we're about to do just that but like always if you guys are fans of high quality delicious looking food reviews make sure to hit that subscribe button down below and don't forget to tap that bell icon so you can be notified as soon as brand new content drops every week guys the triple decker club my first time having this over here at arbys let's go for it mmm a lot of meat oh yeah oh yeah man first off the dominate player in the first bite is easily gonna be all the meat a nice even mix of the roast beef, the turkey and that ham together and believe it or not the bacon coming up on the back end because there's just so much more of the other meat here naturally that bacon is adding a nice little residual amount of goodness on the very end there the smokiness the pepper goodness with it is good why they didn't call this like a quad decker club or something along those lines technically there's 4 meats on this I don't know but everything else is amazing so far let's go for another bite we'll keep giving you some closeups but guys delicious let's get you all up in that cross section one more time guys after a couple of bites in I'm very satisfied with the flavor on this one even with that tomato coming up on the backend with everything else there which I'm not really digging the flavor of everything else is overtaking in and the nice mustard hit that I'm getting on the very bottom on top of the mayo believe it or not it's a nice combination being that I'm not a huge fan of mayo I really like the fact that's it kind of there even though it's not really drenched but everything else that's on this completely drowning out that mayo flavor the spiciness of that mustard is good but again it's a meat showcase of epic proportions as it usually here at arbys and the quality is just amazing I'm really diggin' the fact that evenness of the meat is pretty good as well there's really no 1 meat that's dominating the other there's just a nice mix of all 3 of them and then you get the bacon and then of course that cheese the swiss I'm not really tasting the cheddar is coming through so very nice let's keep going with it yeah this is really tasty and you know what a nice little change of pace compared the regular star cut type of buns that they use over here at arbys having a sandwich this actually like more of a wholesome type of thing you might make at home just with a lot of meat and alot more of the other ingredients together I guess you can buy all this stuff individually but naturally with the signature roast beef here at arbys that's real stand out for me on top of the pit smoked ham so with all the meaty goodness you know what we gotta do right now right we have to go in on some horsey sauce let's crack this open and give it a shot alright so let's do a little horsey right here on this bite so as I take down that tomato it's not gonna be too much of a flavor issue because of all the sauce here and hey it's horsey sauce definitely one of my favorites let's do it mmm oh yes go to work on that tomato I don't taste you at all man that's good yeah the nice bite of that horsey sauce along with all those meats there of course it is absolutely a requirement every time you come to arbys as far as I'm concerned a lot of people are a fan of the arbys sauce but I am definitely a fan of the horsey with all these meats here guys this is really a lovely situation and it really brings out the overall flavor of everything together on top of that bacon that combination of the bacon and horsey together that horseraddish type consistency that its got the flavor I should say along with that just a lovely situation and guys again it's arbys it's gluttonous it's a lot of meat it's definitely delicious it really holds up to that arbys is delicious on the bag from earlier this si definitely bomb guys it really is one more bite we'll wrap this one after the rating and of course we're gonna give you another close up cuz why not guys it's arbys let's do it alright so let's just finish this one out with close up of the other half as as you can see I think just a half of this is really gonna be good for most people and as you can see again all the layers of goodness on display for you guys the combination of that swiss and cheddar is very nice the cheddar is the dominant player out of that the nice crunch of the onions along with everything else and the spicy mustard on the very bottom there goes amazingly well and of course the bacon the pit smoked ham the roast beef the turkey everything together with this one combines to give you a very lovely arbys experience all on some honey wheat bread so a nice change of pace with everything guys and again it's arbys it's truly delicious and definitely a recommendation especially with that horsey sauce arbys our drive thru is open so yeah that's about as full of a breakdown as I'm gonna get from something like that and I'm so glad that I've checked this one out here right now like I said a nice change pace from the standard buns that they use here at arbys the sandwiches are pretty awesome I just love the wholesome feeling of a very thick deli style sandwich and of course with all the mainstays that arbys is know for with their signature roast beef leading it off again that bacon is lovely situation as well and of course the signature horsey sauce to go with that really like I said is a requirement if you decide to go with it over here at arbys just delicious stuff all around so with that said I'm gonna have to give the triple decker club A.K.K. the quad decker club as far as I'm concerned because of the bacon on that a pretty rock solid 9 out of 10 take that tomato out and you've got an easy 10 out of 10 it's more of a preference anyway but as you can tell there's really nothing that you cannot like about that if you love all those ingredients in general it's just very delicious they just blend together beautifully and again horsey sauce added to the mix a beautiful situation great stuff alright so now the obvious question at least to me anyway is did this look like it was pretty much good stuff to you do me a fast favor drop those comments down below lemme know what you thought of the look of this triple decker club over here at arbys and being that it's a returning item on the menu my first time trying it
