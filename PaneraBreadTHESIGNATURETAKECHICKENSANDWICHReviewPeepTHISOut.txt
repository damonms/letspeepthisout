 what's going on everyone and welcome or welcome  back to the channel it's Ian K where today i'm   over at good old panera to take a look at one  of their all-new chef's chicken sandwiches   that's right and this one's supposed to be their  signature too so stay tuned because the signature   take chicken sandwich is up next welcome to  peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty all right so here we go with the all-new signature  take chicken sandwich part of the chef's chicken   sandwich selections here at panera bread guys and  as you can see it looks like we've got some nice   crispy action underneath this pan-seared chicken  breast i can't wait to get into this one but first   we got to break it down all right so right out  of the box it says bursting with flavor we've   got a very decent presentation here guys i have  to say that nice brioche roll is looking really   really solid and the size of the chicken so far  is looking decent as well let's pop the top and   take a look underneath and starting us off it  looks like we have a little bit of that garlic   aioli action along with some emerald greens but  guys as we pan down that's one of the main stars   of the show here the pan seared chicken breast  hormone-free chicken and i gotta say it is very   sizable it absolutely looks fresh and definitely  filling out this bun pretty nicely at the same   time underneath it and for some fun crunch no  doubt we've got some parmesan crisps and along   with more emerald greens and of course guys garlic  aioli all along the bottom of this one as well   there's a pretty plentiful amount of everything  so i think that's going to combine pretty nicely   with that chicken guys and again the pan seared  action is looking really really solid definitely   an upscale piece of chicken it's really looking  pretty great so let's not waste any more time on   this one this is the all-new signature take  chicken sandwich part of the chef's chicken   sandwich selections of panera bread let's peep  out this flavor man it's a mouthful of a title   signature take chicken sandwich i almost have some  trouble saying that guys but still it's all going   to be about the flavor regardless of what it's  called right so without further ado one more time   if i can say this correctly the signature take  chicken sandwich here at panera bread let's do it garlic aioli and the crispy  action right away that's good   not bad but admittedly though what i did  get of the chicken was a little on the dry   side and that really is one of the worries  i have when it comes to chicken breast but   at the same time guys that garlic aioli is  definitely helping but the meat so far is a   little dry let's keep going and i'll give you  that close-up but so far not too bad hang on well that second bite was much better and i  can definitely taste the pan-seared goodness   of that chicken very well with that guys it  really has a little bit more of an olive oil   type of fried to it which i'm really digging  you can really taste the fact that it really   feels like it was done in a pan and when  you combine that with that garlic aioli and   of course the parmesan crisps for a little  bit of added pungentness you really have a   pretty nice combination and a very soft  bun to go with but again the chicken's   a little on the dry side even though that  pan searing is coming through pretty nicely   yeah definitely a better second bite but guys all  i'm thinking right now is the fact that this was   twelve dollars definitely not worth the $12 price  point but again very flavorful either way because   of that garlic aioli that's really one of the  main stars of the show that's really lighting   this one up pretty nicely let's keep going in  for another couple on this one not too bad though yeah now it's continuing to become apparent guys  very very dry on the chicken breast and i've got   a lot of emerald greens falling all over me here  but still let me just keep showing this to you   it's not a bad choice when it comes to chicken  naturally because the quality is good but again   while the chicken breast is flavorful you really  can't fade the fact that that dryness is really   beginning to creep its head out every single bite  now it really is there but still like i said the   flavor of everything else is delivering on it and  speaking of the flavor those parmesan crisps are   absolutely adding to the goodness guys so let me  just kind of show you that hopefully that's going   to focus in just a little bit for you there you  go they're not bad they're flavorful pretty nice   definitely pungent and strong and of course  they go good with garlic as you'd expect   parmesan to go good with garlic right but  still i like the pan searing i like the   fact that you can see this was actually made  very fresh as you can see this quality chicken   hormone free definitely it's solid it's just  not as large in the thickness department   as it is wide i mean it really fills out the bun  nicely but guys again the quality issue that i'm   having with this is the chicken breast itself is  just really pretty much a dry thing right now so   let me go for one more bite we'll close the review  out with the rating coming up next but guys i'm   glad to have checked this out but $12 for this $12  come on one more bite and we'll close it out hang on well i'm thankful for the wrap that actually  comes around this chicken sandwich to help   catch some of the stuff falling out the back  but guys again the quality while i do love the   ingredients and everything that's on this the  fact that the chicken breast is not doing it   for me overall it's kind of a sad thing because  the searing it's on the outside of it is very   very solid and when you combine that with the  garlic aioli and those parmesan crisps you got a   pretty tasty deal here guys but i think i see why  they needed to have some garlic aioli in this one   to give you that added moisture but still it's not  masking it enough for my liking not bad overall   but like i said not worth $12 either well a couple  of wrap-up thoughts with this one guys i think   this particular chicken sandwich is definitely  not competing on price point i think you know   that right i mean $12 for chicken sandwich is a  little crazy that's more of a sit-down restaurant   type of deal and it's got to offer something  special and in this case the quality ingredients   are what they're pushing with it probably things  you wouldn't find at a regular fast food version   of something like that but again when you consider  some really solid chicken sandwiches are as low as   four bucks and the quality is pretty solid still  and the size is bigger guys that's really kind   of where that really hurts this particular one  because the price point's crazy but the quality   of the chicken itself is nowhere near up there  just the thickness department but i love the   pan searing that's the only thing but hey it is  what it is so with that said i'm gonna have to   give this mouthful of a title the signature take  chicken sandwich as part of the chef's chicken   sandwiches here at panera bread just an okay 7 out  of 10 you definitely want to have a drink handy   with this particular one because i'm telling  you no matter how much garlic aioli is on that   you may still have an issue because of the dryness  but at the same time that may just be something   that i experienced today with this particular  version that i'm doing the review on but still   solid quality for the flavor overall and again  i do love the fact that the garlic aioli goes   amazing with those parmesan crisps it's just that $12 for  that definitely not worth it all right so do me a   quick favor drop some comments down below let me  know what you thought of this particular chicken   sandwich over here at panera i mean the hype is  pretty real with it it's all over the restaurant   naturally but do me a favor let me know what you  thought of it and how do you think it compares to   some of the other chicken sandwiches that you've  had recently drop those comments down below and   definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K  closing out another high quality foodie feature   for you here on peep this out reviews bringing  you brand new content every single week here
