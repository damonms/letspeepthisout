 what's going on everyone and welcome or  welcome back to the channel it's Ian K   where today i'm over at little caesars to  check out a flavor of caesar wings that   doesn't appear to be too widely available  at least in my area anyway that's right you   already know it's the garlic parmesan caesar  wings so stay tuned because they're up next   welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay  frosty pizza pizza yes sir these definitely smell   pretty cheesy with nice hints of garlic guys  feast your eyes on what i'm looking at here   the caesar wings featuring garlic parmesan a  nice coating of goodness on the top of this   one guys this is actually presenting pretty  nicely let's break this one on down real quick   all right so it looks like what i've got here  is an eight piece order of mixed drums and flats   guys oven roasted goodness tossed in a creamy  garlic parmesan sauce very simple on this one   but still very very aromatic and they present  pretty nicely as i was saying earlier a very nice   combination of that garlic and parmesan goodness  it's really lighting up my car beautifully   and there definitely appears to be plenty of that  garlic parmesan sauce all throughout these wings   and for dipping just in case guys we're gonna  go in on some of their butter garlic flavor   here i'm definitely gonna be adding a little bit  more garlic to this one but overall a very nice   presentation and very aromatic i gotta say so  there you go it's the garlic parmesan version   of their oven roasted caesar wings here at  little caesars let's peep out this flavor   yes sarah a very lovely portion of that garlic  parmesan goodness that's spread out all over   these drums and flats guys i have to say not bad  in the aromatic and presentation department but   i got to be real with you for a second i'm really  kind of surprised this is not available at every   little caesars in my area just by casually  looking around i came across the one location   that had these and it happens to be the same one  that actually had the early version of the cookie   dough brownie featuring twix that i reviewed not  that long ago which is probably jumping up on your   screen here right now but guys when i saw this  was available on the menu and it wasn't anywhere   close to me this was a few miles away i definitely  wanted to jump over and give this a shot so let's   do just that let me pick up one of these here  and go for it very nice fairly meaty on this as   you can see a nice amount of that goodness let's  give this a go guys my first time trying these the   garlic parmesan variant of the oven roasted caesar  wings here at little caesars let's peep this out mmm okay all right well it's definitely more  cheesy than anything else and i guess given the   aroma is more cheese to begin with there there's  not so much garlic that i'm really tasting on this   but very very cheesy like i said guys  fairly meaty on this wing as well   it's cooked all the way through very nicely here  and guys personally for me you got to go for the   bone-in wings these are really the way to go  very lovely situation on this let's go for   another few more bites in this and of course  we're gonna be getting into that dip hang on okay not bad you know this has already taken  me back to the oven roasted caesar wings that   i did about four years ago actually i believe  it was during the spring time when i did that   you're probably seeing that review jumping  up on your screen here right now as well   very lovely with that one and i believe i did  like a buffalo ranch or some type of ranch that   i dipped into but guys this on its own i have  to admit it's more of a subdued type of flavor   it's more cheesy and that's fine but you can  really taste the oven roasted goodness of the   wing pretty nicely on this one i only wish  there was a little bit more garlic up front   but i'm glad that i got that butter garlic  flavor to go with just for that reason alone   just to be on the safe side let me  just knock this one off real fast they are tasty though the oven roasted goodness is  really good on this flavor is nice on their own it's really good actually all right because you can never have too much  garlic and in this case i wish i had more garlic   anyway i'm glad that i picked up some of this  butter garlic flavor to go with over here guys   so i am excited to dip into this of course it's  going to add some of that margarine goodness   the butter goodness that it has here and  it's going to be very very nice i think   overall this is already looking very thick  let me grab one of these here wow this is   going to be a little difficult here let me  try and keep the focus for you there we go   all right let's go into this action you  can't really fade the fact that garlic   is very much needed with this and honestly  my experience so far is good again i wish   it was just a little bit better on its own i  think this is going to enhance it let's do it oh crazy strong garlic now oh man this is the  way to go the cheesy action along with the   buttery flavor and then the garlic is very rich  very strong wow let's just keep going in on this   very very nice guys hopefully that focus is  staying there for you this is really good mmm   oh wow that parmesan is coming to life big time   why they didn't just douse some of this  along with it wow that is very strong guys i am enjoying this right now all right let  me go for a flat because i want to see if i can   try and take it down in one bite hopefully  i can here we go this is a nice one here   i've got the edge there we go guys crazy flavorful  on this one this is the real this is the dipping   sauce of choice to go with this the parmesan  is amazing if you've got this flavor in your   local area drop some comments down below let me  know if you've actually seen these in your area   this is the flavor to go with and if you've  had them do you actually dip it in the butter   garlic flavor because this is a banging situation  let's go for this whole one let's give it a shot wow the flavor is crazy on this guys that's great banging situation banging  as i'm almost losing the wing all right so let's go for one more bite of this  guys because i'm thoroughly enjoying myself with   this i have to say the flavor is really off  the chart in the parmesan department i only   wish on its own it had a little bit more like  garlic flavor naturally but the fact that you   can pair it up with that butter garlic  action is a lovely situation in general   it's just unfortunate you have to buy the  side to really bring out the garlic that   this is supposed to have anyway but still  very tasty we're gonna go for one more   bite we'll wrap the review up with the rating  coming up next which we're gonna do right now   so let me just go for this dip for you real fast  here guys and uh we will definitely light this up   this is a very lovely situation let me try and  take most of this down in one bite here we go a little difficult but tasty well here's another quick look at one of  the flats guys and honestly very very tasty   on this one like i said all throughout the  review i do wish these wings had a little   bit more meat on them but what you're getting  here is very flavorful it's fairly satisfying   considering the eight piece order and at the  same time again i wish the garlic just stood out   just a little bit more on its own but it's really  great that you can add that butter garlic action   to go with it because that's what really brings  this one out very tasty overall though really is   pizza pizza all right so based upon my experience  with these today i'm gonna have to give the garlic   parmesan variant of the oven roasted caesar wings  here at little caesars just an OK   7.9 out of 10 and i'm not going to go much higher than that  because guys like i said all throughout the review   the garlic itself is not very strong on this  one initially i thought it was in the beginning   but it's more of a parmesan showcase on  top of the oven roasted wings now that's   fine but considering the flavor of this is garlic  parmesan you want a little bit more of that again   the flavor of the butter garlic is coming through  very nicely once you dip it into that goodness   but guys on its own like i said it needs to be  just a little bit more pungent and at $8.99 now   for eight of them i think the last time i did this  it was like $5.99 for the regular side inflation is   crazy right now at nine dollars for this i don't  think it's worth that but at the same time super   fun to check out and something i would recommend  trying at least once all right so like i mentioned   earlier in this review do you guys actually have  this flavor available i mean have you had this one   in the past drop some comments down below and let  me know your thoughts on this particular one and   overall how do you think the presentation of these  was in my review today did you like what you saw   drop those comments down below and definitely  let me know and with that
