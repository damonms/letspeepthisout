you're doing  everything you can and that's all we can do so   um big hugs to you sister sister if you're  there and you haven't checked in just yet   uh let's see here maureen descritado thanks so  much for jumping on great to see you sean hickok   standing sorry had a week thanks for spicy pizza  hut reviews though yes a lot of fun with that   there a lot of fun with the uh with the pizza hut  goodies that was done well over a week plus ago   um i was actually on a virtual stream watching  this little presentation which was really cool   they actually sent over a couple of the pizzas  um as well too that way it was two of the same   one which was the spicy the double pepperoni  but it really really fun immediately right   after that basically did the the content and made  something in there as well um obviously i said in   the video if you've watched that naturally there  that that wasn't no way directed to do that but   i wanted to make content because it's what i do  for you guys it's perfect for it um but it was   great to put out and just a lot of fun to check  out and definitely um there'll be some other   reviews coming down the line to give those things  adequate time to show the other variations of them   um as well i have to check out the comments to  see what you guys are putting on there to see   which one you want me to start off with next um  either the hawaiian chicken or the veggie lovers   but that was a lot of fun to put together and the  great people actually working with their marketing   team from xeno group it was really really cool i'm  a lot of fun with that for sure uh let's see here   umkar baxter will you do more papa john's reviews  of course there's a few things that are coming up   for that so do not worry do not worry uh let's  see randy molina super bowl meals like jalapeno   poppers potato skins fried mozzarella sticks  barbecue baby back ribs are delicious yes to all   of that yes to all of that that actually sounds  pretty amazing really really good stuff there   so brady hiller who you uh who's your super  bowl matchup but you know i really couldn't   say i haven't really been following too too much  to some of the games um but i just i just like   i said the event itself is what i really look  forward to getting making sure we have our stuff   all decked out food wise and just enjoying the day  and just kind of zoning out uh with it but we'll   see we'll see what happens here i'm just excited  just to have the um another year of the super bowl   here which is always fun to watch hopefully it's  just an exciting game um it's not a blowout on   one end or the other that's what i'm excited for  for sure and that's cervantes i appreciate the   good thoughts as well thank you thank you thank  you good times across the board once we get past   a few things uh let's see here and that's we're  getting a dutch uh brother's coffee in the area   soon cool not sure if you have that one near  you i haven't heard of that i haven't heard of   dutch brothers is that more of like a regional  thing and maybe a little bit further down in   san diego i've never heard of um dutch brothers  coffee i'm sure they have their own specialties   of all the stuff that we normally get on all the  other places i'm sure so that's got to be good   uh jack parker says spicy hawaiian chicken is my  favorite nice nice nice well see i have a feeling   it's probably going to start off with that one  and then go into the veggie uh from there so   we'll see we'll see what happens with that but it  was a lot of fun making that video that intro and   just putting everything together it was a lot of  fun uh to produce you all know about i'm trying to   put out that high quality stuff for you naturally  there and give you all the b-roll goodness um and   just make it a little bit more exciting that's  what i love to do and i'm glad that you guys   are digging that video uh for sure i have to go  back and see how things are going with that video   actually just so you guys know whenever i release  my stuff i'm usually coming back to check to see   how things are going a few days later i used to  check it pretty much almost every day um just to   kind of see but now i kind of put my things out  and then i kind of i'm already moving into the   second or third thing after that um so i have to  come back and see what's happening there as well   but definitely there's a few of the reviews  that i've seen actually on there big ben   over at something new i think has one of  the best ones out there that i've seen there   that personality i'm telling you on big ben is  pretty infectious over there it's something new   uh definitely check out his video he definitely  uh not spoiler alert to give it away but he   definitely enjoyed the pizza as well um it's  just a dynamite looking pie especially the   double pepperoni variant of it there it looks  amazing with those jalapeno peppers and believe   me i wanted to drop some little hints for that  in the last stream that we had because that was   going to be coming naturally um but the very next  day since we're talking about it anyway let's just   get into the content here because we're kind of  going down that road as you guys already know from   the pallet box fiesta review from jollibee from  the week uh prior uh the secret one was actually   the peanut butter crunch mcflurry which i gotta  tell you every time my sister watches that one   she's like i have to come by and we need to go get  that and i'm like yes we do because they have it   over here very close to where i live and it's  uh it's definitely an incredible mcflurry that   thing just needs to be everywhere it really does  it is really good i mean you can't beat you know   peanut butter chocolate chip goodness that is in  there as well the chocolate goodies and of course   the crunchiness of the cookies and the timeless  familiar flavor of the vanilla soft service so i   think you guys know that combo is just beautiful  uh guys the batman calzonia super fun video   um to put together i mean i'm a huge batman fan  you guys already know that so i was when i saw   that i was like that is so dynamite looking and  it's going to be delicious because it's the crazy   calzone that i reviewed already so being that i  had done the cheese variant it was so obvious to   go in and do the regular pepperoni one now and it  made so much sense to actually just put that out   the very next day after that came out it was a lot  of fun to do and i had just a blast just a blast   to do that one it looks amazing that that thing  looks amazing it's one of my favorite thumbnails   oh for sure aside from the one from pizza hut  which i'm really digging the double pepperoni from   the spicy lovers pizza there's a lot of good stuff  there as well um i actually had that one out at 6   a.m that morning um it was kind of like a little  bit of a tie-in in terms of some of the news stuff   as well too that way so it was kind of really fun  to do and then naturally the push later in the day   for it there but definitely a fun video to put  together and a great pizza to check out pizza   hut definitely did it up right um regardless  the fact that they sent it to me of course my   opinions are always my own and you heard me say  that and of course i have all the disclaimers   down in the description box and per youtube's  policies posted up in the very beginning of the   review as well so you'll see that paid promotion  that's there just to make sure there's no   issue and i'm always in compliance i'm  always about doing it legit you already know   and then today the big gun uh this one here  i've actually had done for a little bit there   the triple bacon beast burger that was just an  insane situation to check out a few nights ago   um really really amazing in terms of the  amount of meat on that there but like i said   had that actually come out around halloween time  that would have been technically what it should   have been a monster angus stick burger because of  the quantity of the meat and all the greenery that   it had and everything as well it was just really  really tasty um the whole bacon beast menu thing   is a little bit of an over stretch i think for  what it is because all it really is is two extra   pieces of bacon essentially on top of what they're  advertising there so the other two items they have   on the menu if you guys want to see those two  because i'm on the i'm on the fence with it   because i've done variations of them in the past  um of course drop some comments down below here   in the uh in the stream as well as in the replay  of course there if you're checking this out after   the fact and i'll i'll probably swing on back  and give that a go maybe that's like a quickie   uh to do but like i said the beast mode for what  it is it's really the size of the burger itself so   three patties is gluttonous it was a little  over 12 bucks for it but it was such a blast   to film and there's some gorgeous footage  in that video if you haven't seen it yet   um it looks like you guys are enjoying that  one here i'm seeing some performance stuff   here on it already there so it looks like  you guys are digging that one um it was   really really fun to check out so naturally  good times good times indeed uh with that   uh let's see ed keaton did you catch the latest  batman trailer yes i have including the 30 second   fear spot uh which is out right now so good times  across the board with that trav trav what's going   on trav tries is in the house guys i appreciate  all of the uh the prayer hands that i'm seeing   here as well and i will convey that to uh mama  peeps it's been a little bit hard to get in   touch with her this past week because of things  that have been going on uh but we'll definitely   make sure that that's actually relayed to her and  i know that she loves uh watching these replays   and watching it live and she sees the comments  and all those things as well so uh i appreciate   that thank you thank you thank you valerie ransom  i love your food reviews keep up the awesome work   prayers and well wishes from cold south carolina i  hope you are staying toasty over there not frosty   staying toasty like my boy michael domeier who  definitely needs to be it's a chilly 11 degrees   in detroit oh my god that is that's crazy but  i got to be honest considering the crazy of   fire weather that we've had over here in the last  few months michael i would rather take that right   now and deal with that a little bit than what  what we did deal with earlier but good times   james morris and anyone from eternity are going  to be joining us tonight no not tonight i'm all   caught up when we took a look at the strider  masters of the universe strider last week   as well so everything that i have showcased  already is all current now um so i think we should   be okay well probably with the exception of a con  exclusive that's hiding behind faker uh right over   here actually up above so we'll have to see but  let's see annette peanut butter mcflurry something   about that just grosses me out you gotta taste it  though it's really good it's really really good   batman calzone there's a lot of reviews jumping  out with the batman calzones for sure in there as   well erna super chat donation jumping in again  right over here for the first time along with   bus we've got two of you guys in there as well  let me see if there is a who knows cheap trick   the flame oh that's a classic song it's one of  those anthems back in the day with that let's   see who else knows that oh for sure so trav  dropped his uh crazy calzone review as well   something new as well big ben did it as well too  that way um there's a lot of peeps that are out   there that are dropping these in my name just it i  believe um fast food pit stops justin actually did   it as well um rdr food reviews everybody naturally  is jumping out with this freddy foodie king   really really good stuff um across the board  and it's always great to see the community just   light up whenever these things come out it's a  lot of fun um definitely there let's see here   let's see sean hickox yeah mcflurry  machine is quote-unquote working   guys i was in a crazy windstorm when i filmed that  it was a little unnerving um for the first time   in a very long time we literally had over 50 plus  mile an hour winds my car i had some stabilization   stuff on my on the video um but some of it you can  still kind of see i mean my car was kind of like   you know you can feel it doing its thing so it was  kind of like me wanting to get through that review   and get home as quick as i can um but i was just  enjoying myself so much with that and it was just   a lot of fun to do there's a lot more i want to  call it quote unquote dynamic type of filming that   i'm trying to do where you're going to see a lot  longer stretches of content in there without so   many like edits for certain things as well i'm  kind of streamlining a few things as well too   and yes larry not to worry the udon noodles is on  the docket i do have that one planned do not worry   there's a few people that have been asking for  that one uh for sure it's just the timing that's   one of the next ones that i have to do i have  about three or four already locked already um so i   have to actually do the uh that one i'm sure i'll  get to in due time there as well so there's a few   things locally here which you guys may have seen  on some of the websites that i plan on checking   out um it's gonna be a pretty busy beginning of  february for me and that's okay because that's   beautiful content and it's more content for you  guys so i'm looking forward to putting that out   for sure but um yeah crazy win situation with that  i mean like the very beginning it was so funny and   there was a like a a station wagon or some some  type of suv-ish type of thing in front of me   and they were just i just saw cone after cone  going into this car and i guess they got like a   whole bunch of people that were in there they were  out that night late getting ice cream which is fun   to do actually uh for those types of things but i  was like you know shouting to thinking to myself   they're probably thinking hallelujah the ice cream  machine's working right so when i got that that   thing was just made amazing it really was made  pretty amazing right now good times indeed it's   got messy schmidt what's going on snack snacking  coal made his own bk sandwich only in hawaii   very cool i know they're doing the test markets  for the melts and everything out the way i know   ed keaton of course here we go we're getting  caught up i'm trying to see right over here   hopefully it's not too delayed i'm trying not to  talk too much while the thing stretches up um but   yes the new batman trailer of course very excited  um great product that they came out with little   caesars that's like the ultimate tie-in um there's  really nobody else who can do something like that   aside from some of the other pizza companies which  obviously i don't think they're gonna follow suit   because now that little caesars has the license  um that really is a huge thing right there so   and that's cervantes triple burger gang yes it was  so much fun to check out and yes tony we're just   talking about the batman pizza of course always  take a look at my playlist or do a quick search on   youtube before you ask those questions you may be  pleasantly surprised you can watch something and   concurrently with this as we're doing our thing  i've chances are i've done it already for sure   chief's sake hopefully i said that correctly  there hope you're doing well mr k mr ian k i   appreciate that thank you thank you thank you i'm  doing uh doing okay you know it's just uh it is   what it is this week it is what it is let's see  mountain dew is coming out with hard baja blast   yes actually they have a whole section of uh quote  unquote spiked drinks uh for with the mountain dew   label that's gonna be pretty cool actually that's  something i may have to check out that definitely   i should say that's definitely something i need  to check out um yes the full funeral scene is   available online right now i did not want to watch  that because i i want to go in completely raw i'm   aside from some of the little preview things that  i've already seen online actually i don't want   to watch any extended scene and just little clips  are fine i just don't want to ruin too much of the   movie waited this long for it uh so for sure mark  grayson can you do the signature joey's world tour i can't do it with the eyes though the way he does  it but that's as far as i'm gonna get with that   mark just so you know uh erno what about george  michael's faith and father figure yes classics   those are all both classics absolutely both  classics you already know let's see erin already   actually i should say you guys should know that  earn is our 80s aficionado when it comes to music   i mean there's always constant trivia throughout  the hour it's always a good time with that always a good time all right  randy molina did you try the um   public mixer oots public pub mix i have not  no that brand is actually a little bit more   specialized usually you can find that at world  market or cost plus here which is kind of a   specialty that um they come basically a store  that goes into like international brands and   things that you can get overseas um and some of  the things in their more regional areas across the   country and that's one of them that you can find  that stuff there but i haven't been the cost plus   um in a long time actually i  haven't gotten in there for a bit   uh just for a little bit i would get a few things  i think the last thing i got in there was the   the gummy i can't remember the name of the company  it was like these gummy candies that looked like   a little like lunchbox uh stuff it was kind of it  was an international thing i know there's like a   little gummy burger gummy pizza gummy fries i did  a while back it was a with a very specific brand   uh to check out that was the last time that i'd  been in the cost plus uh to check that out there yes i do miss the holiday pie at mcdonald's  absolutely i know it's completely gone now so we   have to wait another 10 months plus to get that  back drew i didn't get the batman box for your   calzone that's no bueno i got to take a look and  see what you thought of that one there drew that   one is again very delicious to check out but yeah  the box is pretty cool um on that there really is   i love the whole batman logo being those pieces  of the gun you know that kind of uh killed his   parents from what i understand it really is  a very different take and just overall just   something different but it looks cool you know  every time they come out with these batman movies   you wonder what they're going to do with the bat  symbol to kind of change it a little bit here and   there give different interpretations but you can't  beat the 1989 original they always come back to   that for the merchandising you see that all over  the place it's really cool for sure uh let's see   better we see spike baja replace your water yes  we'll have to see and then we'll see how long the   stream goes uh with that annette if i'm drinking  a little bit of a spike baja blast situation   depending upon how many volumes are in there we'll  have to see uh misty smith didn't see you there i   was watching the wiggles cool well thank you for  jumping on i appreciate that i appreciate that   yes the e fruity lunch bag gummies drew  that's it that's exactly it it was that   misty you're having sonic drive-in  what are you having at sonic right now they have those double stuffed oreo blasts and  mocha whipped drinks or things like that as well   too but what are you actually having over there  if you're watching this actually at sonic which   by the way thank you so much for spending a little  bit of your time your sonic eating time with me   right now and the rest of the amazing peeps here  in the house we've got an awesome bunch of you   guys here right now take a look over there 38  plus i always get that confused once in a while   uh i'm seeing it reversed on my side every time  i'm doing this stuff so it happens right now lord   darkseid ian gets drunk on the stream watch that  could possibly happen right there you already know   you already know you already know   uh let's see erna what about the song glendaros  nothing's gonna change my love for you another big   hit 1987. i need to hear that one that one doesn't  sound familiar to me for some reason maybe some of   the lyrics need to come out there we'll have to  see misty seven chicken strips tater tots french   fries vanilla shake and a sweet wow that's a party  right there you are definitely going in on it   that's for sure chicken strips there i think  i've done a review back in the day actually for   that as well as some of the other chicken stuff  there as well sonic's a little hit or miss for me   as you guys know but um they're legendary for  their drinks and their desserts i think you   guys know that as well too and that's cervantes  albany's gummy bears the best gummy bears ever   i like the harbor ones just the regular ones  to be honest but i'm sure anything it sounds   like it'd be like an international version  there what's the difference with uh albany's   gummy bears in that compared to the regular ones  i'm a sour patch kids guy myself i love sour   sour patch kids um sour watermelon slices you  know sour peaches you know i love those types   of candies those are my favorite types of candies  over like chocolate you know as well too there are   you guys fans of like you know gummy candies  over like chocolate traditional candies like   that because i personally love um gummy candies  that are sour it's just kind of a vice with me   as well red vines of course they have a special  place in my heart um definitely that let's see   missy smith what do you like to eat at sonic you  know i don't go there often outside of reviewing   there's really nothing that makes me want to go  but i have to admit i really did enjoy the pickle   slushie back in the day when they did that that  was actually very fun to check out um so some   of their drinks and some other things i can see  myself going back to get again but some of the   regular food items i i can't find myself ordering  their stuff on the side but the garlic but the   garlic butter burger that they have which recently  has come back a few times over the years i've done   that initially um really tasty i can see myself  going in on that again but naturally that pickle   slushie holds a special place because it was  different and i really enjoyed that you think that   would be kind of nasty but it was actually it was  pretty good and yes dom dom's world what's going   on ghostbusters afterlife coming to dvd february  1st nice can't wait to see it it's a very cool   movie um it'll definitely get you in the feels  naturally for what it is it's really um it'll uh   it'll appeal to a lot of the peeps there who grew  up with the original one back in 84 as well as   naturally some of the newer stuff that's out there  as well it's a nice bridge for how they do it really good stuff there as well so let's see  another couple of minutes we're gonna get into   the review here guys we're almost to the halfway  point larry nguyen have you had saltwater taffy   yes but not in a very long time not in a very long  time i like that stuff though wacky taffy and a   few other things that was a little bit more harder  on the teeth naturally but yes i definitely dig it   for sure harbor gummies are tough in my opinion  albany's gummies are soft and the flavor is so   good cool that could be the preservative they use  too that way so the fresher the gummy you know   the softer it is um yes i always remember that  line at the end of i think it's ferris bueller   where um the crazy principal i guess the guy who's  after ferris gets onto the school bus at the end   and then he sits next to the girl and i  think it's the girl that says you know   would you like a gummy bear it's warm  and soft because it's been in my pocket   or something like that for like for a while  and he looks over like oh my god shoot me now   um hilarious i remember that instantly when  you just talked about that and that i just   i just took me back to that scene really  fast that's hilarious uh that's hilarious let's see k-woods 831 name your top  five go-to fast food chains that aren't   exclusive wow that aren't exclusive i'm gonna say mickey d's because it's classic no particular  order by the way this is not like you know   in terms of just the overall uh one to five  right we're going here top five uh if i say   the first one that's not the first one naturally  there but i'm gonna say um that's not regional   i'm gonna say mickey d's wendy's carl's jr because  that counts because hardy's is considered the same   so if you guys have hearties nine times out of ten  it's the same thing uh from there um i would say   papa john's let's see one two three i think that's  four uh and dominoes i would say that's maybe tied   with pizza hut man i mean i like pizza fast food  pizza naturally but given that the main three   i think personally for me are going to be wendy's  mcdonald's um and then naturally going into uh   carl's jr hardy slash those are kind of like the  main group from there so i think i think that   works for me no particular order though in terms  of

nyc on the outskirts of the nyc james   morrison wow you listen to john carpenter music  while you work kind of sinister kind of of course   the halloween theme but i love the theme from the  fog it's very haunting especially when i do a lot   of my stuff late night and that's really where i  really kind of really get into it when it's very   quiet and i have my headphones on it's always  very cool with that there for sure good times or no chris hansen are you the host from  the catch of predator that's hilarious misty smith almost time for the food review  fingers crossed right coming up here

say a couple of weeks ago and i said  to myself i'm going to have to check that out   and i figured since i was doing my thing the  last few days and i happen to see these i'm   like okay this will be the week that i do this  because i think it's going to be very very tasty   um it looks very cool and i'm very much  digging the way that it looks actually   so we'll have to see let's see yes  boys tomato listen to earn absolutely   so hard to say goodbye to yesterday all the good  stuff over there you already know you already know   okay so because misty is ready for it as well and  i think you guys are ready for it on top of that   if you are ready for the review right now let me  see a flame right over here let me see a flame on   the inside of the chat and uh we'll get this party  started over here i was bombed they didn't get to   try taco bell's wings hopefully they'll bring them  back helena i think they're gonna bring them back   personally for me i think they will it was fun  checking him out in test market the first time   um but naturally uh yes i'm looking forward to uh  seeing them come back again they're huge huge you   know amount of interest in that so i think they  were testing that to see what the take rate was   going to be i'm sure we'll see them back at some  point with something different all right so we   got a bunch of flames in effect here right now so  it looks like you guys are ready for this to go   and look how quickly you guys are assuming is this  the doritos flaming hot ranch doritos could it be   should it be won't you be my neighbor  that's so bad bad dad joke bad that joke wow you guys really wanted to be that  that's so crazy because if you ask me   this package looks like fire it looks like  absolute fire and i had to actually check this   out because when i saw this i'm like wow that just  looks really really good the ultimate chocolate   flavor cream oreo guys i mean just crazy you can't  tell me that doesn't look like fire look at that   package if you're a fan of chocolate like i am  you already know this just looks ridiculously good   ridiculously good look at the size of those  layers if you guys have ever been to claim jumper   they have something called the mother lode cake  it's like a chocolate cake with literally it looks   like maybe 15 layers that look like this so really  really tasty i know you guys i said the flame for   a reason because this thing looked like fire but  you guys automatically assumed it was gonna be   something heated but no tonight it is all about  chocolate goodness ultimate chocolate flavor cream   oreos right now and i know my sister's watching  this and i know you're down with the gluten-free   ones that we got like a few days ago and that's  really good but you're gonna have to try this   after i try it especially if it's really tasty it  looks pretty amazing right now and that we used   to have clam jumper but never went to it it was  definitely it's a really really good place they   actually closed up shop over here because of the  pandemic unfortunately but their cake was amazing   this thing was very reminiscent of that and it  took me back as soon as i saw it it just looks   amazing guys i mean just just look at that package  one more time it is just so awesome it is just so   awesome so i can't wait to give this a shot and  of course you guys may have noticed i've been   sipping very lightly because i've actually got a  nice little frosty glass of almond milk in over   here and it's the khalifa brand so it's got some  richness it's thick we're gonna simulate some of   this stuff here as well and we'll see what goes  on here we got tricked yes mr jimmy you guys did   right there but there you go we're gonna get into  it right now the ultimate chocolate flavor cream   and just so you know mr jimmy i'm still  working on those ranch pickle chips from lays   really really good stuff here all right  let me pull this label because this is   already not working there we go okay i'm gonna  see if i can try and do this very carefully and   pull it towards you because you guys can get  the first look as we pull this back carefully that's how you know it's legit take a look on the  inside right there looking very nice very wow wow wow very strong very chocolatey on this right now  i can already see i could smell it right when i   held it up right now this is this is crazy uh e  noel this is not gluten free clearly so forgive me   but look at this madness look at this madness  right now that is like it looks almost double   stuff there's like two layers of cream it looks  like on one of these this is ridiculous wow it is   very strong in chocolate and look at  the thickness of this cream oh my god   let me see if i can try and there we go look  at that let me try and focus focus focus   my focus needs focus you can see it there it is  so it looks like two or three different layers   in there guys it's just really  really strong look at that man okay   of course we are going to crack this open  first to see triple stuffed michael domey   says they are very rich this is really two  different types of flavored cream it looks like   on here but it is thick look at that there's  three layers you can see it very distinct   right there i have never seen an oreo like this  three different layers in but the chocolate is on   point with that man i already feel diabetes  coming on just looking at this real quick so   let me try the cream by itself real fast  here and then of course we're going to put   it together and give it a shot go for a dunk  and knock this one out so let's see here guys   the ultimate chocolate chip ultimate chocolate  oreo cookie i should say from oreo here we go oh oh yeah that is very rich that is like  pasty rich that is pretty thick all right   so we got it together get it together ian  get it together there we go look at that   beautifully on display for you right there  crazy guys here we go let me just show this   again hashtag unsponsored there we go the ultimate  man i'm getting already i'm excited let's do it and close my eyes for this hold on wow wow oh that other layer it's chocolatey right up front  and then the thickness begins to come out because   your mouth is beginning to water and absorb  all of it and it gets a lot thicker from there wow this is good it is rich michael you're  right it is very rich but um oh my god i'm impressed i am impressed look at all  of that chocolate cream on this one trying   to showcase it here but i'm definitely  having another one of those we're going   to dunk the second one because i  want to knock this one out first oh my god banging banging all right one more and i am bringing these to my sister amazing best oreos yet i'm seeing  comments here okay let's do the dunk crazy delicious guys look at that look at those  layers right there it is simulating chocolate cake   beautifully i am blown away by this  so we're gonna go for a dunk in there   hopefully that's staying as focused as  it possibly can let's give this a shot um oreos come alive with milk wow this was  already strong to begin with oh my god guys this is absolutely heavenly  right now this is so so good yeah the cakesters i have to see about those too i  want to try that ma'am ma'am last one here god it   is very hard not to have more than one of these i  gotta tell you very very hard this is really good wow i am impressed okay to my sister i won't  bring the whole package i'll bring you some to   try because i definitely want to keep these  these are really good these are really good   180 calories for two that's not bad at  all considering how rich and thick and   this really does satisfy your itch  for chocolate chip cookie or that's   an ultimate type of chocolate situation that  chocolate chip it's very strong in that flavor   and i love the duality of the creams i didn't even  notice this on the package but they even show you   the three creams right there on the package  i don't know why i kept focusing on the cake   because i love the packaging right there i kept  like wow it's got to simulate that and guys it   does let me get that glare out of the way look at  that you have the three levels that are in there   it really is pretty awesome guys this is a 10 out  of 10 easily all day long with this really really   good sweetness level it's rich it's up there  but the creamy vibe that you're getting with   this one and the overall satisfaction of having  something chocolatey this really is pretty awesome   so the ultimate chocolate flavored oreo by far  this really does satisfy an itch because i'm a   huge fan of chocolate cake like i was saying the  mother lode cake over at um clam jumper even the   blackout cake that they have a cheesecake factory  it's one of my all-time favorite things i love to   get when i go with the wifey um this is gonna  scratch that itch whenever i feel like having   something like that and i shouldn't have to feel  too bad about it because it's just two for 180   calories too right but guys easy recommendation  about 350 for the pack 2.99 three bucks on sale   easy recommendation you need to search these  out the ultimate chocolate flavored cream   this is a banging variant of oreos  easily one of the best ones by far   nice way to start the year off oreo uh with  something like this this is pretty awesome   now i gotta try that toffee crunch that i saw as  well too so if you guys want to see the toffee   crunch drop some comments down below let me know  what you thought of that but that is an easy 10.   easy there's nothing wrong with that that  is d-lish wow absolutely shocked by that   i knew it was going to be good because of how  much cream it looked like it was going to have   i just didn't know it had that much in terms of  with those layers the way they had it there it was   cool to check that out there so limited edition by  far do have some milk on hand though just in case misty smith on a scale of one to ten how  would you rate your oreo chocolate dip   well with milk it's still it's a ten plus uh  when you have it with milk but on its own that   cookie satisfies that really really satisfies  very tasty very tasty i should say very tasty   uh erna coffee crunch or coffee crunch toffee  crunch is even better please try it okay   i'll swing by and grab those maybe we'll see about  that uh for next week or the week after we'll see   the salted toffee oreos i'll definitely  give that a try they had plenty of each of   those when i was at my market a few days ago so  i'll definitely check them out they were really   like i said when i saw that i'm like okay i  gotta do it we gotta do it it looks really   good but the creaminess the overall flavor was  just a banging situation on that by far by far   uh pcs of 2019 united 2050. thanks so much  happy friday legendary fast foodie thank   you appreciate you thank you thank you thank  you thank you stacks has the best oreos yet   and drew we did the dunking you already know drew  they are the ultimate chocolate situation yes   and that i will save some for you guys  absolutely i will save some for you guys   well i hope you guys are having an amazing  start to your weekend already there i'm   going to be catching up on um the book of boba  fett i have to watch the last episode tonight   um there's a few other things that i want to  check out there but naturally just boba fett i try   and get to the day that it comes out but i just  couldn't this week uh for sure and e noel says no   don't bring them here probably i'll bring you  some to try you gotta try at least two i'll   bring four just in case um but really tasty really  tasty yes he he tasey i could have said tazzy but   then drew would be like how does he know about  my cat i mean like we know about ziggy and tazzy wow don't bring them over e noel says come on  what would a good brother be without tormenting   his sister every so often by just dangling the  carrot right over there it was really tasty   really really tasty let's see lara new year  have you heard of a chocolate cake shake well i   wouldn't doubt it i'm sure they have things that  are whipped up with like cake pieces and things   like that anything from specifically at some of  the places um speaking of which it's been a minute   since we've had anything from bk shake wise as  well i always love checking out the shakes from bk   um too so um any of those types of things are  always going to be good oh for sure michael i   heard a little debbie's in huttsville ice cream  were teaming up for making seven different flavors   after their christmas tree cake ice cream was  a hit wow very cool i'm sure we'll see that at   some point um during the year there was a lot of  interesting things coming out which by the way   guys i think for easter i know it's probably not  too far off to talk about that now considering   it's almost february um but there's two brand  new flavors of peeps coming out one of them i   think is a coffee flavored peep dipped in  chocolate with uh caramel inside it um i   was i was hearing so and there's actually another  flavor that i heard i can't remember what it was   um i was up very early in the morning it was  like six in the morning and i was driving   and i heard this it was really quick um and i was  just tripping out on just like you know the coffee   flavored version i think when i that's what stuck  out but the fact that i think it's the first peep   to actually have something injected into it um  that's got to be interesting you know obviously   having a little caramel with the marshmallow  goodness on the outside i think my mom's favorite   namesake for the channel which she loves peeps  um is getting upgraded nicely so i'll have to see   uh misty smith what's your favorite chic favorite  sandwich um i would probably say the popeye's   chicken sandwich is one of my favorites although  the chick-fil-a one i do get more often than not   because i know the wifey likes to go to  chick-fil-a and i like chick-fil-a too   um so personally i do i do dig the sandwiches  i've been on a kick with wingstop lately though   because i'm still digging those thighs  i love getting the three thigh combo   with some fries it's a guilty pleasure  for sure so i really really like that   they're very tasty uh lemon pepper by the way  that's what i always get it's really good stuff   uh erna let's see will you ever review hard ciders  on the stream you know what i would consider doing   that i think i might um there's very little like  diciness in terms of some of the alcohol things   uh for these things too so i'd have to kind of  take a look and see what they would require just   in case because of you know certain things picked  up and closed captioning and stuff like that as   well um but the baja mountain dews that's  really that may be the thing that breaks me   to give it a go because it definitely sounds like  it would be good personally personally i think so   lord i think you did mention that you had moved  to florida i think you were in the process   that you had mentioned there i hope it was a good  thing for you and you're safe and sound obviously   um getting used to your new surroundings  missy smith said she loves that too you'll   say chick-fil-a is better and i like the business  model better i try to support good businesses i   hear you i hear you they're very very efficient  with the drive-throughs and very nice people   obviously um they really do a good job for sure  making you feel feel wanted and appreciated erna   i can't wait for the oreo cakesters those are the  best ever never had those but they do look pretty   awesome i mean when you have like cake you know  oreo cake with the cream that can't be bad i mean   that just can't be bad you guys know about susie  q's you probably do i may have mentioned it before   um suzy q's are kind of i think what the essence  of what the oreo cakesters are kind of from   because they're very similar it's like a chocolate  based cake with a cream filling like that so i   know my sister will know what that is they're  really really good susie cues are pretty bomb   what's your favorite pizza uh yes men any pizza  any pizza but i do have a special place for um the   lunch combo at caesars i love getting that every  so often um usually just plain cheese believe it   or not i like plain cheese a pepperoni is fine  but i'm more of a sausage topping type of thing   but i love cheese pizza pizza with mushrooms  fresh mushroom um and sausage is my all-time   favorite that's what the wifey usually we usually  get from a place called domenico's here locally   that's always great stuff as well that's  probably going to be what we're going to be   having for a super bowl sunday i have a feeling  or maybe not you'll have to take a look and see   there will be some wings involved to go with it  though i definitely want to have a really like   i want to wing it out you know this year as well  i'm on to like wings lately randy yes i'm well   aware of the mcdonald's menu hacks they're the  most unoriginal thing ever randy people have been   doing that for so long it's hilarious that they're  finally jumping on and just gonna kind of push it   i'm curious to know what the prices are going to  be for that so yeah we'll have to see that maybe   you may see one or two or three we'll figure out  what to do with those um they look interesting   they're gluttonous for what they are of course  but you know we'll have to see i'm concerned about   the pricing because when you price all those items  individually um you're into like the eight or nine   dollar range plus they're not going to charge that  obviously um they're going to be part of a bundle   pack you know together it doesn't cost that much  to make this food but at the same time it should   be pretty interesting to check out there the land  sea and air of course you know being the big gun   i laughed when i saw that it was kind of  funny um with that too but you know what hey   you know if it works the marketing looks pretty  interesting it looks cool we'll have to see what   happens with it there so um i'll see if i can  get those onto the channel i'm sure you'll see   you'll see a whole multitude of those things  coming out day one um for people uh let's see misty smith on a scale of 1 to 10 i will give it a  10 out of 10. that's cool i like that emoji that's   very cool very nice very nice have you seen it  you're not going to end the stream anytime soon   aria well funny that you mention it because it's  almost up for dinner time for me so um yes we will   be actually stopping in about maybe nine minutes  or so for sure i have got a chicken bowl i believe   waiting for me and i gotta uh thank the wifey for  bringing that back home because she knew i was   going to be doing this tonight so yes i'm going to  be having some chicken and brown rice a little bit   of light teriyaki sauce and some the vinegars had  cabbage to go with it and then i'm getting down   with a little boba fett and then i'll get the  stream ready for this that you'll see tomorrow   um as well and the next review will be coming up  early this coming week um this has just been a   horrendous week guys i'm just gonna just put it  out there for you because it's just been really   really ridiculous just hard on all levels so i'm  just glad to be able to kind of relax a little bit   uh see some family tomorrow that i haven't seen in  a very long time and just really kind of just get   back to you know feeling you know feeling good  about certain things so i'm really just excited   to um see how that's going to go of course as well  so good times uh for sure you got to make time for   yourself you got to keep yourself mentally good  and you got to definitely do what you can to make   yourself as happy as possible and definitely take  care of the peeps around you uh for sure you know   just so you know from uh from me to you from me to

of  actress demi moore i don't have an opinion one way   or another but some pretty great movies over the  years for sure absolutely for sure ed keaton you   have a great weekend as well absolutely and drew  i think i already gave it away i'm catching up   in the chat what is for dinner tonight let's see  have you seen him i actually finally got a chance   to try panera bread's flapper pizza the other  week nice i really enjoyed it myself i thought   it was actually pretty good not bad for what it  is right i had fun reviewing a few of those um   a few months back i had a lot of fun checking  those out not for sure uh randy molina i watch   healthy junk food for hacks in the day and hacks  and sunday's fudge you ask them to add eminence   cheaper than mcclure very cool yeah they have some  great content too there they're definitely jp and   julia have been doing it up there they've been  blowing up for a very long time that's awesome   that's awesome and yes uh ender text not to worry  the uh uh uda noodles the japanese udon noodles   is definitely on the docket so you will see that  uh very very soon not to worry and a few other   things from another local spot here that's doing  a few little testing things here and there as well   uh for sure michael doing there the ice cream  is coming out february 1st they're exclusive to   walmart very nice something to look forward to  i gotta go shopping here we're getting low on a   few things so i gotta make my way over there to  see what's going on and also to see if there's   anything new masters of the universe wise that  may be creeping out before my pre-orders show   up just to see um as well uh let's see drew needs  late night donuts with boba fett that sounds good   little tiger tail action with some boba fett  and uh hanging with my buddy mr jimmy for sure   good times and have you seen it yes i have seen  the new disney series i'm just one episode behind   i got to take a look at this past wednesdays  um i could take it or leave it i got to be   honest there's really not too much story i mean  for it's a little slow here and there and i see   what they're doing with it but it's really kind of  filling in some of the backstory of obviously what   happened to boba fett up until we see him in the  mandalorian essentially to kind of explain a few   things which is cool i don't mind a little filler  to help fill that in there because obviously the   mandalorian will be back next holiday or the  end of this year for season uh the next season   so we'll see um but it's okay i mean it's it's  just all right i'm not really a super fan of that   biker gang with the flashy scooters that are all  different colors they seem a little out of place   um for the time period or just when the movie  takes place it just seems a little out there   for me um but overall it's okay i mean just seeing  the uh relatives of jabba so to speak not to ruin   anything for anybody i'm not gonna go further  than that um but it's entertaining you know   it'll it'll fill the void until we uh you know  come out with the mandalorian for the next season   oh for sure man likes my galaxy background  i'm glad you're digging all of that there   so i'm definitely a fan of it too  there i might change it at some point   uh once i do little channel makeovers here and  there but i do like the um i do like the idea   of us being in the nebula as we're doing our  thing here right now it's definitely fun to do   for sure all right so as we round this out here  guys let me just say thank you so much for all of   your love and

see in the next week or two here  um it should be a lot of fun to check out there   and uh you'll see some of those menu hack items  at some point uh probably the land sea and air   is of course the big gun uh with that so it  should be a lot of fun to kind of see i'm just   like i said have you seen i'm curious about the  price points and see what they're going to do   either way it's going to be less than just  getting these things individually and putting   them together yourself which is what they're still  having you do they're just going to charge you a   bundle price for what they are so it should be  a lot of fun so shout out to each and every one   of you and to all my fellow content creators here  in the chat or who may be watching thank you for   doing what you do keep doing it keep pushing  the agenda forward for the niche for sure the   food review community is strong as ever there's  a lot of amazing peeps in the community a lot   of the old guard a lot of the new guard
