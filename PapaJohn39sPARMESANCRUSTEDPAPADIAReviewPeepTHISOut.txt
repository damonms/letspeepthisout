 hey everyone welcome back to another high quality  foodie feature for you here on the channel where   this time i'm over at papa john's because guess  what there's a new papadia in town well sorta   and i'll definitely explain so let's get into  it guys feast your eyes on the all-new parmesan   crusted papadia and in this case we've got a nice  crusted situation on hand guys this is looking   pretty fantastic so what you're looking at here  is a whole bunch of grated parmesan on the outside   of a standard papadia crust and i got to say guys  it looks nice and toasty and definitely plentiful   for sure and let me just also say the aroma of  parmesan is very strong as it should be here but   take a look on the inside of this one here guys  i opted to do a create your own and in this case   we've got a three cheese blend sausage and banana  peppers and i gotta say not only is the parmesan   aromatic but so are those toppings together guys  this is looking absolutely delicious right now   and for dipping of course i'm going in with  the ever popular garlic dipping sauce it's   what they're known for over here aside from their  pizza so absolutely i'm looking forward to that   so let's not waste any more time on this one this  is the all-new parmesan crusted papadia here at   papa john's let's peep out this flavor alright  so right off the break let me just get this out   of the way right off the top considering  i mentioned at the very beginning of this   review this technically is a new option at papa  john's of course but naturally what it really is   is an add-on to the existing papadia lineup so  think of it as a very nice upgraded enhancement   to what's already out there and if you guys want  to see some of the papadias that i've done in   the past because i've done literally all of them  take a look at the playlist popping up on your   screen here right now but guys i gotta say having  the option for parmesan underneath it is kind of   a no-brainer the pungentness that i'm getting in  the car right now is insane and just to show you   this before we get into it again take a look at  that crusted action right there that is just a   lovely situation indeed as it focuses in they  really have a nice plentiful amount on here and   like i said it's so aromatic so strong and with  my combination right now of sausage three cheese   and banana peppers i wanted to go for  something a little bit of color too   man this is looking lovely indeed let's  give this a shot it's my variation of the   parmesan crusted papadia over here with some  sausage pepper cheese goodness let's do it the crunch right away oh man oh that is  strong very strong parmesan look at that   nice and crispy no shortage of it whatsoever guys   and with my choice of toppings on the inside  here plentiful plentiful plentiful i'm really   digging the sausage flavor it's got almost kind  of a breakfast sausage vibe which i kind of like   and then naturally the peppers that are coming  in there as well too a little bit of crunchy   action plenty of cheese but the parmesan man  that is a beautiful add-on let's keep going in man you hear that crunch that is a banging  situation i'm just going to keep showing this   to you because naturally depending upon your  topping of choice or whichever variant of the   pre-made ones that you decide to go with you're  just upgrading the crust to have the parmesan   you are gonna love this because it is so strong  and toasty on the very bottom here i'd almost   love to try different variations of cheese on the  outside of this one but man guys the crispiness   is on point it's a beautiful presentation and  it is toasted and baked to perfection really   really lovely situation on this one let's go for  a couple more bites you know we're getting into   some garlic sauce coming up hang on parmesan is  so good it's got like a tartness but it's pungent   man you know i had a feeling this was going to be  pretty awesome considering the amount of parmesan   cheese they were actually getting my papadia prepped  with when i was watching them put this together   it was really really a lot of goodness there being  put on display and then naturally with a plentiful   amount of the cheese that they were adding to  this on top of the sausage and then naturally   of course with the banana peppers to finish it  off very simple combination with this one but   guys it works extremely well and considering  how awesome it looked when it was coming out   of the oven directly as well i gotta say i knew  i was really in for it guys i really really dig   the overall presentation with this one and again  the prep really was kind of giving me the idea   this was gonna be pretty delicious in general  strictly because of the outside of this here   like i said depending upon your toppings of choice  it doesn't really matter because what you're gonna   get is a very nice amount of parmesan on the  outside so that crusted goodness is absolutely   banging on this and i'm telling you i can't  see myself getting a papadia without this now   strictly because of all the added extra flavor  that it's bringing to the party right now so i'm   gonna go for one more quick bite on this and then  we're definitely getting into some garlic hang on hmm i love the crunch all right here we go with  some garlic dipping sauce action right here which   is basically a very thick garlic butter spread  goodness all around let's hit it man my car is   lit up with garlic and parmesan goodness right  now this is so much fun to check out here we go   oh my god oh my god wow the strong aromatic  parmesan along with the light saltiness that i'm   getting with that just the overall abundance of  flavor is kicked up dramatically with heavy butter   heavy garlic as well guys this is insane i'm  just going to keep going in with this here   this combination is lethal  right now this is so good   along with that sausage in there too guys this  is just ridiculousness let's keep going in this is literally heaven right now it really is   nothing against the other combinations of the  papadias naturally because i've loved all of them   literally this is a beautiful situation because  i've designed it myself with just the ingredients   that i want on top of the actual garlic dipping  sauce action and the crusty goodness of the   parmesan here guys like i said the combination  works extremely well just delicious is all around   i'm gonna keep showing it to you ridiculously here  because it has done so well with the toastiness of   that crust just delicious stuff all right so let's  go for one more bite with this one of course with   some garlic and then we'll close it up in just a  second over here and i'll give you another shot of   the other half here but guys another lovely  situation over here at papa john's with the   addition of a permanent item now with the parmesan  crust over here for the papadias pretty banging all right so whatever your personal favorites are  over here at papa john's you're definitely gonna   dig it with this new crust guys and actually  with everything i've got on the inside of mine   right now it is accentuated big time with that  parmesan crust action right here i am thoroughly   enjoying this right now it's made extremely well  and like i said the quality speaks for itself this   is definitely a delicious new permanent upgrade  over here at papa john's better ingredients better   pizza better than a sandwich papa john's all  right so just to be fair i'm not going to give   this one a rating strictly because this is a build  your own type of situation i've done right now so   just basing it strictly off the flavor of the  parmesan crust on its own let me just say guys   that is an easy add-on and like i said i can't  see myself getting a papadia without it because   it's so pungent and it adds so much richness to  whatever it is that you get papadia wise anyway   mix that up with the garlic sauce it's a banging  situation so if you go for a different one you're   going to have that much more of a different flavor  profile but guys i'm telling you the buttery   garlic goodness goes amazing with the parmesan  crust and like i said an easy recommendation   every single time i come to papa john's to get  a papadia i'm getting it all right so now the   all-important question after everything you've  seen in my review here right now are you gonna   be getting it drop some comments down below let  me know first and foremost what's
