returning to carl's jr once again in the AM because it looks like a morning menu favorite's getting a nice little upgrade so let's go in on the fan favorite breakfast burger now with a fried egg and as you can see we're greeted with that standard sesame seeded bun and underneath it let's break this one down plenty of ketchup to start with guys they are not skimping on the ketchup game over here we've got two strips of bacon melty american cheese and that's all on top of the main star of the show here that fried egg goodness looking pretty nice there a pretty decent size that's all sitting on top of a charbroiled all-beef patty a definite trademark here at carl's jr and underneath that we've got a bunch of their hash rounds essentially small mini hash brown bites along with more ketchup so guys looking pretty nice i gotta say again that beef is looking pretty awesome with those grill marks let's see if this one's gonna deliver it's the fan favorite breakfast burger now with a fried egg here at carl's jr let's peep out this flavor you know after checking out that prime rib and fried egg biscuit here at carl's jr recently something was telling me i was going to swing on back to give the fan favorite breakfast burger a shot with that fried egg because guys truth be known i've actually reviewed this in the past about three or so years ago take a look at that review popping up on your screen here right now you can take a look at the original version with that folded egg so for me personally this is a nice upgrade because the fried egg makes a serious difference and i have to say this is already looking pretty amazing guys take a look at that pseudo yokey goodness right there in the middle that is definitely a lovely situation along with everything else this has got going with it so very excited to give this one another go but before i do one like always if you guys are fans of high quality delicious looking food reviews make sure to hit that subscribe button down below and don't forget to tap that bell icon so you can be notified as soon as brand new content drops every week guys the breakfast burger once again but with a nice upgrade with the fried egg let's give it a shot mmm already that fried egg has got a light butteriness on top of it when you combine that instantly with all the ketchup that i got in that first bite and those crispy hash rounds on the bottom that's not even getting into the actual burger just yet very flavorful and with the hickory smoked bacon coming up on that back end i love the situation let's go for another bite it's pretty good man well if you like ketchup on your breakfast items you are in for a treat with this one because it is layered from top to bottom and it's really coming through very strong it's very very sweet but when you combine that with all the other goodness on this one guys a lovely situation not really tasting the cheese too much but the overall flavor is beginning to come through on that burger as well as the bacon together so everything else is really working with this and i gotta say again that fried egg is awesome yeah the fried egg makes such a difference on this guys let me take a piece off to show you here that is just a lovely situation and i like the fact that it's got a little bit of the yokey goodness on the inside but it really does add overall because it's a light buttery flavor on top of it and it's noticeably different from the folded egg from the last time that i did this about three years ago makes a huge difference mmm it's really good but not tasting the cheese at all that's really the only thing with this because of how strong the ketchup is and everything else on it let's keep going yeah there's a reason this is one of the most popular breakfast items on the menu here at carl's jr guys everything works amazingly well with this and even though i'm not a super fan of ketchup on my breakfast items everything works so well that ketchup is adding a little bit of extra flavor on top of the light butteriness like i said i'm getting from the fried egg the hickory smoked bacon the beefiness of the beef and then you're getting the saltiness coming from those hash rounds on the bottom guys overall it's just a very hearty breakfast sandwich and again with the signature charbroiled beef over here carl's jr again really digging those grill marks on the very bottom guys you can really taste the quality of this one really really tasty so let's go for one more bite we'll close this one out after the rating but guys if you have a carl's jr in the area get the fried egg on pretty much anything you can because it really adds overall flavor to everything that it's on so far and aside from the prime rib and fried egg biscuit it works amazingly well on the breakfast burger so glad to give this one a shot right now one more bite all right so let's do a 360 on this one guys like i said that fried egg makes a huge difference on this one and the fact that they're giving you a nice size version of it is a lovely situation it pretty much covers the whole sandwich here and you're getting it in every single bite lots of lunch goodness thrown into this one if you're a brunch person like I am you have that beef patty in there it really makes a real difference overall and with those hash rounds in there really a lovely situation on top of the bacon as well guys just really really tasty so with that said i'm gonna have to give the breakfast burger with the fried egg over here at carl's jr a rock solid 9.5 out of 10. it's really a nice step up from the original breakfast burger guys and that's saying something because that was pretty awesome in and of itself and while i wish the cheese stood out just a little bit i mean i see why i couldn't really considering the flavor of the ketchup being so pronounced on this one there's a lot of ketchup on here everything else really really worked on that and now that i think about it they probably should have upgraded even the cheese on this i mean adding the cheddar cheese sauce from that prime rib burger would have been a pretty lovely situation but hey maybe for the next version because for right now that fried egg really does elevate this one to a different flavor profile that really is distinct above the original breakfast burger so pretty solid all right so now the obvious question if you've got a carl's jr in the area are you going to be giving this one a shot drop some comments down below first and foremost have you ever had the breakfast burger to begin with and if you have how excited are you to give this one a shot with a fried egg on top drop those comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K closing out another high quality
