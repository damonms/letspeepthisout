what  guys the strawberry frosty is finally out for the   summer and i mean come on how could i not review  this right i mean i'm always telling you guys to   stay frosty and now i'm going to be doing just  that with hopefully a very tasty version of it   guys feast your eyes on it it's the strawberry  frosty over here at wendy's as i try to keep it   together for you let's break this one on down  real quick all right so very simply what we've   got here is a classic vanilla frosty blended with  strawberry flavored syrup and while you can kind   of see it's a little on the red side it's more of  a tint than anything else but guys it still looks   very refreshing and very inviting and it's also  very much melting right now as well so let's get   into this quickly guys let me lift some of this  up for you oh wow you can see it there that tint   is nice more vanilla than anything else but in  terms of the color but it does have that tint of   red let's give it a shot guys the strawberry  frosty over here at wendy's let's peep this out ooo it's more vanilla rich   with a light hint of strawberry at the  very end but very smooth very creamy wow wow wow wow guys let me get this focused  for you trying to anyway look at this   that is a beautiful situation hopefully that  color is kind of coming through here but it is   really smooth very rich  mmm not overly sweet at all   this is definitely nice i probably should have  got some cookies or something to go into this with   but man let's keep going for it here look  at this guys very luscious very decadent   a very lovely situation indeed you knew it was  gonna be right very tasty let's keep going in wow that is super refreshing i'm gonna keep  showing it to you because it is definitely   heavenly right now and i'm very glad  to be staying frosty with a frosty   with this new flavor very nice on this guys you  have the choice between this one and chocolate for   summer and i guess the vanilla one's coming back  in september just in time for my birthday but this   is going to be nice to go in on throughout  the summer lightly sweetened it's not bad   with a beautiful rich vanilla type of flavor  initially but then that nice little combo at the   very end of the smooth richness of that strawberry  guys it's light but very nice very satisfying another couple on this this is really good  and i'm gonna keep showing you the money shots   because there's really not too much else i  can show you with this one here because it's   melting but it's still holding its own just  look at that guys beautiful stuff all around wow a banging situation on this   one more time very very nice indeed guys very nice  indeed just look at that action beautifulness on   your screen right now in hd really really nice i  really love the color on this just the light red   that it's got a beautiful situation one more  and then we'll close the review out with the   rating coming up next but guys it's going to get  rated high how could it not very delicious stuff all right i lied one more money shot on this one  guys it's too good not to show you and again i'm   really digging the fact that it's not overly  sweet it's very refreshing and guys it's here   all throughout the summer a beautiful situation  and something you should definitely check out   very delicious on this yeah that is definitely a  banging situation when it comes to frosty's for   sure guys and like i said it's not overly sweet  so i'm really digging that so you get the nice   flavor of the classic frosty with a little  bit of the strawberry action at the very end   and guys they complement each other beautifully  with a very light strawberry like hue in terms   of the color just a light tinge of red but it's  just a beautiful situation across the board in   terms of the appearance and the flavor it really  delivers with that all right so with all that said   i'm gonna have to give the strawberry frosty  here at wendy's the obvious 10 out of 10 guys   there's really nothing wrong with this whatsoever  it's very tasty and overall a very very solid   presentation in terms of the color it definitely  looks a little bit different than the regular   classic frosty and that's a good thing because  it's strawberry you want that but at the same time   it's just very light in terms of that flavor  at the very end with the main vanilla frosty   coming up on the front end and i really like that  guys because it really works very well delicious   stuff and again definitely worth checking out all  right so do me a quick favor the obvious question   are you going to be giving this one a shot drop  some comments down below let me know if you are   going to check this one out and actually what  size did you get the small the medium or the   large because this is the small and believe it  or not that's more than enough for me but do   me a quick favor drop those comments down below  and definitely let me
