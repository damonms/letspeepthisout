 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty hey everyone welcome back to another high quality  foodie feature for you here on the channel where   this time i'm back on over at panera bread to  hit up another variation of their all all-new   flatbread pizzas and this one's looking to go  just a little bit more classical so to speak   guys feast your eyes on the pepperoni  flatbread pizza and what we've got here   is a very lovely situation of ingredients  i gotta say this is looking pretty great   starting off with the obvious we've got fresh  mozzarella a very solid amount of oversized   pepperoni as well as tomato bell pepper sauce  and that's all on top of a signature crust   before it's baked up into the goodness that  you see right in front of you here right now   and again a very lovely presentation this really  looks and smells fantastic six nice pieces this is   cut into let's just get into this real fast guys  i am already digging the aroma in my car right now   and this is a little on the hot side so  let me try and lift up a piece of this   quickly here yeah this is kind of toasty right  now feast your eyes again on that guys very lovely   situation with that fresh mozzarella and i am  really digging the size of the pepperonis on this   let's give this a shot it's the all-new pepperoni  flatbread pizza here at panera bread let's do it oh yeah high quality mozzarella you can taste it   it's got a nice mild saltiness as well  as the denseness that it's got as well   too so when you bite into it you can really  kind of feel like it's pulling away from you   and the crust itself admittedly although it's  not nearly as toasty as i'd like it i think i   had this problem the last time out as well it  really is pretty nice considering what it is the   sauce itself is about average it's okay but the  pepperonis have a nice amount of spice here let me   get that focused in for you take a look at those  pepperonis guys i'm really loving how they're   kind of curling up a little bit and i gotta say  wow that cheese is really flavorful that's the   highlight of this believe it or not on top of the  pepperoni as it should be right let's keep going yes that is really nice those crispy edges  are pretty amazing here let me lift up another   slice just to show you a little bit more in depth  because the other one looks like it's almost gone   already there it's not really very big on these  slices but as you can see a very lovely situation   on those pepperonis and again the crispness  is really going so beautifully with the cheese   the fresh mozzarella as well naturally with that  sauce the tomato bell pepper sauce that's in there   it's a signature over here at panera it's pretty  unique to them and again the toastiness on the   very bottom i wish this was just a little bit more  as you can see it looks a little undercooked even   though it does have some crispiness to it it could  be just a little bit more crisper in my opinion   but i am definitely digging the quality of what we  got here right now so let's keep going in guys i'm   really liking it considering pepperoni is not one  of my all-time favorites this is still pretty good   not bad and you know what being that we now  have some classic pepperoni pizza on the menu   over here panera i'm still holding out hope  there's going to be a sausage variant because   i would love to see that considering sausage  is one of my all-time favorite pizza toppings   and considering how well that margherita pizza  turned out which i reviewed not that long ago   i'm sure you're seeing that review popping up  on your screen here right now definitely check   that one out this is a pretty lovely addition to  the menu and considering it's classic pepperoni   how could you not have an option like that  on the menu initially from the get-go right   so it's great to see this one available  even though i think this probably should   have been around the first time out when they  introduced these flatbread pizzas but even still   it's here now and it goes pretty amazing with that  fresh mozzarella pretty awesome let's keep going again though i know it's not traditional pizza  but i really do wish that the crust itself was   just a little bit crunchier considering what i've  got here right now it's okay it's passable you   can definitely hear the crunch and feel it it  just feels a little undercooked just a little   bit but considering it's flat bread it's pretty  much right in between like a regular pizza slice   as well as flatbread pizza right in the middle  the thickness is kind of reminding me of that   like it's trying to be right in between flatbread  and standard pizza so it's decent for what it is   but like i said guys the mozzarella is the main  selling point with this on top of the pepperoni   but as tasty as those two main ingredients  are believe me they are this is very flavorful   right now the cost is just a little up there  considering this is close to ten dollars here   in southern california you can literally go to  like a dedicated pizza spot and get a large pizza   with a lot more on it for roughly the same price  point so i think it's priced just a little bit   too high here in southern cali at least with  something like this maybe like $6.99 $7.99 tops   but at the same time the quality of the mozzarella  and that pepperoni is pretty bomb on this let's go   for one more bite we'll close this one out after  the rating but guys very tasty i'm super glad to   have checked this one out right now let's do it  you know another cool thing about this pepperoni   flatbread pizza here at panera is the fact that  it's not very greasy and that's one of the main   gripes i have with pepperoni in general and  it's also one of the reasons i'm not really   a super fan of it but even still the flavor is  amazing on this and like i said that mozzarella   is the real selling point for this on top of  the pepperoni itself just a nice combination   but again i sure wish that crust on the bottom  was just a little bit toastier but that's it   well now that i think about it maybe the price  being a few dollars cheaper wouldn't be a bad   idea either considering everything you've seen  and heard me talk about in this review i think that   point has driven home pretty well this one even  though it's delivering in the flavor department   pretty nicely the price is just very much up there  guys close to ten dollars for something like that   it's hard to be competitive in the pizza game  considering what this is but even still nice   quality all around so with that said i'm gonna  have to give the all-new pepperoni flatbread   pizza here at panera bread just an okay 7 out of  10 it really loses a bunch of points because of   the price point but even still the quality is  nice on that i'm not going to beat it to death   anymore further with the crust on the bottom not  being as cooked but even still it is pretty crisp   and the quality of those ingredients are solid but  like i said the price point just a little up there   okay now i've just got one simple very important  question for you does this look like it was worth   $9.79 to you drop those comments down below and  definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K   closing out another high quality foodie feature  for you here on peep this out reviews bringing   you brand new content every single week here on my  channel so while you stay tuned for that next review  coming real soon in the meantime stay frosty  i'm definitely down with the quality of this   one absolutely i'm just not down with the price  point come on panera you could easily fix that   alright guys until next time i'll talk to
