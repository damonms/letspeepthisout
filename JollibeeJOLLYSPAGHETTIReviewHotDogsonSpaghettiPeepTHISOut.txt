 all right so you can't really review jollibee  without going in one of their main signature   items outside of their famous chicken  so the question is am i truly going to   be jolly about their jolly spaghetti well  stay tuned because we're about to find out   welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty all right welcome or welcome back to the  channel guys it's Ian K and today i've got   the jolly spaghetti for you feast your eyes  on this this is a pretty healthy portion of   spaghetti topped off with the good stuff and  i have to admit i am getting a really really   nice feeling with the aroma in my car right now  lots of heavy tomato sauce vibes with this one   all right so what we've got here is that sizable  portion of spaghetti topped off with their   signature sweet style sauce along with chunks of  ham ground beef and hot dog and it looks like a   little bit of cheese on the top for garnish and  definitely for color of course it's going to add a   little bit of that but guys a very hefty situation  and considering how much is in this bowl right now   i'm definitely digging the presentation of it  and on the real let's just say i'm also digging   the fact that there is cheese on this guys so it  really kind of breaks up the monotony of just the   tomato sauce and the meat products that are in  this but even still a very hefty portion of my   hand here right now so let me see if i can get  a little bit of everything here i'll give this   a go hopefully that's staying focused for you  there we go a little bit of the cheese action   it looks like a little bit of ham there as well  let's give this a shot for the first time ever   here on the channel it's the jolly spaghetti  let's see if i'm jolly about it here we go wow it's actually very sweet but rich and hearty  on this and i love the fact that the pasta itself   is al dente so it's got some slight  chew to it which i'm really digging   but it's all the meats that this one  has that really kind of sets itself   apart and the fact that it's fast food  spaghetti on top of it you don't see stuff   like this all the time guys let's give  this a shot again let's keep going in on it hot dog wow very hearty very rich on that sauce  i'm really liking this so far so we're gonna   keep going in let me twirl a little action  here we'll give you another close-up of this   really really different i have to say  my first time having something like this   i mean i'm kind of used to spaghetti sandwiches  and making different concoctions using pasta   but this is kind of different like i said with  the combination of the meats that are in this   i have to admit i'm really liking this but the  sauce is a little on the sweet side i'm going to   keep showing as much of this as i can for you  but as you can see it photographs beautifully   in hd and i have to admit very nice in terms  of that portion size again let's keep going in not bad yeah definitely a hearty situation  with this one i haven't really gotten into   any ground beef just yet but the ham and the  hot dog definitely flavorful they really stand   out when you mix them together especially  but it's like combination of that sweet   sauce that this one has here their signature  sweet style sauce that they're calling it   that's really taking this one down believe it or  not just a little bit because it's overly sweet   but at the same time a very healthy portion  of goodness here and again the presentation   not bad you know now that i'm looking at this it  looks like the ground beef is kind of minced in   with the sauce itself so it's kind of there  but i'm not really tasting anything above and   beyond the sweetness and that tomato sauce and  naturally once you get the ham little hot dog   action let me lift a little bit of this up to  show you actually take a look at that guys not   bad they're small little bite-sized pieces of hot  dog but i'm really digging the fact that it goes   very nicely with the sauce even still on the sweet  side let's keep going in for a couple more on this yeah i can see why they really kind of promote  this one on top of their regular chicken guys   i mean this really does stand out as being  something definitely different at least for   fast food you don't really see fast food  spaghetti really anywhere personally but   having it from obviously jollibee it's one of  their signatures on the menu and i definitely   wanted to give it a go give another shot of  this here more of the glamour shots for you   basically lots of that sweet style sauce the  tomato sauce goodness it's very aromatic you   can notice it right when you pick up the  tray on this one when you lift the lid   but still everything else is looking pretty  nice on this so definitely digging it it's not   bad a little on the sweet side still i know  i've said that ad nauseam up to this point   but still i'm glad to have given this one a shot  let's close this one up with a review coming up   next after this next bite and of course i'm  going to give you another close-up hang on so $4.99 for this not a bad deal considering the  size of it of course and it definitely presents   very well $6.49 with a drink and obviously  i think that's going to be the way to go   for a little combo action but at the same time  what you're getting here is fast food spaghetti   with a little bit of a jollibee twist and again  the addition of those chunks of ham the minced   ground beef all throughout the sauce and those  chopped hot dogs really does add to make this one   completely different and very unexpected in the  flavor department not too bad on this one at all   all right so with that said i'm gonna have to give  the jolly spaghetti over here at jollibee a pretty   decent 7 out of 10 this is definitely not my  go-to over here at jollibee with everything i've   tried so far and you can definitely take a look  at the playlist popping up on your screen right   now for proof of all the other goodies they've  got but at the same time this really is something   different and again fast food spaghetti you really  don't see that too often definitely digging the   addition of those meats on that but like i said  the ground beef is kind of minced into the sauce   but with those chunks of ham the hot dog naturally  it's very very different even though the elevated   sweet level is taking it down just a notch but  still not bad for $4.99 and again the portion   size pretty decent all right so for all you jolly  heads out there who definitely dig the food over   here at jollibee what did you personally think of  this one drop some comments down below is this one   of your go-to's when you're on the menu over here  at jollibee and actually for those of you who've   never been to jollibee is this going to entice  you to give it a shot outside of their chicken   drop some comments down below and definitely  let me know and with that this is Ian K   closing out another high quality foodie feature  for you here on peep this out reviews bringing   you brand new content every single week here on  my channel so while you stay tuned for that next review  coming real soon in the meantime stay frosty  well i guess i was a little jolly for the jolly   spaghetti over here at jollibee but on the real  it's all about the chicken and i think you know   that that is absolutely the creme de la creme  on their menu but this is a nice diversion if   you want to try something different because  it is pretty different all right guys until   next time i'll talk to you soon hey thanks for  checking out another one of my reviews but just   in case you didn't see the one before this one  you can find it right
