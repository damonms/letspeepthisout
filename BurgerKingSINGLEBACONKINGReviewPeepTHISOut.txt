 what's going on everyone and welcome back to  another high quality foodie feature for you   here in the channel where this time i'm over at bk  to take a look at another version of an all-time   classic that's going to be part of a couple  of promos for a limited time only this summer   and you already know what it is feast your eyes  on the single bacon king an all-time classic just   in a smaller form guys definitely digging the  presentation of this one with plenty of bacon   falling out the sides as you can see this is  looking pretty cool so let's pop the top of that   sesame seeded bun and take a look underneath and  what you're going to find is the usual combination   of ketchup and mayo and as we pan down you're  going to notice three large strips of bacon   crisscrossed very nicely guys nice presentation  there it's covering all angles of it here what   we've also got is the usual two slices of american  cheese and that's all sitting on in this case   one quarter pound flame grilled beef patty  guys and as you can see a very wide whopper   patty that it is with a little mixture of that  salt and pepper seasoning sprinkle to go with   and it still looks pretty substantial in the  size department considering this is just a single   version of that classic double but underneath it  it looks like we've got nothing there but as you   can see guys all the usual suspects here minus a  patty of beef but still a very lovely presentation   so let's not waste any more time on this one  this is the new single bacon king over here at bk   let's peep out this flavor well i don't know about  you guys but i guess the question that i have for   this is it's still considered a bacon king if  it's missing that second patty because naturally   all the king burgers with the king name have the  double patties with this one but considering the   name of it bacon king this definitely has a very  decent amount of bacon to speak of here guys and   it's looking fairly crispy as you can see not  a bad presentation and still like i said very   sizable in the width department i mean it's the  whopper patty you can see how big this is in my   hand still pretty sizable all right so let's see  if this one's gonna be just as satisfying in the   flavor department even though that second patty is  missing and maybe a little extra bacon is missing   as well here we go guys it's the single  bacon king new over here at bk let's do it yup well it's just like you'd expect it to  be it's a bacon king on a smaller scale and   honestly guys i kind of prefer this this is  actually kind of nice for a change although   i think the name they're using for marketing  for obvious reasons this really just feels   like a large bacon cheeseburger single patty  but it's a whopper patty so as you guys know   the thickness is definitely there anyway  because you've got that quarter pound of   flame grilled goodness right there and of  course you've got the mixture of mayo and   ketchup which is not a bad combination the bacon  is fairly crispy the two slices of cheese as usual   and again the size is pretty wide on this so what  it doesn't really have in height it actually has   in the width and i'm actually digging that guys  because it does feel substantial and as mentioned   it's kind of cool it's going to be part of these  two promo meals coming out for the summertime   you've got the two for ten meal deal as well  as a buy one get one for a dollar so not too   bad considering you're losing a patty but you're  getting another full sandwich on each of them but   at the same time guys it's still nice to see a  different variation of a classic and guys this   really is a classic so much so that it actually  became permanent after i reviewed it the first   time back in 2016 and if you take a look at that  review popping up on your screen here right now   that was a halloween video loaded with lots of fun  effects when i put that one together so i haven't   actually had the bacon king really since then even  though there's been so many variations of the king   burgers that have bacon and cheese naturally  and ketchup and all that usual good stuff you're   probably seeing the playlist also jumping up  on your screen here right now there is a lot   of content for bk for you in that but guys like i  said this is pretty tasty let's keep going on in well i'm okay with them keeping the bacon king  name with this because even though there's a   little bit less bacon on this he's usually about  six pieces i believe on the regular one you've   got three here it's not really an overloaded bacon  double cheeseburger but honestly guys as a single   variant this works pretty nicely and again like i  said the width of it is a lot of food here still   guys even still the thickness being what it is  it's the classic bk flavors with the seasoning   the same type of flame grilled taste but just on  a smaller scale compared to the regular bacon king   and again like i said even though i'm missing  just a few extra pieces of bacon i don't mind   it at all because like i said with the width of  this burger being what it is these strips cover   it pretty nicely in the crisscross pattern you're  pretty much almost guaranteed a little bit of   bacon in every bite with the exception of the top  size over there as you can see there's some space   but even still guys the ketchup the mayo all that  good stuff it's really the classic stuff on a   smaller scale so let me put this one back together  we'll go for one more bite we'll close it up after   the rating but i gotta say guys again not bad and  i'm glad i'm revisiting this in the original form   with the original name minus a beef patty still  pretty fun though let's go for one more bite all right so let's go around the world with  this one guys and as you can see one last time   lots of flop here when it comes to the bacon  they really have large slices cut onto this   and i'm really digging that so the bacon king  name is that for sure because of all the bacon   even though it's missing a patty i am definitely  digging the combination of the goodness here it's   the same familiarity from bk but just on a smaller  scale but a bigger scale technically because of   the width of the burger itself well that's a  pretty tasty alternative to the standard bacon   king if you're not that hungry guys and like i  said the main showpiece of it is naturally being   part of those two promos which should be going  live i believe right after fourth of july so if   you're watching this around that time you know  what to expect guys pretty solid stuff so with   that said i'm gonna have to give the quote-unquote  all-new single bacon king over here at bk a pretty   solid 8 out of 10 like i said it's very  reminiscent of what you already know over here   from bk but just on a smaller form so think of it  as an oversized bacon cheeseburger for a little   less cost and like i said it's not a bad deal if  it's part of those two new promos pretty tasty   all right question time if you've made it this  far into the review i'd venture to guess you're   probably a fan of the bacon king already and if  you are how excited are you to try the single   patty version of it i mean do you personally  still consider it a bacon king without the   second layer of beef drop those comments  down below and definitely let me know and   with that this is Ian K closing out another  high quality foodie feature for you here on   peep the sound reviews bringing you brand new  content every single week here on my channel   so while you stay tuned for that next review coming  real soon in the meantime stay frosty and yes just   in case you're wondering i bought a
