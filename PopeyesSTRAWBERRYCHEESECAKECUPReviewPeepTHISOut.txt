 what's going on everyone welcome back to another  high quality foodie feature for you here on the   channel where this time i'm over at popeyes to  check out their latest sweet treat for summer   that just so happens to not be some type of fried  pie but even still it's looking pretty handheld   that's right and as you obviously know it's their  all-new strawberry cheesecake cup in a very nice   portion controlled container guys i'm definitely  digging the presentation of this one here it looks   pretty nice so what we've got here very simply  is a nice small portion of smooth cheesecake   that actually has strawberry puree of some type  mixed into it along with a graham cracker crust   on the very bottom and guys again portion control  is definitely on point with this one here looking   pretty decent for the presentation of it and one  other thing to note with this one here it appears   to be an officially branded item on popeyes  here usually you don't see these stickers in   the very bottom but there you go guys it's the  official popeyes strawberry cheesecake cup with   all of the ingredients that i'll let you pause the  video for to check out if you'd like to see that   but even still like i said presentation looks  pretty cool and for $2.50 maybe a little on the   small side but even still if you're a cheesecake  fan you have a lot to look forward to right   all right so like i've said plenty of times in  the past cheesecake is not necessarily my ideal   dessert i mean naturally there are plenty of  people out there who love cheesecake i'm not   necessarily one of them but i can appreciate  it it's not bad at the same time i'm more   interested on the type of strawberry that's in  this to see if it's kind of all throughout and   guys graham cracker crust how could you not want  to go in on that right so let me actually grab   a little piece here i'll try and go all the  way to the bottom to give you a nice look at   everything and i think i actually got it there  we go not too bad this is actually feeling   very very thick already here as it begins to focus  in you can kind of see in the very bottom the pie   crust goodness we've got a nice little block of  that cheesecake action and some of the strawberry   preserves let's give us a shot it's the all-new  strawberry cheesecake cup here popeyes let's do it thick very thick that's not bad yeah pretty  nice on this one so far and definitely smooth   very rich very thick on the cheesecake itself here  guys let me grab another little piece of it here   it is very very dense and i guess this  cheesecake should be right take a look   at that it is definitely a sizable portion of  goodness on the inside and even though the cup   is portion controlled i got to say guys even after  a couple of bites of this i think you're going to   be good i think i'm going to be considering  how rich and dense it is let's keep going in wow this is pretty quality it really is not only  is the cheesecake itself very dense it's very   smooth and very rich so i'm kind of glad that  we're having a portion controlled piece of this   here guys right now because i can only imagine  how many calories this is but even still as you   can see that strawberry puree is mostly down to  the middle right over there and there's just a   light coating of the graham cracker crust on the  bottom of it here as well but even still guys very   rich flavor of cheesecake on this one with nice  little accents of that strawberry goodness on   the back end pretty nice i guess considering the  size of this i was expecting maybe just a little   bit more crust on the very bottom because i'm a  huge fan of pie crust in general especially the   kind of like crumbly graham cracker style that's  one of my favorites here but even still what we've   got is a very nice combination of goodness and  like i said if you guys are fans of cheesecake   you already know you're making it this far into  the review you want to give this one a shot   i'd recommend that you do $2.50 is not a bad price  for the quality here even though the size is small   but at the same time i am absolutely  digging this here let's go for one more   bite and then we'll close it up after the  rating guys pretty good stuff pretty good so yeah not too much else to say about this  one aside from the fact that the sweetness   is definitely even across the board  i'm really digging the quality of the   strawberry puree with this and honestly with  the quality of the cheesecake to go with it   it pairs up very nicely my only gripe is  at the very bottom there is not too much   crust to go around but i guess it's more of  the accent to the overall star of the show   which is the strawberry cheesecake itself  but still very flavorful across the board so with that said i'm going to have to give the  all-new strawberry cheesecake cup here at popeyes   a pretty solid 7.5 out of 10 i'm  not going to go much higher than that because   naturally i wanted to see a little bit more of the  graham cracker crust on the bottom but even still   that strawberry puree was pretty nice and the  quality of the cheesecake for especially those   of you guys who love cheesecake you have a lot  to look forward to with that pretty nice even   a $2.50 maybe just a little bit more expensive  than it needs to be i remember a similar cup   like that was like $1.99 not that long ago  but it's cheesecake it's a premium i get it   all right so now aside from me asking you if  you're going to be giving this one a shot do me   a quick favor drop some comments down below let me  know what your favorite variation of cheesecake is   if it's not just the regular plain cheesecake or  maybe the strawberry variant that i'm having right   now let me know with your favorite fruit topping  or if there's something else in it that you like   and also do you think $2.50 is too much to ask for  the size of this particular one here at popeyes   drop some comments down below and definitely let  me know and with that this is Ian K closing out   another high quality foodie feature for you here  on peep this out
