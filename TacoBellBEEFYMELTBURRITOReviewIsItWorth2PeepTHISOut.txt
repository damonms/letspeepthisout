 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty what's going on everyone and welcome back to  another high quality foodie feature for you   here on the channel where this time i'm over at  taco bell to check out one of their quote unquote   new cravings value menu items now available for  a limited time only and i'm only saying quote   unquote new because i have a feeling you've seen  something like this before over here so without   further ado let's get into it guys feast your eyes  on the beefy melt burrito not a bad situation here   but it looks like we've got plenty of rice to go  around for sure all right so very simply what this   consists of is their standard flour tortilla  nice and warm filled with seasoned beef nacho   cheese sauce seasoned rice reduced fat sour cream  a three cheese blend and it looks like some red   strips thrown in for good measure guys but again  very familiar all those classic ingredients from   taco bell wrapped up good to go and for two bucks  not a bad value i'm thinking but on the real i'm   a little concerned by how much beef is actually  in what i'm looking at here right now because   it looks like it's more of a rice show than  anything else but still definitely digging the   color variation with the red strips let me just  see if i can confirm the goodness and hopefully   there's some seasoned beef in here considering  what this is supposed to have right here we go   guys it's the all-new beefy melt burrito for  two bucks over here at taco bell let's do it okay it's in there i guess it was more front  loaded with the rice right there because i got   actually a nice bite of beef with that but as you  guys can see all the comfort food goodies from   taco bell made just a little bit better because  it's actually during the rain that i'm filming   this right now i'm really digging the fact that  this is storming outside of my car nice and warm   and as you guys can see plenty of rice and all  the other goodies mixed together classic taco bell   for a two dollar value and the size is not bad  on this one oh and did i mention this is pretty   much familiar i had a feeling what this was gonna  be like before i even got into it because guys if   you've had one beef burrito over here at taco  bell you've pretty much had them all with the   addition of the reduced fat sour cream and all  the nacho cheese sauce goodies in this of course   it's those classic timeless flavors let's just  keep going in guys not bad though not bad at all there we go we've got every ingredient  on display for you there plenty of that   seasoned beef goodness mixed throughout along  with the nacho cheese sauce the seasoned rice   the three cheese blend and the reduced fat  sour cream all wrapped up in a nice warm flour   tortilla like i said classic timeless flavors  and again not bad for two bucks but you know   as good as this tastes right now i think the  other two that they have on the menu are going   to be a little bit more interesting so watch  for those to come soon but as it stands guys   very tasty on this one because it's those  familiar flavors like i said that you're used to   and like i said it's accentuated even more because  of how much rain is hitting my car here right now   this is just fun to eat because it's nice and  warm and it's familiar that seems to be the theme   with taco bell lately so let's go for one more  bite on this one because honestly guys there's   really not too much else to say about this one  it's all those classic flavors from taco bell   but i do have to say the addition of the red  strips to this for some color variation is not   battle though they're getting just a little soggy  but you're still getting the extra carbines on top   of everything else still the familiar flavors  like i said add nauseam throughout this review   and for two bucks not a bad deal let's go for  one more bite we'll close this one out hang on yeah there's something about that reduced fat  sour cream along with the nacho cheese sauce   that dovetails so nicely in with the seasoned beef  and then all the other goodies in here guys again   very cool for two bucks the size is not bad on it  and overall you're gonna get exactly what you're   expecting with this one classic taco bell flavor  on the value menu item aka the cravings goodness   not bad guys not bad at all order ahead and  pick yours up at our contactless drive-thru   so with that said i'm gonna have to give  the quote-unquote new beefy melt burrito   here at taco bell off of their cravings value  menu a pretty decent 7 out of 10 and i'm   not gonna go much higher than that because guys  like i said total familiarity that you'd expect   from taco bell they seem to be closing out  the year with all the usual goodies nothing   really crazy with that one but still the value is  decent for two bucks i definitely like the size   it feels very good in the hand obviously it's nice  and warm and it sure has enough ingredients on the   inside along with the size to justify a pretty  decent price point at two bucks definitely give   this one a shot if you haven't already and  speaking of giving it a shot do me a quick   favor as always drop some comments down below  let me know what you thought of this one when   you got it and was it worth the two dollars to you  drop those comments down below and definitely let   me know and with that this is Ian K closing out  another high quality foodie feature for you here   on peep this out reviews bringing you brand new  content every single week here on my channel so   while you stay tuned for that next review coming real soon  in the meantime stay frosty you know i would say   this is pretty much two dollars well spent because  if you're a fan of taco bell you know what to   expect so getting all of their famous ingredients  wrapped up good to go it's always a good thing   alright everyone until next time i'll talk to you  soon hey thanks for checking out another one of   my reviews but just in case you didn't see the one  before this one you can find it right up over here   along what i think youtube's
