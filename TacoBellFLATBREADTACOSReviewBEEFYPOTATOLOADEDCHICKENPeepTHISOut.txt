 what's going on everyone and welcome back to  another high quality foodie feature for you   here on the channel where this time i'm over  at taco bell to take a look at a couple of new   additions they're adding to their cravings value  menu and while it doesn't look like they're   reinventing the wheel with this one there's  one aspect of it that's definitely different   that's right you already know what it is feast  your eyes on their all new flatbread tacos and   as you can see guys the major new addition to this  one is just that flatbread housing all that taco   bell goodness on the inside it's looking pretty  nice and i'm definitely digging the toasted edges   around these two so starting us off is the beefy  potato flatbread taco and on the inside of this   lightly toasted flatbread we've got a decent  portion of seasoned beef nacho cheese sauce   and seasoned potatoes and the overall portion  size for each looks fairly decent from end to   end guys and the aroma is definitely taco bell  in my car right now thanks to this one lots of   seasoned beef aroma going on here for sure and  as we head over to the loaded chicken flatbread   taco what we've got on the inside of this one is  chopped chicken pieces along with lettuce tomato   avocado ranch sauce and a three cheese blend and  i gotta say guys this is looking more filled out   than the other for sure only because it's got more  ingredients but even still lots of greenery here   and it really looks pretty solid so there you go  it's the all new flatbread tacos for just a buck   each over here at taco bell let's peep out this  flavor yesir definitely not reinventing the   will with this one but i'm always down to roll  with it guys because all the taco bell goodness   here no matter what it's wrapped in is usually  pretty tasty and as you can see these are looking   pretty cool so let's start off with that beefy  potato taco because i want to get into that one   it's the most aromatic out of the two naturally  a lot of seasoned beef goodness with this one and   again i am really digging the quantity of the  goodness can't wait to get into this flatbread   action right now here we go it's the one dollar  beefy potato flatbread taco here at taco bell mmm soft well right off the break it's the classic taco  bell flavors as i knew it was gonna be but the   salt is definitely up on this one because of  the beef naturally and of course the cheese   mixture as well but guys lovely situation the  seasoned potatoes are adding to that as well too   decent amount of that beefy action let me try  and open this just a bit for you so you can kind   of see more on the inside not too bad in terms of  what you got here guys this is really really nice   the amount of potatoes are pretty  nice as well let's keep going in mmm it's thick though for a buck it's not bad   let me give you a shot of the back of this  one here because those seasoned potatoes are   a major highlight they go amazing with that nacho  cheese sauce as you'd expect it too but when you   add that seasoned beef in with it and the nice  softness of the flatbread itself i gotta say   guys it's got a very nice chalupa-like feel to it  because naturally it's flat bread very similar to   that but on a thinner scale so it's a little  bit more dusted there's more flour in my hands   but i'm really digging the fact that all those  flavors are really standing out along with it and   hey for a buck you really can't hate on it because  it really feels pretty hearty as you bite into   this naturally you're getting a lot of that potato  flavor naturally with the seasoned beef and the   nacho cheese sauce and overall it's taco bell you  already know what those flavors are but in a nice   softer form because of that flat bread and again  i'm really digging the fact that it's got like   a flowery dusting on the outside of it it feels  noticeably different than a soft taco naturally   but guys definitely a little bit more upscale  and again just a buck all right so let's go   for one more bite of this one then we'll get into  that loaded chicken taco guys pretty solid though yeah my fingers are lit up with the dusty  goodness with this one guys but that's what   makes the experience so much different compared to  eating a soft taco with whatever you have on the   inside of it this is noticeably different and i'm  really digging the light grilling of the actual   flatbread itself so again with all the good stuff  on the inside just a lovely situation all around   all right on to the loaded chicken flatbread  taco and this one definitely has a lot more   going on with it guys obviously as you can  see from the close-up here lots of greenery   lots of tomatoes there's plenty of chicken  on the inside that i can feel in the bottom   of my fingers actually along with the avocado  ranch and the three cheese blend and of course   that grilled flatbread action let's get into  this one and yes i'm going in tomatoes and all well you've definitely got two very distinct  flavor profiles with both of these flatbread tacos   guys what's really making this one for me right  now is the avocado ranch sauce along with that   flap red that is a beautiful situation because  the softness that i'm getting from the flatbread   and the flavor from the avocado ranch is taking  this one up instantly and then you get into the   crunch naturally of the lettuce and of course  the chicken that's buried in there but guys very   delicious on this so far let's go for another  bite i'll give you a close-up but on the real   i think i'm digging this one more over the  beefy potato variant let's keep going in oh yeah i do well more ingredients tends  to equal more flavor and that's what i'm   getting with this one guys nothing against the  seasoned beef and the potatoes and the cheese   sauce of the previous one but this one has got  it going on that avocado ranch with the chicken   is amazing and of course the nice softness  of the flatbread and the toastiness of it   is definitely on point add in that crunch of the  lettuce and the tomatoes if you're down for that   and you've got a very hearty little sandwich  here actually guys that's what it feels like   pretty nice you know none of these flatbread  tacos in my opinion really need any type of   sauce because the flavor is so rich and  distinct on each of them and with this   one in particular i gotta say with that  ranch being one of my favorites anyway   i'm a little more biased towards ranch because of  what it is it's my favorite type of dipping sauce   but guys a lovely situation with this and again  the softness of that flatbread is really nice   i can't stress the fact that this is just a buck  and that is a very very nice quality price point   i think for what you're getting here guys very  very solid overall and again very delicious   very delicious indeed let's go for another bite  on this one because i clearly want to let's go you know i gotta be honest when i first flipped  the flatbread open on this one i was a   little concerned with the amount of greenery that  i had over actual chicken but i've actually got a   very decent amount on the inside of this guys and  again it goes so amazing with the avocado ranch   it's nice and smooth nice and rich and overall  just adds to the overall experience with this   one just feels like it's just got more going  on on the inside because naturally it does   but overall this is definitely worth the dollar  guys because of what you're getting in here   pretty nice all right so let's go for one  more bite on this one then we'll wrap up   this double review with a couple of ratings  guys but again a very lovely situation and   guys again i keep beating this one to death it's  just a buck that's pretty solid one more bite well what you're looking at here is a couple of  lovely situations guys and again for a dollar   each this is a pretty banging value right now  a couple of these i think is all you really   need to fill you up and really satisfy you  and obviously with what you're getting here   two very distinct flavor profiles going for the  chicken crowd and the beef crowd and obviously   the potato crowd because that's pretty awesome as  well but a nice combination of flavors all around   wrapped up in some pretty tasty grilled flatbread  lovely stuff order ahead and pick yours up at our   contactless drive-thru so jumping right to the  ratings i'm going to have to give the new beefy   potato flatbread taco here at taco bell a pretty  solid 7.5 out of 10 like i said this is not   going to win any awards for originality it's not  reinventing the wheel but what you are getting is   that familiar taco bell flavor with some pretty  nice tasty flatbread action to go with and guys   the softness is definitely what makes it with  that one aside from the overall flavors now it's   a little bit elevated in salt but even still very  very tasty and of course classic taco bell flavor   and as for the loaded chicken flatbread taco that  one's gonna cruise along with an easy   9 out of 10 guys again very familiar flavor over here  at taco bell but the addition of that flatbread   really takes this one up a notch and really  combines to give you a beautiful flavor profile   in general with the five ingredients that it's got  i mean guys it's just delicious stuff all around   and of course that avocado ranch is a banging  situation in general and of course again   for the five millionth time these are just a buck  i mean come on alright so a couple of quick   questions for you aside from the usual are you  going to be giving this one a shot because i   always ask you guys that and if you've made it  this far into the review i'd venture to guess   you're probably going to which one are you looking  forward to trying the most and why drop those   comments down below and
