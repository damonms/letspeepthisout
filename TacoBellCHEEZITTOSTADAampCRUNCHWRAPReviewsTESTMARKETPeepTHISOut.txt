 what's going on everyone and welcome or welcome  back to the channel it's Ian K where today i'm   over at a test location for taco bell in irvine  california because they've got a couple of items   on the menu that actually have cheez-its in them  well truth be told it's one big cheez-it so stay   tuned because the big cheez it tostada and  the big cheez it crunchwrap are both up next   welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty yes sir i'm definitely down for some big cheez it  action over here at taco bell this is definitely   something fun to check out right now guys very  cool looking with these two items and at first   glance it doesn't look like anything different  from taco bell but let's take a closer look shall   we starting off with the big cheez it tostada and  as you can see lots of taco bell goodness on the   top of this one what we've got here is seasoned  beef reduced fat sour cream shredded lettuce diced   tomatoes and shredded cheddar cheese all on top  of an oversized cheez-it square guys that is very   very cool apparently it's 16 times the size of a  regular cheez it square and you gotta love it   guys that is just really really nice definitely  big and it's taking up this carton pretty nicely   and as we pan on over to the other star of the  show the big cheez it crunchwrap and guys i'm   very excited about this one the classic crunchwrap  with all the goodies on the inside starting   off with seasoned beef of course nacho cheese  sauce shredded lettuce reduced fat sour cream   diced tomatoes and an oversized cheez it  cracker instead of the usual tostada shell   taking the place so even more cheesiness right  there and of course it's all wrapped up into   that tortilla and then pressed very nicely i have  it split in half as you can see all the goodies   are on display i really can't wait to get into  this one this is really looking pretty awesome   all right so let's not waste any more time on this  one let's get down to business these are the all   new intest big cheez it tostada and big cheez it  crunchwrap here at taco bell let's peep out this   flavor yes sir all the taco bell goodness that you  know and love on the top of a big cheez-it square   very very cool i have to say i think this is going  to fit pretty nicely with taco bell considering   it's cheesy anyway this is going to be pretty nice  let me lift up a little piece of this here and   this is already breaking apart but i'm going to  lift up a little piece of it there we go a little   bit of everything actually now as you can see that  cracker on the bottom that's a full-on cheez-it   very very cool here we go it's the big cheez it  tostada here at taco bell let's see how this is very cheesy wow the toasty factor of the actual cheez-it  itself very very nice that's actually a very   rich flavor and the fact that it is very large  like this really says a lot because it's adding   even more cheesiness to what's already here let  me try and lift up another chunk of this this is   kind of falling apart considering it's like well  over 100 degrees as i'm filming this right now   it's very hot but guys if you can imagine classic  cheez-it flavor with the usual goodies over here   at taco bell that's exactly what this is and again  i think it fits pretty nicely because taco bell   nacho cheese sauce shredded cheese any type of  cheese in general this fits pretty nicely just   to kind of be the doppelganger for the tostada  that this has got pretty cool let's keep going in mmm i like that very rich on those  cheeses there and the cracker it's   definitely holding its own right there guys  everything is kind of blending pretty nicely   wow i really like that let's do another couple  on this because i got to keep going in on it it's   very tasty i have to admit this is really nice  i mean even if they kind of made like cheez-its   as like nachos with something like this like  a whole bunch of them and covered with the   taco bell goodness that would be just as good  but this i have to say works pretty nicely so   they gave me a fork i'm not using it i'm  having fun with my hands let's keep going in mmm wow you can taste the  cheez it nice with this   really strong really strong actually really good  i just love how pungent this oversized cheez-it   square actually is i mean it's been a minute since  i've had cheez-its but it's instantly coming back   to me and it says a lot because the  flavor you can taste above and beyond   all the other flavors here at taco bell  got a nice little action of reduced fat   sour cream there and the seasoned beef and  of course with the lettuce the tomatoes the   shredded cheddar cheese on top of it pretty  nice guys let's go for another couple on this this needs to go national it fits very nicely wow yeah as fun as this is using my hands right  now i probably should have used a fork even still   but i am really digging the experience and as  you can see all of the goodness that you can   get in with this one here with that cheez it  action is totally worth it because the   cheesiness is really on point you can really  taste the toastiness of those cheez its nicely   and it goes very well with all the usual  flavors from taco bell as you'd expect   it too this is actually really really cool okay  now as cool as this is i am more excited to try   what i think is going to be the big gun  because i love the crunchwrap supreme   the crunchwrap in general and this actually  looks really really fantastic you know this   is going to be pretty bomb obviously it's  a carby situation with the extra shell on   the inside in this case it's going to be that  cheez-it oversized square very nice let's give   this a go it's the big cheez it crunchwrap  over here at taco bell let's give this a shot this is the one oh this is the one by far i mean  it's wrapped up good to go the nice softness of   the tortilla itself the cheese factor on the  inside it's a regular crunchwrap if you love   crunchwrap in general which i think a lot of you  guys do it's a very popular item over here at taco   bell imagine the addition of cheetos flavor not  cheetos but big cheez-its to go with this that's   exactly what you're gonna be getting that is a  really really nice little doppelganger for the   tostada shell and believe it or not now that i'm  getting into this further i think this opens up a   whole brand new category of goodness that they can  do over here at taco bell i mean imagine swapping   out the tostada shell not just with the big cheez  it naturally but imagine a doritos locos type of   situation with doritos cool ranch regular nacho  flamin hot there's a lot of things they can do   not just with the cheez-it it works well because  it's cheese but i can already see some other   things down the road with this taco bell if you're  watching right now chances are you're probably   thinking about that this is a great start to what  i think can be a whole new category of goodness   to push the other stuff that you're very good at  over here so let's go for another few on this wow it helps that the cheez it really  stands out wow really good and because   this is taco bell i gotta go into my favorite  hot sauce over here the fire action i'm gonna   prove it to myself right now how good this  is gonna be with the cheez-it action here   all right let's focus this in let's do  a little bit on the end over here and   i wanna see how the hot sauce actually is  with a big cheez-it let's give this a shot it's good man this thing is  a winner through and through   the flavor is pretty awesome  let's go for another one here   very nicely done with the cheez-it action and  hot sauce this works extremely well hang on man yes sir this is definitely the one the  flavor that i'm getting from the cheez-it   along with all the other goodies on the inside  of this really stands out very strong above and   beyond just the crunch that you would get from  the regular crunchwrap you can really taste   what's giving it that crunch and in this case  you're getting a lot of toasted cheese flavor   it goes amazingly well with all the goodness  here so let's go for one more bite on this one   before we wrap this uh little look at this here  with some final thoughts at the end guys but i   am having so much fun checking this out this was  totally worth giving it a go and even though i'm   filming this literally in like 100+ degree weather  right now it is a banging situation these need to   go national they're a lot of fun to check out  one more bite and we'll close it out hang on well at $2.49 for the big cheez it tostada  that is just an okay price point for what   this is guys it's okay it's a little bit more of  a snack type of situation i think it's maybe a   little overpriced considering the size of it even  though the oversized goodness of the big cheez-it   is pretty cool still for what it is it really  delivers some pretty decent flavor and definitely   fun to check out but this is where it is at by far  at $4.29 this one is easily worth that if you ask me   this works extremely well all the classic flavors  of taco bell with some heavy cheez-it action to go   with a very lovely situation and again not only  do you get the crunch you get plenty of cheesy   flavor so they definitely win in that category  because that's delivered in spades very cool okay so being that these are currently in  test right now at taco bell down in irvine   california i'm not going to necessarily give a  rating to these because if they do go national   i definitely plan on checking these out again  but let me just say if they do go national   i am definitely going to be checking them out  again because the quality is pretty awesome i mean   it's classic taco bell flavor through and through  but just with the addition of big cheez it flavor   on top of it so it's a lot of fun to eat because  of the size and i have to admit the combination   of what you're getting there especially in the  crunchwrap is primo and on the real i got to say   the execution of this one like i said is more  tailored to what taco bell has got going on   over here i just think it fits better i mean the  last thing that i checked out was actually that   big cheez it pizza i believe from pizza hut it's  probably jumping up on your screen here right now   that was a lot of fun to check out for sure  but when it comes to this over here at taco   bell like i said it just fits because it's plenty  of cheesy flavor and it actually holds up pretty   nicely it doesn't get too mushy and that's  a testament to the big cheez it itself because   guys even with all that taco bell goodness on it  it's not necessarily falling apart too much and   you can really pretty much eat it with your hands  still but guys definitely something worth checking   out if this does go national i really hope it does  pretty solid all right so do me a quick favor drop   some comments down below let me know what your  thoughts are on these big cheez it items over here   at taco bell is this something that you'd like  to see go national is it something that you're   interested to try and what did you think of the  overall presentation of how they looked drop those   comments down below and definitely let me know  and with that this is
