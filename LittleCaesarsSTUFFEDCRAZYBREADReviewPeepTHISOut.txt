crazy bread is coming up next welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty pizza pizza well as Prince used to say during the Purple Rain era let's go crazy and I think we're about to do that with the stuffed crazy bread here at Little Caesars and guys first things first the aroma is pretty glorious in my car right now a nice mix of butter garlic and Parmesan and I got to say this is a very lovely situation my senses are lit up and I'm definitely liking what I'm seeing here three pieces of their crazy bread and it is stuffed with cheese and guys I got to say they don't look like the traditional pieces of crazy bread but I'm really diggin the overall length of what's in here right now three large pieces for dipping we've got some crazy sauce basically it's a kicked-up marinara pizza sauce and I think it's gonna go very nicely with this situation right over here so without further ado let's see if the flavors gonna deliver on this one it's the stuffed crazy bread here at Little Caesars let's peep out this flavor alright so right after the aroma with the stuffed crazy bread it immediately goes into the size of these things and guys I have to admit three of these this is actually a lovely situation they are pretty huge and I got to admit I am completely digging the size here let me show you one of these again that is craziness right now if I can try and focus that in that is nuts definitely coated and it looks like that one is kind of splitting right there with the cheese on the inside but very lovely situation I'm not gonna waste too much more time because I

you first here see if we can get a little bit of cheesy action oh there we go not bad not bad at all as it's getting out of focus let me pull back over here look at this madness right now that is pretty nice guys here we go it's the stuffed crazy bread here at little caesars my fingers are lit up with butter here we go oh my god God did you really think this was gonna be bad oh man Wow guys let me pull this open for you I know it's all contrasty right now but man it's buttery toasted bread with lots of gooey cheese on the inside this is deadly right now this is straight out death right now in bread and cheese form but I'm telling you if you're gonna eat your feelings this is something you will really kind of enjoy right now it is really tasty mmm man this is insane I love bread I love garlic bread really chewy bread man add some cheese into the mix mmm oh my god you know what we're gonna kill this half I'm gonna go for a dip in some of this crazy sauce here right now guys this is off the chart right now in flavor mm-hmm I love the butteriness and that garlic a little bit of the light Parmesan coming up just to give you a little bit of extra saltiness this is delicious mmm that's absolutely insane and you knew it would be because how could it not I mean guys deliciously tasty chewy bread and we're going in with some of the crazy sauce here let's give this a shot look at that nice lovely situation they definitely give you a lot here too I was really surprised let's give this a go man this is a lovely lovely situation glad to be doing this for you right now let's go for this bite this is pretty awesome already bangin oh my god this is ridiculously awesome mmm you know what let's go for another this is insane at over 300 plus calories for one of these almost a thousand calories for all three insane guys you're definitely gonna want to share this eye thing or if your gluttonous just enjoy yourself but look at that that is really really good a very decent amount of cheese a good choice of sauce I'm almost thinking I should have got a little bit of ranch goodness to go with this but guys this is a nice combo pairing and of course it's crazy bread even though it's stuffed you got to have the crazy sauce to go with still pretty good hmm yes yes yeah I'm definitely gonna knock off this last piece because why not this is all we've got left but guys it's really really tasty the only thing is though I know they're using the crazy bread name but it's not nearly as stiff as the regular crazy bread naturally because of the cheese on the inside it's a little more of a flopper type of situation but the same taste is there so you're getting the garlicky goodness the buttery goodness the parmesan goodness to go with and a nice decent amount of cheese on the inside just to give you a decent look there that last bite all the way end to end you've got something on the inside here so very lovely situation with this let me go for one more last dip with this one we'll give you one last close-up of a regular full one here and then we'll close it out after the rating but guys delicious stuff you knew it would be I think you know what the score is gonna be let's just finish it up because I really really want to this is really delicious right now here we go deadly because of the calorie count but overall guys it is worth it these are really really flavorful they're packed with cheese and obviously you can kind of see how they make them by simply lighting them up on top of each other with that cheese on the inside but the quality is awesome they're super buttery this is like drenched right now and of course the garlic goodness to go with that parmesan a lovely situation and the toastiness is decent but even with all that toastiness it's still kind of a flopper right there guys they're very easily bendable but guys delicious stuff definitely give these a shot it's well worth the $3.50 pizza pizza come on it just needs to be said this stuffed crazy bread here a little caesars gets a rock-solid 10 out of 10 even though they're not as firm as the regular crazy bread for the namesake they're coming from they definitely satisfied in terms of the flavor and guys like I said the butteriness the garlicness the parmesaness of everything together was pretty amazing pair that up with that crazy sauce a very lovely situation but I think any sauce of choice would go good with it because you get a very decent amount of cheese on the inside so I'm not disappointed with that and well worth the 300 plus calories to knock off one of those easy recommendation okay now the obvious question are you gonna take me up on this recommendation to give this one a shot right now you make quick favor drop some comments down below are you a fan of
