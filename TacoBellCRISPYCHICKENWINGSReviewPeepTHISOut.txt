 hey everyone welcome back to another high quality  foodie feature for you here on the channel   with this time i'm over at taco bell to check  out their all new crispy chicken wings now   available nationwide for a limited time only  that's right and being that i actually already   checked these out when they were in test  back in 2020 i thought i'd swing on over   to see if these were actually just a little bit  different so stay tuned because they're up next   welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty so here we go with crispy chicken wings 2.0 the  nationwide release here at taco bell and all those   familiar memories are definitely coming back  to me the first time around when i tried these   guys the crispy goodness is definitely looking  on point and the presentation overall is just   looking pretty dynamite in this box all right so  very simply what we've got here is a combination   of bone-in drums and flats and they seem to be  coated in this mexican queso seasoning which is   a little bit different from the first time around  i believe it was just a regular bold mexican   spices they were advertising then so i'm thinking  there's going to be a little cheesy goodness with   this one hopefully but aside from that i have to  say the overall size of each of these is not too   bad this one in particular that you're looking at  is coated up very nicely and it is very thick so   overall for $5.99 for a five piece this is actually  not a bad deal considering what i've got here   yes sir definitely pretty cool and obviously for  dipping we got to go in on something right and in   this case we're gonna go with their spicy ranch  dipping sauce which i believe is the same from   the last time around as well and being that i'm  a huge fan of ranch i am absolutely excited to   give this one a go again with it so there you go  it's their all new crispy chicken wings apparently   only available for a week beginning january 6th  here at taco bell let's peep out this flavor   yes sir this looks like an exact duplicate of what  i reviewed the last time around with the exception   of that mexican queso seasoning this supposedly  has but on the real it still presents exactly   the same way the box is the same and overall the  crispy goodness is on point so let me lift up to   one of these here to show you again look at that  guys you can really see that seasoning beautifully   on this one here it looks like it's got a little  bit of cheesy action going with it but the   crispiness is absolutely on point and considering  $5.99 for five of these not a bad deal considering   the overall size of these and again the crispiness  i keep coming back to it is just looking dynamite   so guys without further ado here we go crispy  chicken wings 2.0 the nationwide release only   available after 2pm apparently beginning january 6th  just for one week let's give it a shot here we go oh yeah come on just like i remember you know i  didn't refresh myself on my original review when i   checked these out over a year ago guys but i think  what i remember saying with that one is the salt   level may have been just a little bit up there and  i'm not really getting that so much with this but   the seasoning is absolutely pronounced so it's  not super salty initially but the crunchiness is   definitely on point but guys all the white meat  action on the inside of this is very nice you   can't beat bone and wings it really is the way  to go and i'm totally digging the presentation   nice and juicy the white meat is looking pretty  awesome and again i really love the fact that it's   not elevated in salt so far i am really liking  these let's keep going in guys pretty tasty stuff man so banging yeah i'm gonna be swinging back  to get these throughout the week a couple of more   times i have a feeling guys because this feels a  little bit different now that i'm getting further   into it here the flavor is absolutely better  it's not nearly as salty as i remember and   overall the coating is just beautiful on this  it's that classic fried coating but again with   a little bit of zip that it's got here from that  mexican queso seasoning i'm not really getting a   cheesy vibe with this but it's definitely nice  and it adds a nice amount of flavor overall   but aside from all of that it really begs  the question why only one week in terms of   availability nationwide across the country  maybe they just want to maybe gauge the   response initially to kind of see what the take  rate would be but i have a feeling curiosity is   really going to kind of increase this in general  and when you know you've only got a weekend i   guess people are going to be rushing to give  this one a shot still i have a feeling this   is going to be back already guys because like  i said it's done very very well let's go for   a few more bites and of course we're going to go  into some of that ranch we got to do that hang on so satisfying right now so good i think one of the  things that i really like about these is the fact   that you don't expect something like this from  taco bell i mean naturally it's completely out   of the blue when this was announced the first time  over a year ago i was like chicken wings over at   taco bell but nachi of course it's got their  spin on it with the bold mexican spices then   the fact that we have something similar now  and it's coming with spicy ranch which is   the perfect pairing guys how could you  not right pretty tasty stuff so good okay let's get into some ranch let me keep that  focus for you because we're gonna get this one   nice and lathered up with the good stuff guys  absolutely spicy ranch action with some crispy   chicken wings over here at taco bell you know  we're getting into this right now let's hit it come on whoa so freaking good the lights tart  the tang everything about this spicy ranch   goes amazing with the crispy goodness guys let's  just keep going in this is a beautiful situation   man so lovely indeed hopefully  that's staying focused for you   so freaking delicious right  now really really good let's go man it's so freaking amazing it really  is for fast food wings it's done very well come on all day long all right i think you  get the point with this already guys a very   lovely situation indeed let me hold up another  one of these real quick just to round this one   out i'm kind of considering this  review a companion to my original one   and i'm so glad that they really kind of dialed  back the salt in my opinion with this on top of it   these are definitely better overall and i gotta  say guys again the presentation is just beautiful   look how beautifully fried and crispy this is  definitely run do not walk to give these a shot   it's highly worth your time order ahead and  pick yours up at our contactless drive-thru   so with that said i'm gonna have to give the 2.0  version of these all-new crispy chicken wings here   at taco bell a pretty rock solid 9 out of 10 guys  this one really delivers the flavor across the   board and for fast food chicken wings it gets  the job done especially with that spicy ranch   but if there's one knock with this particular  version it's the fact that there's only limited   availability and there's only one size available  because i can easily see myself wanting to go   in on more than just the five that are there and  granted you can just buy more of them but having   some more flavor options maybe some different  choice options things that you can kind of combine   as time goes by i have no doubt these are going  to be back on the menu at some point en masse   and maybe with some of those different flavors  but still what it's got it definitely does well   not really getting a queso vibe from it but the  spicing is beautiful and the salt is absolutely   dialed back at least on the version that i'm  reviewing right now it definitely gets the job   done like i said run do not walk to give these  a shot it's highly worth your time to check out   all right so if you've made it this far into the  review i'd venture to guess you've already made   up your mind about these already and you're  probably going to be giving them a shot so   do me a quick favor drop some comments down  below confirm all that goodness for me and let   me know if you'd like to see them back in the  menu with some different versions in the near   future that would be pretty awesome drop those  comments down below and definitely let me know   and with that this is Ian K closing out another  high quality foodie feature for you here on peep   this out reviews bringing you brand new content  every single week here on my channel so while you stay   tuned for that next review coming real soon in the  meantime stay frosty yes sir don't wait to bring   this back onto your menu taco bell after that week  is over because you already know this is going   to be a hit everyone is going to be running to  give these a shot definitely bring this one back   hopefully by summer time maybe some extra flavor  something different and
