 what's going on everyone and welcome back  to another high quality foodie feature for   you here on the channel where this time i'm  over at little caesars because it looks like   we've got another national pizza chain that's  diving into some plant-based goodness for one   of their most popular pizza toppings so without  further ado let's get into what they're calling   the planteroni pizza and already guys i'm digging  the way the presentation looks on this one even   though the pepperoni does look a little different  but starting off with the obvious what we've got   here is a standard large round pizza topped off  with the usual goodness here we've got the blend   of mozzarella and muenster cheeses a little bit of  their tangy sauce underneath that but showcased   on the very top is the main star of the show the  field roast plant-based pepperoni and i gotta say   guys it's looking a little less greasy as i'd  expect to find from a pepperoni pizza you can   see it looks a little drier but at the same time  it looks very similar in color and i gotta say   every single slice looks to be populated pretty  decently with this good stuff here guys so let's   not waste any more time on it let's get into it  it's the all new planteroni pizza from little   caesars let's peep out this flavor yesir lots of  cheesy goodness to contrast with that pepperoni on   the very top guys it looks very authentic and  of course with all the cheesy goodness that's   mixing in with it that's the best part about it  if you ask me lots of really great stuff here   all right pizza in the car is always a difficult  situation it's crazy hot outside let me pull one   of these slices up and yeah this looks really  authentic take a look at that guys really   impressed with the pepperoni on this it's a little  less greasy looking so a lot of you may think that   this is not real pepperoni because it doesn't have  the trademark oils and i'm not used to seeing that   on little seasons with pepperoni but hey again the  presentation is very very cool on this guys and an   alternative to regular pepperoni this looks really  really nice at least the way that it looks anyway   let's see about that flavor here we go with the  planteroni pizza from little caesars let's do it we're right off the break i got a lot of nice tang  from the tomato sauce underneath the cheese and of   course the cheesy goodness to go with and then  the flavor of the pepperoni came in guys let me   pull this one of these off here so you can take a  look at this this is actually very very authentic   tasting it's got the right spicing so it feels  like it's pepperoni and the flavor obviously is   very reminiscent of that because of the spicing  but guys as you can see it's fairly lean as it's   glistening in the light right there there's not a  lot of oil on it whatsoever so it's a little drier   but at the same time i'm digging the  quality let's keep going in pretty nice it's good though well here's a nice side by shot  of a couple of slices of that pepperoni and as   you can see guys while it is a little on the  drier side it does look seasoned pretty nicely   the flavor that i'm getting is very reminiscent of  pepperoni it's got a little bit of the mouth feel   of that as well as you're chewing it but naturally  where the moisture is coming from instead of the   oils of regular pepperoni it's coming more from  the cheese and the tomato sauce so the combination   does work and believe it or not it does feel a  little bit like a lighter slice of pepperoni pizza   you know on the reel i'm kind of glad little  caesars went the pepperoni route for the first   inaugural plant-based item on their menu because  naturally with the pizza hut variant that i did a   few months ago the beyond meat sausage that was  a pretty delicious authentic tasting topping as   well and you're probably seeing that review  popping up on your screen here right now you   should definitely check that review out if  you haven't already but let me just also say   as many of you know even though pepperoni  is not my all-time favorite pizza topping   this variation works for me because it's  not as oily and it's giving me the essence   of what pepperoni kind of tastes like because  it's very similar with the seasoning but guys   again it's with the cheese it's with all  the sauce and of course a nice standard   crust on the outside of this a very beautiful  situation in general let's keep going in i like it it's just that initial dryness is what's  kind of off-putting in the very beginning but   again the moisture of everything else that i'm  getting from the cheese the tomato sauce really   showcases the quality of this pretty nicely here  and as i'm trying to pull up one of these to show   you again guys as you can see it's seasoned  very nicely but it's really depending upon   the sauce and the cheese to kind of give you  the moisture with this one here but the flavor   is spot on so it really is a nice doppleganger  for regular pepperoni but with a little bit of   a healthier twist naturally because there's  no meat in it whatsoever let's keep going in so yeah guys this is a pretty tasty alternative  to what's out there right now in terms of what you   can get on top of a pizza that's plant-based  and there's not really very many of them   outside of pizza hut trying their sausage  a while back which i really enjoyed again   and now with this with pepperoni it's pretty good  so let me pick up another one of these slices here   and give you another shot i like the fact again  that it does not taste very greasy at all so that   may be a little bit off for some of you guys if  you like the oils of pepperoni but i gotta say   the flavor is definitely spot on with what it's  trying to imitate here the classic crust from   little seizures although i do wish it was a little  bit more toastier on the bottom everything else is   definitely swinging with it and when you have the  cheese when you have that sauce nice combination   and again this looks like a regular pepperoni  pizza minus the pepperoni so to speak pretty   nice pizza pizza so with that said i'm going to  have to give the all new planteroni pizza here a   little caesars a pretty decent 7.5 out of 10 now  coming from someone whose favorite topping is not   pepperoni this did a very good job like i said of  simulating the real deal the only downside however   is it's a little on the dry side on its own but  even still the presentation delivers the overall   flavor delivers because it tastes like pepperoni  and generally it's not bad for the price too $8.49   all right a couple of questions for you first  and foremost are you going to be giving this   one a shot drop some comments down below let  me know if you're going to be giving this one   a go and when you do let me know if you liked  it or not and secondly what are your thoughts   on all these plant-based alternatives  when it comes to meats for pizza toppings   drop those comments down below and definitely let  me know and with that this is Ian K closing out   another high quality foodie feature for you here  on peep this out reviews bringing you brand new   content every single week here on my channel so  while you stay tuned for that next movie coming real soon   in the meantime stay frosty all right little  caesars i see you but honestly i think the   writing is absolutely on the wall with this one  when are we going to see a deep deep dish variant   using this plant-based pepperoni i mean  that's got to be coming out soon right   all right everyone until next time i'll talk to  you soon hey thanks for checking out another one   of my reviews but just in case you didn't
