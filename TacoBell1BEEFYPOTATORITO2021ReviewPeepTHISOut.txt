 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty hey everyone welcome back to another high quality  foodie feature for you here on the channel where   this time i'm over at taco bell because with the  recent return of potatoes to their menu it looks   like we've got the obvious return of another  fan favorite featuring them and guess what it   just happens to be a buck that's right and as  you already know it's the beefy potato rito and   i gotta say guys this looks pretty sizable for  a dollar a nice warm tortilla for sure and it's   got some length to it there and of course the heft  is absolutely there this is already looking like   it's worth a dollar for sure let me split this  down the middle and we'll take a look guys but   so far pretty hefty and it looks like that value  based heft is confirmed guys for a dollar this is   actually looking pretty decent on the inside  featuring a combination of seasoned beef we   got those potato bites a nacho cheese sauce and  chipotle sauce pretty nice ingredients list of   goodness here from taco bell all wrapped up good  to go and i gotta say again pretty sizeable for a   dollar guys this is looking pretty awesome and  hey it just happens to be my first time trying   it as well so let's see if the flavor is going  to deliver on this one guys it's the return of   the beefy potato rito here at taco bell and you  know we're going to peep out this flavor yeah   man i'm not really expecting too much for a dollar  when i get these things but i got to say this is   definitely feeling hefty guys we've got a nice  sizable portion of the beef on the inside there   you can see those potatoes as well and of course  the nacho cheese sauce the chipotle goodness there   really nice seasoning and again for a half size  here so far guys what you're looking at not bad   so far for a dollar guys pretty nice and hey  like i mentioned this is my first time trying   it here so let's give it a shot guys it's the  beefy potato rito here at taco bell let's do it thick all right right off the bat let me just  say i'm not a super fan of french fries in   burritos and i think most of my regular viewers  know that by now but i have to say these type of   seasoned potatoes work pretty nice because they're  bite-sized and then the combination of the beef as   well going with it there and of course the cheese  and the chipotle it's a nice combination and again   the size is pretty decent guys this is literally  like maybe a three or four biter for each half as   far as i'm concerned i've got a lot left here  after that first bite this is looking pretty   nice and honestly for me i think the fact  that the potatoes are bite sized is making a   huge difference in my overall enjoyment so far  aside from the price point being just a buck   yeah this is already something i can see  myself getting again guys and like i said   for the value of what you're getting here this  is actually not bad it does feel kind of hefty   it's got a decent amount of filling on  the inside as well let's go in again oh yeah yeah this is definitely an  all-day long type of situation absolutely   i'm almost kind of wishing i got a little bit of  sour cream on the inside of this but whenever i   do my reviews i have to pretty much get them as  they're offered initially you can always upgrade   and add a lot of things to this naturally but with  the seasoned potatoes being the way that they are   it works amazingly well a little bit of the heat  that i'm getting from the chipotle sauce as well   and guys again the combination of all those  taco bell flavors the familiar ones it's really   singing pretty nicely and hey for a dollar  it's making that beautiful music sound even   more amazing as it's singing along here so  let's go for one more bite guys it's kind of   a quickie review for what this is but a very  cool value item that i'm really glad is back   on the menu my first time trying it we'll  finish this one up after the rating hang on   yesir taco bell flavors through and through  but with the new potatoes for me anyway this   is really taking this one up a notch guys and i  have to say the combination of all those flavors   from taco bell work amazingly well with it of  course the nacho cheese sauce and the chipotle   sauce goes amazing with the beef when you add  in the nice denseness of these potatoes that are   seasoned on their own definitely a great value  for a buck and a hearty little sucker at that   so with all that said i'm gonna have to give  the returning beefy potato rito here at taco   bell again my first time giving it a shot over  here are pretty rock solid   8.5 out of 10 guys i'm not gonna go much higher than  that strictly because the ingredients are very   familiar tasting i mean guys of course it is taco  bell the main flavors of the beef the cheese the   chipotle sauce they're very familiar on top of  the tortilla naturally there it's gonna taste   exactly like you'd expect it to but i got to admit  the potatoes really take this to a new dimension   and coming from some place personally for  myself where i don't like french fries and   potatoes just because of the denseness and the  carbiness that it adds the fact that these are   bite-sized and they're pretty plentiful on  their own but small enough where they really   don't distract everything else together  everything begins to work pretty nicely so guys   a pretty nice value like i said for a buck and  it's a hearty little sucker like i mentioned   earlier pretty tasty all right so i've got one  simple question for all of you peeps out there   who really love the potatoes over here at taco  bell and are super ecstatic that they're back   are you really super ecstatic that the beefy  potato rito is especially back on the menu   drop those comments down below and definitely  let me know and with that this is Ian K closing   out another high quality foodie feature for you  here on peep this out reviews bringing you brand   new content every single week here on my channel  so while you stay tuned for that next review coming real   soon in the meantime stay frosty oh yes we are  definitely doing a little bit of sour cream maybe   some guacamole for the next time out with this one  you know actually maybe some red strips as well   why don't we just make
