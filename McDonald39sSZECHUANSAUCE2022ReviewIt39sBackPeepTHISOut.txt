 what's going on everyone and welcome or welcome  back to the channel it's Ian K where today i'm   over a good old mickey d's to check out the return  of szechuan sauce to their menu for a limited time   only so stay tuned because it's up next welcome  to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty all right so here we go with the extremely hyped  return of the szechuan sauce here to mickey d's   guys and this time out it's outfitted with some  beautiful gold packaging i'm totally digging the   presentation with this one and i think it may  be playing with my head just a bit to kind of   tell me there's going to be some golden flavor at  hand let me break this one down for you real fast   all right so this time out we've got some fun  packaging with four separate containers spread   out with the word szechuan very cool there and of  course the main one with the actual word of course   across it and i'm going to be combining what i  think is going to be some pretty tasty goodness   with 10 pieces of additional goodness guys the  famous chicken mcnuggets of course that all   white meat action crispy outer coating you already  know what it is that timeless flavor and of course   it's going to be the perfect pairing to go with  these naturally so i can't wait to get into these   so yeah guys those chicken mcnuggets should pair  up very nicely with what's supposed to be a sweet   flavor profile with hints of ginger garlic soy and  mild vinegar and guys again the hype is extremely   real on this let me crack this open we'll get into  this really fast oh yeah it is definitely strong   in the soy and teriyaki department you can really  smell that pretty nicely there as you can see it's   looking very thick all right let me pick up  one of these nuggs we'll give this a shot for   you real fast very thick guys very very thick  it almost kind of looks like a sweet and sour   dark sweet and sour sauce as you can see here but  very nice in the thickness department let's give   this a go it's the golden szechuan sauce returning  to mickey d's for a limited time only let's do it heavy soy sauce teriyaki then the garlic light  ginger this is kind of like what i remember   the last time because it is the same but that  teriyaki and the soy is very very strong on this   mmm i like that it's good it's not going to  replace my hot mustard but the flavor is strong   and you know what because i've actually  brought the original one with me   take a look at what it was before if you  guys remember from my previous review   this is actually the original packaging from 2018  take a look at that review jumping up on your   screen right now if you haven't seen it this is  like i think at the third or fourth time i believe   this is actually back but i have to say not that i  missed it i mean i really didn't miss it the fact   that we're getting something very familiar  here is a lovely situation so let's go for   another couple on these this is actually really  really tasty still very strong in the teriyaki   but especially the soy a little bit of garlic  not so much ginger maybe lightly at the very end it goes good with the  nuggets though it really does   of course the white meat action  of the nugs tries to focus him   very nice crispy situation i gotta tell you i  think they kind of missed the boat by promoting   their tenders the buttermilk chicken tenders  the last time out those were amazing as well   take a look at the review jumping up on your  screen i think it was the barbecue variant   there's been so many different versions that i've  tried you can also take a look at the mcdonald's   playlist on my channel but they should have  brought back the tenders doused in the szechuan   sauce that would have been a cool promo along  with this but i'm digging it so far it's not bad definitely nice all right one more because this  is pretty good right now let's just keep going in   a little dunking action nice and crispy and  again very heavy on the soy and teriyaki i   mean i see why it's a favorite i see why it's  popular but it's not going to replace a ranch   it's not going to replace the hot mustard for me  anyway but i'm digging it it's fun to check out   well now let's see teriyaki goes pretty good  with this crispy coating on the outside of the   nugs here these chicken mcnuggets are amazing  always when they're super fresh especially   really good stuff all right let's go for one more  on this one because i think you get the point   it's very very cool to actually have this  back on the menu again hopefully they won't   wait too long this time out considering what  it was like three years ago four years ago   plus since the last time out when i checked  it out this is still pretty nice to go in on   pretty good and again i am totally digging the  foil packaging but as you can see they pretty much   reused the one from 2018 here so very very slick  okay overall i'm gonna have to give the returning   szechuan sauce over here mickey d's like a   7.5 out of 10 i mean it's pretty much like   i expected it to be just a new label naturally  i love the fact that they spread out over the   four packages which is pretty cool but of course  getting the main one of course for collectors if   you're gonna be keeping this type of thing that's  cool as well or go for all five you can actually   purchase them in the app this was actually free  for me to get right now there was no price when   i actually selected this not sure why but i'm  not gonna complain either but super fun to check   out either way the flavor is pretty awesome it's  very familiar that you remember from the szechuan   sauce the last time out no rick and morty this  time out as well but i'm still digging over all   what we've got here pretty nice all right so very  simply do me a quick favor drop some comments down   below let me know how excited you are to give the  szechuan sauce a shot over here because i think   like i always say if you've made it this far into  the review you're pretty excited at this point or   at least you're mildly curious at least from a  packaging standpoint right i mean these do look   pretty cool in the golden packaging drop those  comments down below and definitely let me know   and with that this is Ian K closing out another  high quality foodie feature for you here on peep   this out reviews bringing you brand new content  every single week here on my channel so while you stay   tuned for that next review coming real soon in  the meantime stay frosty yup some pretty cool gold  foil packaging this time out with the szechuan  sauce but mcdonald's i really hope you produced   an even amount across the board because i have a  feeling some collectors are going to want to make   sure they have all four of these just saying all  right guys until next time i'll talk to you soon   hey thanks for checking out another  one of my reviews but just in case you   didn't see the one before this one  you can find it right up over here   along what i think youtube's gonna recommend  for you to check out as well as always i think   you'll find something
