 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K   stay frosty what's going on everyone and  welcome to the channel where today I'm over at   Pizza Hut to take a look at their latest promo  that's literally 24 plus years in the making   that's right you guys begged you guys pleaded  and now it's finally here back after 24 plus   years guys the big New Yorker pizza and this  is looking absolutely insane I can barely hold   this in front of the camera here steady anyway  let me break this one on down for you real fast   yes sir something this big is obviously going  to come in a bigger size box guys 16 inches of   XL Fury to be exact and this is looking pretty  nice so basically what this is is a super extra   large pizza with six oversized slices that  are actually topped off with double pepperoni   sweet marinara sauce extra cheese and Parmesan  oregano seasoning all the classic flavors from   New York the inspired goodness here with  this one and I gotta say it is looking really   really nice the presentation is pretty killer on  this one you have to admit it looks pretty great   and one thing that's really standing out for  me outside of the size of these pieces guys   is the fact that the double pepperoni has the  cup and crisp and the regular pepperoni action   in effect with this one so guys let's not waste  any more time on this let's get into it it's the   returning big New Yorker pizza here at Pizza Hut  after 24 plus years let's peep out this flavor   that's right Baby It's the Return of the King  and I'm not talking about Lord of the Rings   guys you already know what it is this just  looks really really awesome really really   nice in the presentation department and that  Aroma is lighting up my car beautifully here   right now so let me put this on down and  again very very huge box here in the car   I'm gonna pick up a slice here and wow this  is definitely oversized take a look at this   action guys foldable goodness right here New York  style the thin crust is looking pretty nice it's   definitely got a pretty nice undercarriage here  as well no real flopping with this one that is   really cool and again with the double pepperoni  the crisp and cup and the regular size I gotta   say guys very nice with that cheese you know  what let me fold this one here let's kind of   do it whoa as I almost lose the slice Let's  Fall this over and give it that New York feel   here there you go guys very nice with this  one let's give this a shot it's the returning   big New Yorker pizza here at Pizza Hut let's  peep this out this really looks pretty banging mmm tasty well right off the break this is simulating the  experience of having a New York slice pretty   nicely guys I mean the oversized goodness  here of course is absolutely on point the   thinness of it as well but honestly it doesn't  really taste like New York believe it or not it   really just tastes like a pretty nice pepperoni  slice of pizza from Pizza Hut so let me go in a   little bit further I'm going to explain a  little bit further but guys so far this is   just super fun to eat right now and I love the  fact that it's foldable it's almost like having   a sandwich technically right two pieces of bread  all the goodness in the middle right over there   and again the double pepperoni action the cup  and crisp action that nice little carry over from   the Detroit style pizza that's a banging  Choice with this one let's keep going in mmm well you pepperoni heads are really going  to love this one guys because there is a nice   amount of the goodness across the board with  this one the Crisp and cup adds a nice little   bit of crunch and it's definitely adding  overall to the crunchiness that I'm getting   from the crust itself it doesn't really have  that New York feel meaning that the taste is   pretty much like a Pizza Hut pizza like I said  if you guys have been to New York and naturally   I grew up there up until about 11 years old  came out here in 1984. if you're any type of   pizza Aficionado most of you guys know it's  all about the water recipe back East there's   something in the water that makes the pizza  taste so much better in New York and I can't   really explain it other than that but you know  it when you taste it this is actually a very   nice evolutionary step up from that naturally  here on the West Coast because it's trying to   mimic some of that goodness but naturally with  all this Classic Pizza Hut ingredients of course   so I'm digging this let's go for a couple  more bites on it we'll get further in hang on it's good though you know one thing I really do like about this  is the crust in the very back because it does   feel pretty authentic in that regard guys because  New York Pizza typically has a little bit more of   a crunchier type of outer crust and I really  like the fact that you can really see it there   the distinction is really really nice on this  and of course with that marinara sauce and the   sauce itself there along with the cheese mixing  together of course it's a nice combination but   again it's Pizza Hut ingredients so there's  going to be a little bit of a difference in   terms of authenticity I'm definitely digging  the fact that it's New York inspired because   it looks the part it almost tastes the part  but it's not quite there but it's still very   very tasty for what it is and guys like I said  if you're a pepperoni head you have a lot to   look forward to with this one let me go for just  a couple more on this one outside of the two that   I think I said I was gonna take with it there  because I really want to kind of get further in   here guys I'm enjoying it it's fun but I think the  fact that it's oversized is really enhancing the   experience for me right now it feels like I'm  having two regular slices of pizza hut Pizza   not the pan style the thin and at the same time I'm  digging that so let's go for a couple more mmm the back crust is good that's really good actually so yeah I can see why a lot of you peeps have been  screaming for this one online to come back after   24 plus years guys because the presentation is  pretty killer and pizza hut hasn't had something   like this since naturally so it's nice to see a  return to form of something like that but again   just a little bit different in terms of what this  actually is compared to a true New York slice but   at the same time it's done the West Coast way and  the fact that they're not saying it's exactly New   York Pizza it's New York inspired so very tasty  very safe with this one and I gotta say I'm still   digging it for $13.99 not bad for what this is  for six oversized slices I'm definitely digging   the box I think the Box looks incredible on  the outside and they're really championing   the fact that it's back and I know a lot of  you guys are excited about that so let's go   for one more bite we'll wrap the review with  the rating coming up next but I'm glad to have   given this one a shot being that I'm a true New  Yorker naturally transplanted out to the West   Coast this is still pretty banging one more  bite and we'll close it out hang on here's another shot of one of the other slices guys and this one is a little bit more in line with a regular New York cut the one that I   had there was a little bit more oversized but as  you can see this is still looking pretty good the   fact that you have a lot of pepperoni on this  especially is cause for concern because of the   grease on the very bottom of this one if you can  see that but at the same time I really love the   overall flavor and like I said it's mimicking  the fact that this is trying to be a New York   slice really in essence and at the same time the  appearance is kind of playing with my head just a   little bit I love the crust in the very back  and overall The Experience about having this   one right now is a lot of fun especially to film  it for you guys here on the channel pretty tasty   no one out pizzas the Hut so with that said  I'm gonna have to give the returning big New   Yorker pizza here at Pizza Hut a pretty Rock Solid  8.3 out of 10 and I'm going a little above eight   guys because it really is playing with my head in  terms of the presentation this is really kind of   dressed up in quote unquote New York Clothing so  to speak it looks the part it's got the crust in   the back but at its core it's still a Pizza Hut  pizza so like I said the recipe back East really   differentiates the overall quality in terms of  the flavor because it really has something to   do with the water that they put into the dough  there's just something very unique about it on   top of the ingredients being just a little bit  different a little bit more of the Tang I think   back East would have been better but with this  I gotta say it looks the part it almost feels   the part the size is good and again it's a pretty  decent doppelganger for an East Coast pie here on   the West Coast it's definitely worth checking  out and if you've made it this far into the   review you're most likely gonna right all right  so do me a quick favor drop those comments down   below let me know if you are going to be giving  this one a shot and if you've had authentic New   York pizza from Back East naturally drop those  comments down below let me know what you truly   thought about this pie compared to that is this  a pretty good doppelganger in your opinion drop   those comments down below and definitely let
