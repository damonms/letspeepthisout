 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty hey everyone it's Ian K back again with another high quality foodie feature for you here on peep this out reviews this time back over at wendy's once again to check out the return of their awesome pretzel goodness and in this case it's the side item to go with it check out their bacon pub fries a very solid portion of their natural cut sea salt fries topped off with beer cheese shredded cheddar cheese and applewood smoked bacon and i gotta say this is looking very very tasty indeed as you can see a very solid amount of the cheese all throughout and a fairly decent amount of that bacon as well so let's not waste any more time on this one let's see if it's going to deliver it's their all-new bacon pub fries here at wendy's let's peep out this flavor yeah you know it wouldn't really be wendy's if they didn't take off some of the ingredients from their latest promo burger and put it on some of their fries they do it with just about every burger they've come out with and you guys can take a look at the wendy's playlist popping up on your screen right now for all the reviews i've done over the years for proof of that but i gotta say guys again this is a very lovely situation of goodness here you really can't go wrong with a cheese sauce of any type and fries and when you add bacon into the mix let's just give this a go real fast here i cannot wait to give this a shot let me pick up some of this here there is a lot of gooey goodness here and while i'm doing this and trying to get some of this on the fork if you guys

drops every week guys feast your eyes on the goodness we've got beer cheese goodness here we've got shredded cheddar cheese and of course a little bit of that bacon action let's do it oh the cheese is thick i can barely talk right now super flavorful it almost tastes like a gruyere type of cheese it's very pasty very thick very dense and of course the applewood smoked bacon you guys already know the bacon is insane over here at wendy's crispy goodness right there just you really can't beat it the apple would smoked goodness the light salt from the sea salt fries just a very decadent situation i'm gonna go for more because this is so good let's go for that bite right there it's really good man perfect compliment to that burger perfect compliment yeah i really love it when wendy's does this with their fries naturally you'd expect it because it's kind of like their m.o. lots of bacon on this guys it's popping all over the place here let me lift a little more of this up for you right now this is just loveliness loveliness loveliness i love the accent of the shredded cheddar cheese as you can see there really adds a nice color variation the pub cheese itself is a little bit more on the whiter side but just a really really great combination and again like i said the sea salt fries with the skin on them the natural cut really really solid and it really stands out above and beyond traditional fast food fries in my opinion just really really good yeah so yeah not too much else to say about this one here it's very thick it's very hearty it's very dense the portion size is decent $3.79 is what i got this one for here so it's a little bit more of a premium but you are getting two types of cheese and that trademark applewood smoked bacon and a fairly decent portion of fries here guys so a very solid side item i think to the pretzel goodness over here and something that i think you're gonna enjoy it's very flavorful as you'd expect it to be because of that cheese so with that said i'm gonna have to give the bacon pub fries here at wendy's a pretty rock solid 9 out of 10 now it virtually is a 10 out of 10 don't get me wrong guys the flavor is amazing on it very super flavorful in everything that it's got but for me personally i think a dollop of that beer cheese on the bottom of the container before the fries would have gone a long way because this one's a little bit more front loaded on top as they usually are here at wendy's but like i said the combination of the flavors absolutely delivers so don't let that 9 out of 10 fool you it virtually is a 10 out of 10 because it's so close to it anyway super delicious stuff all right so quick question for you whenever you go to wendy's do you personally upgrade your meal to go with these promo items on the side do you get like a loaded fries type of option what are some of the things that you like to get when you come to wendy's and actually are you still going to be giving this one a shot regardless and since we're on the topic of loaded fries what are some of the favorites you've had over the years here at wendy's drop those comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K
