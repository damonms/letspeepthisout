 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K  stay frosty what's going on everyone and   welcome to the channel where today I'm over  at Wendy's because I plan on staying Frosty   with their all-new Frosty and coincidentally  it's just in time for the holiday season too   that's right guys you already knows let's not  waste any more time with this one Feast your   eyes on the peppermint Frosty here at Wendy's  a very nice cup of deliciousness right here I   can't wait to get into it let's break this one  on down for you real fast all right so what   we've got here is their classic vanilla Frosty  this time mixed with peppermint flavoring just   in time for the holidays and I gotta say guys  I'm really digging that light pink tinge that   it's got in terms of the color definitely  looking pretty nice and of course with the   size of the cup here not bad in terms of portion  control it is definitely looking pretty inviting   and absolutely Frosty looking I'm totally digging  the clear cups they should always come like this   you know so I gotta say this is kind of reminding  me of the strawberry Frosty that I did a few   months back I mean the coloring of course is  going to look pretty similar but guys that's   where the similarities and aside from the Flavor  we're about to get into the aroma the smell coming   from this one actually is a very nice peppermint  and vanilla type of mix so I am totally digging   that very nice and because I'm on borrowed time  with this one let's just go for a nice little lift   look at that action right there guys very smooth  I can already tell this is going to be pretty   tasty let's get into it it's the peppermint  Frosty here for Wendy's let's peep this out mmm oh you know I'm not really a super  fan of minty type of desserts but that   is pretty nice it's probably not going  to focus too well but very tasty on this   mmm smooth rich wow of course you've got that  vanilla base that's in there and hopefully   that pink is kind of coming through in the  camera it looks really really nice as right   in front of me here it's a little bit more  white in terms of what you're looking at but   very smooth very rich creamy Frosty let's keep  going in mmm wow that is a lovely dessert a very   very lovely dessert let's go for a couple more  on this kind of a quickie review it melts very   fast but guys the flavor is Awesome on this  it's got notes of vanilla and obviously the   peppermint that's in there as well it's not  overpowering not super sweet but I love the   way that it smells on top of it that is really  nice this is a really cool holiday variation   of a classic favorite over here at Wendy's  pretty banging let's go for another couple mmm wow I am really liking this  naturally as you mix it up   it's a little bit more watery on the top but I've  got all the goodness on the very bottom right over   there that is just loveliness personified guys  loveliness personified so let's go for one more   scoop on this one very delicious flavor it doesn't  beat the classic vanilla as far as I'm concerned   with the chocolate but it's actually better  than the strawberry believe it or not and I   actually liked the strawberry I'm really digging  this and I'm surprised because like I said I'm   not really into peppermint type of desserts  and things like that but this is pretty nice   so one more bite we'll wrap the review with the  rating coming up next let's just close it out   mmm wow so yeah guys very surprising considering  like I said I'm not really into peppermint like   that but that actually works extremely well  with the vanilla Frosty over here at Wendy's   so everything you've seen and heard up to this  point obviously for a rating I'm gonna have to   give this one a solid 9 out of 10 guys a beautiful  situation in terms of the flavor it's subtle it's   not overly sweet super creamy and of course it's  got that vanilla base that you know and love from   the classic Frosty over here at Wendy's with  a little bit of that holiday Flair because of   the peppermint action so I love the subtleness  of it and definitely the presentation is very   inviting price Point's not too bad either and I  love the see-through cup very nice all right so   do me a quick favor drop some comments down below  if you've given this peppermint Frosty a shot over   here at Wendy's let me know what your initial  thoughts are of it and that's really a lot of   all the promos that they've had actually which  hasn't been too many here in the US they usually   have a lot
