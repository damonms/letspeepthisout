 what's going on everyone and welcome to the  channel it's Ian K where today i'm over at   pizza hut to check out one of their all new  oven baked pastas so stay tuned because i've   got the italian meats variant up next welcome  to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty wow this smells pretty awesome and things  are heating up very quickly in my hand with   this one right now guys let's get into it feast  your eyes on the oven baked italian meats pasta   i gotta say a lovely combination of goodness  with this one with plenty of cheese all right   so what you're looking at here appears to be  a very solid portion of penne pasta topped   off with a sweet tomato sauce pepperoni italian  sausage plenty of cheese shredded parmesan and   parmesan oregano seasoning and guys i gotta say  that combination is already looking and sounding   pretty amazing it is definitely oven baked very  hot very melted and i'm totally digging the   presentation this actually comes with five nicely  buttered breadsticks with lots of parmesan on the   very top of this one so a very cool value  for $8.99 i gotta say i am very much into   this right now the presentation like i said looks  phenomenal and it smells really awesome in the car   and as awesome as this looks believe me guys it  really does look pretty awesome it's very hot so   i'm holding a bunch of napkins on this right now  to kind of protect my hands but let's just get   into this really quick very excited to give this a  go there is a lot of cheese on this guys a lot of   cheese let me try and grab a little of everything  here it's a whole layer of cheese on the very top   of this here it is falling all over the place  but take a look at that guys very nice just by   diving into this it feels like the pasta is al  dente let me confirm it with the flavor for you   this is the all new oven baked pasta here at pizza  hut the italian meats variant let's peep this out come on lots of seasoning scratch that definitely  lots of seasoning that parmesan oregano action is   very strong on this one and with the cheese action  coming up on this as well guys plenty of that   mozzarella cheese action the pepperoni is adding  a nice little spice to it and the italian sausage   of course and confirming it for you al dente penne  pasta which is pretty banging let's keep going in wow this is crazy good and the portion guys that's  a large tin right there very very nice man we're   going to go for this a little bit more obviously  and we'll try some bread sticks real quick too but   very very nice on this guys plenty of parmesan  dusting all across this as you can see   plenty of melted cheese and lots of the  good stuff that sauce is not so much sweet   as it is robust in flavor and i am totally  digging that pretty nice let's keep going in wow their italian sausage is good it's  not little pellets actually nice little   chunks of italian sausage the real deal  i'd love to see a beyond meat version   of this actually that should be in the cards  since they've actually done that in the past   which i've actually reviewed you're probably  seeing something up on your screen here right now   that was a lot of fun to check out and they can  easily swap out the italian sausage for the beyond   meat so i'd love to see a version with that down  the road but very tasty guys very tasty so far wow very very good okay let's grab one  of these breadsticks real fast here   lovely situation nicely dusted olive oil action   and of course the parmesan goodness right  there they feel nice and soft let's do it tasty the fact that you're getting five of these  to go with that that's a pretty banging value i   can't stop saying it that's actually pretty good  i mean an order of breadsticks alone is probably   about half of that about four or five bucks  that's not bad and you're getting all this   pasta to go with pretty good yeah definitely  pretty good let's go for one more on this very very tasty but as good as that is  we're not here for the bread sticks i'm   here to protect my hands am i going in further  with this but guys so tasty on this this is   really really good i gotta say i'm totally  digging this combination and as i'm diving   into this further i'm thinking about the tuscani  versions that i reviewed back in the day i did a   couple of those which you'll probably see that  playlist jumping up on your screen here right   now along with a couple of screenshots of them  my thumbnails but guys as good as those were   this is actually a better combination because  i like the fact that the pepperoni is mixed   in with that italian sausage with this one maybe  adding a little bit of beef to it on top of it as   well would have been good but i see their  keeping with the italian meats theme but still   guys a very nice combination and definitely a  nice little change of pace compared to the pizza   situation that they have here very nice in terms  of the portion size it's really solid and i have   to say overall that combination of the al dente  penne with that sauce and those meats together is   a lethal combination with the cheese of course the  lovely situation let's go for another couple on it man i am totally digging this there is so much  cheese on this it is really really nice really   nice let me grab one more with the sausage  here because i think you get the point by now   the value is high on this the flavor  is pretty tasty it's very hearty   easily something for two people or one very hungry  type of peep themselves too this is actually very   very solid so one more bite we'll wrap up this  review with the rating coming up next but guys   a lovely situation of pizza hut goodness i have  to say the oven baked goodness is definitely   bomb on this pepperoni along with the sausage is  amazing with the cheese and the parmesan oregano   that's the wild card that really takes this one up  a notch there's a lot of seasoning on this and you   can really taste it in every bite it's pretty good  one more bite and we'll close this one out hang on yeah this one's pretty much a winner out the  gate guys and i love the fact that the pasta   is al dente so it adds that much heartiness to  it as you're biting down with this one here the   combination of the pepperoni the italian sausage  and the cheese and of course the shredded parmesan   the parmesan oregano seasoning there is a lot  to like about this one and of course you've got   those breadsticks to go with very satisfying and  very tasty easily worth the $8.99 by far so with   that said i'm gonna have to give this oven baked  italian meats pasta here at pizza hut a rock solid   10 out of 10 guys there was really nothing wrong  with that it was made extremely well it was very   fresh plenty of toppings plenty of cheese and  plenty of flavor and especially with the five   breadsticks to go with you can't tell me that was  not a banging value pretty solid across the board   and a decent quantity of that penne pasta to go  with guys it just satisfies i gotta tell you if   you're really hungry for something like this  you are totally gonna dig this there is a lot   to like about this one very tasty but hey since  choice is king you've got three other options   to go in on just in case italian meats aren't  really your thing including a veggie option   as well as a cheesy alfredo and a chicken alfredo  guys so you're definitely covered and i may have   to actually swing on back to give one of those  other ones a shot very tasty indeed especially   considering my experience with this one right now  alright so do me a quick favor drop some comments   down below let me know what you thought of the  presentation of this one compared to say maybe   the tuscani version that they've had on the menu  forever did you think this actually looked better   did you think it was a better value overall  drop those comments down
