 you already know what it is it's Ian K for peep this out reviews this time over at good old BK to take a look at a new sandwich as part of their latest promo so stay tuned because the BLT chicken Jr is up next welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty so here we go with the BLT chicken jr as part of the 3 for 3 meal here at BK featuring the sandwich fries and a drink all for 3 bucks not a bad deal at all and just so you guys know you can swap out those fries for their onion rings which I would easily recommend for ya along with side of zesty sauce it's a nice situation for sure your choice of drink is up to you obviously but for me Coke Zero the main star of the show though is gonna be this guy the BLT chicken jr. underneath the sesame seed bun let's take a look at it real quick here looks like we've got some chopped lettuce a little bit of light Mayo we've got that tomato slice in there and it looks like a couple of strips of the Hickory bacon it is and underneath that should be the chicken patty so let me kind of lift this up here to see wow that is really thin actually but as you can see crispy situation there but absolutely a very thin piece of chicken so I don't know about that but then again for three bucks look what you're getting here it is not too bad but guys that really is a little on the thin side but there you go so let's go in on that flavor to see if it delivers it's the BLT chicken jr. as part of the 3 for 3 promo here at BK let's peep out this flavor well I gotta be honest there's really no way I would ever personally review a BLT because I'm not really a fan of tomato that way but the fact that this actually has chicken thrown into the mix I don't really mind that whatsoever if anything it's gonna help me obviously and hey the fact that this variant is part of that 3 for 3 promo is still a pretty good deal because even if this isn't a hundred percent I still have those onion rings on that drink to go with and that's not bad either but guys just to give you another quick look at this one I really dig the fact that the bacon is looking really crispy on this I'm just a little worried about the thinness of that patty right there but let's not waste any more time let's see if this is gonna really deter me in any possible way because of the tomato let's see if the chicken makes the difference it's the BLT chicken jr. part of the 3 for 3 here at BK well that's a strong tomato right now oh the crispiness of the chicken is helping though and thankfully the bacon is really crispy as well but man that chicken patty is really really flat as you can see it feels like it's just a little below the value patty that you would normally get that is really really thin but as you can see all the veggies on top are really pumping on this one and I don't know if I'm really digging it because of that the tomato like I said it's a BLT I get it but that tomato is strong with this I'm going for another bite let's just keep going into it man yeah the crunchiness of that bacon and the crispness of the outer coating of the chicken itself easily are taking this one up for me right now and that's a good thing because that tomato slice is right up in my face I am NOT digging that whatsoever and granted I kind of knew what I was getting into when I got into this one but thankfully the crispiness and the overall crunchiness of the other stuff is really doing it well the light mayo believe it or not even though I'm not a fan of Mayo either is actually adding a little bit to that as well I'm doing everything I possibly kind of distract myself from the tomato slice being so strong with this but aside from that let me give you another quick look the chicken patty I wish was just a little bit thicker I know it's a value type of sandwich but that is just really really thin but if you guys are down with crunchy veggies if you guys are down with Mayo and obviously the bacon is pretty good you have a lot to look forward to with this woman because it is actually pretty tasty once you get past that tomato slice at least for me anyway let's go for another bite and we'll finish this one up after the rating but guys not too bad well there's really not too much else to say about this one you already know what it is it's a BLT with a crispy chicken patty thrown it into the mix and that's pretty much it now for the value of what you're getting here it's definitely not bad I just wish the chicken itself was just a little bit thicker as you've heard me say throughout this review the guy's not bad for three bucks especially with your choice of fries or onion rings and a drink all right so basing my rating strictly on the presentation along with the overall flavor of what I got today I'm gonna have to give the BLT chicken jr here at BK Justin okay 6.5 out of 10 guys the chicken is very very thin on this one and the overall flavor was okay on it along with the bacon but I got to be honest again that tomato was really throwing me off and granted I know it's a BLT sandwich with chicken thrown into the mix but the overall flavor of the chicken could have been just a little bit juicier maybe just a little bit thicker and thankfully you do have an option to go for a double cheeseburger aside from this but I was very curious to see how this one was gonna be overall in terms of the flavor considering the chicken especially that's considered a premium right I was hoping it was gonna be just a little bit thicker but still just okay of course now the obvious question is that this look pretty okay to you do me a quick favor drop some comments down below are you gonna be giving the 3 for 3 a shot over here at BK and if you are are you gonna go for the BLT Chicken Jr or are you gonna do that double cheeseburger drop those comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K closing out another episode of peep this out bringing you brand new content every single week here on my channel so while you stay tuned for that next review coming real soon in the meantime stay frosty here's one way to erase some tomato from your palette definitely go for some zesty sauce and an onion ring let's give it a shot real fast mmm good choice definitely alright guys I'll talk to you soon but hey real quick before you go and just in case you haven't already take a look at the last review that I
