 we'll leave it to taco bell to throw us a  curveball right in the middle of winter by   releasing two seasonal drinks that i think  belong during the summer time actually guys   that's right it's the island freeze drinks and  i've got both flavors up next so stay tuned   welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty hey guys welcome back to another one here on  the channel it's Ian K and let's just get it   started with this one right away guys we've got  the island freeze this is actually going to be   the strawberry variant and already my hand is  definitely lit up in a frosty like kind of way   guys i'm really digging this right now what  we've got here is a very beautiful situation   of strawberry freeze action basically strawberry  syrup mixed with a lot of ice and of course it's   got a little bit of that sweet tropical creamer  that's supposedly going to give it more of an   island vibe but again i'm really digging the  overall quality of what i've got here and   considering this is happy hour right now between  two and five for a dollar this is not bad let's   give this a shot guys it's the all-new island  freeze the strawberry variant let's give it a go oh yeah definitely actually you know what it's  more of the vanilla type of creamy flavor that   i'm getting with this one so i guess maybe it fits  during the winter time actually but again this   is just screaming summer to me in terms of the  presentation anyway pretty tasty let's keep going oh yeah this is definitely taking me back to  the pineapple whip freeze my all-time favorite   it's the exact same creamer definitely  sweet definitely elevated and of course   you've got the loveliness of the strawberry  action right here as well very refreshing   and again you can't really hate on it for  a dollar right now as well pretty good mmm   absolutely i love this creamer and you can  actually see it kind of gathering at the   very bottom here they gave me a lot with this  one i am really digging this right now again   the sweetness that vanilla creaminess that i'm  kind of tasting with it is really standing out   mixes very nicely with the elevated sweetness  of the strawberry as well let's keep going in oh yeah absolutely strawberry is not my all-time  favorite over here for taco bell with these   freezes but this is actually very nice because of  the combination of that creamer together in one   and again what's old is new again they've  pretty much had this flavor on the menu forever   adding a little bit of that quote-unquote  tropical creamer which is really kind of like   a vanilla creamer is really adding to this  one pretty tasty hmm yes sir yes sir indeed i'm definitely digging that the creamer is really  nice on this one okay let's jump on over to the   blue raspberry this is already winning in the  presentation department blue is my favorite color   and i'm really digging how cloud-like this one  looks guys we have a lot of the creamy goodness   here mixed around and again what you're looking  at here is a nice frosted cup of their blue   raspberry freeze filled with more of that sweet  tropical creamer blended in for good measure here   so let's give this one a shot blue raspberry and  again presentation primo definitely digging that oooh very tart very tart on this one with a  little bit of a vanilla vibe at the very end i like this one a lot more that is nice guys  really nice as you can see here plenty of that   frosted blue raspberry action of course it's all  artificial there's no fruit in this whatsoever   but it's really really nice and again with the  vanilla creamer action aka the tropical creamer   that they're saying here the sweet tropical  goodness definitely gathering on the bottom   it is really adding very nicely to this overall  this is absolutely my favorite out of the two and again a dollar on happy hour wow  that tartness is getting me really   strong in the very back here this  is really tasty let's keep going in absolutely nice and of course it's  very chilly right now in southern   cali so that's actually elevating the  fact that i'm really feeling super   frosty right now on top of it but very  tasty on this one guys very tasty indeed and again just a buck lovely action one more time close up on this one  and you know what just for good measure let's   give them both the limelight here as you can see  depending upon your flavor of choice if you're   really down with strawberry over here at taco bell  you know exactly what to expect same with the blue   raspberry but naturally on the very bottom with  all of that creamy vanilla action that i'm tasting   with this one very very tasty and again pretty  decent size i think it's about a 16 ounce for   both of these and for a dollar again you really  can't hate on it pretty pretty good overall so   with that said and just to round this one out i'm  gonna have to give these all new island freezes   depending upon your flavor overall a pretty  solid 8 out of 10 like i said they really   deliver in terms of the flavor and depending upon  your flavor of choice for me it's gonna be that   blue raspberry easily the combination of the sweet  tropical creamer aka that vanilla creamer from the   pineapple whip freeze it's actually my all-time  favorite you're definitely going to be digging   these guys the quality is pretty good and again  very familiar in terms of the flavor because these   are the standard freezers over here at taco bell  but with the addition of that sweet creamer action   definitely a bomb situation easily all right so  before it gets any colder right now do me a quick   favor drop some comments down below let me know  which is your favorite out of these two if you've   given them both a shot and which is your all-time  favorite freeze over here at taco bell i'm always   curious to see exactly what you actually prefer  out of every single one that they've had drop   those comments down below
