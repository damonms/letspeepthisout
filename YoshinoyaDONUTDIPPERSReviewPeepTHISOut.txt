 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty it's another high quality foodie feature for you with Ian K here on peep this out reviews this time over at yoshinoya because it looks like they're getting into the donut biz for a little while guys feast your eyes on their all-new donut dippers essentially their version of donut holes served with a side of caramel dipping sauce and i gotta say this is looking pretty good $2.19 is what the cost is for these and each of them about $0.37 a piece size wise they are definitely not bad for that price point nice texture a little bit of the squishy side a little bit of the firm side definitely looking pretty good and obviously with that caramel dipping sauce you know that's going to be a lovely situation with donut holes i'm thinking it's going to be pretty delicious so let's not waste any more time on this one let's see if yoshinoya can bring their A-Game with their all-new donut dippers we're definitely going to peep this out and peep this out we shall let me just say i'm really digging the presentation of these guys they look really cool on the inside of this little container and you can really smell that fried goodness they definitely look pretty decent and like i said the size of these not too bad $0.37 a piece roughly $2.19 for a 6-piece not bad with that caramel sauce but a lovely situation and again as you guys can see the perspective there not bad for what this is i mean there's no dusting of cinnamon sugar they're pretty much just straight donut holes but they are looking and smelling pretty fantastic okay

forget to tap that bell icon so you can be notified as soon as brand new content drops every week guys these are nice and moist on my fingers as i'm holding this right now greasy goodness for sure let's give it a shot it's the all new donut dippers here at yoshinoya oh yeah very oily but nice cakey too on the inside that's pretty good yeah definitely nice and cakey and rich on this one guys take a look on the inside here very very dense and cakey like i said you're going to hear that throughout this review it's very pasty you're going to want to make sure you have a drink with these for sure but i'm really digging the overall texture so they do feel light and airy on the outside the crispiness is definitely nice on these but the inside is super super dense but very oily in a very good way this is pretty good man that is super super rich and dense i can't say it enough and thankfully we've got something to dip these into right now and i'm actually kind of glad too because i want to see what the flavor is going to be like overall see if we can get this one focused for you there we've got that caramel dipping sauce action fairly thick looking really really nice let's give it a shot with this real fast wow that's almost a mapley type of caramel flavor but again that dense cakiness on the inside these are small but they're packed with flavor man i really wish i had something to drink right now this is really really strong but with the caramel a lovely situation guys they give you a fairly decent amount on the inside here and a little goes a long way you don't really need to get crazy with this but for you caramel peeps out there you are definitely going to dig this this is actually good yeah good call on the dipping sauce with this even chocolate would have been amazing i'm sure but caramel a nice compliment to the oiliness of the donut holes and i gotta say again the texture is banging on this one it feels very oily on the fingers these are super fresh but when you dip this into the caramel it kind of neutralizes that just a little bit as you're biting into this you're not getting so much of that oil but the caramel comes through but then it feels nice and buttery because of that feeling and again it's all the oils and the caramel together the sweetness kind of decadent guys kind of decadent indeed man that oil is really strong and dense i like it but this is not what i expected i didn't expect them to be this cakey on the inside but these are really really good look at that little bubble on the very top right there guys that's not caramel that is oil and i gotta say i am loving it this is really good once you squeeze into this a little bit you can kind of see i don't know if i can kind of make that happen for you there but it is definitely wet really really look at that on the very top right there it is really really tasty so easy recommendation if you guys like donuts if you like donut holes a little goes a long way a little bit of the sauce that you're getting from the caramel but the nice denseness and the crispiness on the outside and the airiness initially once you start chewing into it it's very very thick and it really sticks to the back of your mouth this is really good though it really is so one more bite of this one i'll close it out after the rating naturally but guys this is absolutely worth your time if you're a donut lover like i am not so much donut holes for me personally but i like these so far and especially with that caramel sauce you have a lot to look forward to it is pretty good one more bite and we'll finish it out man this caramel sauce is the bomb all right so don't let the appearance fool you they may look nice and area on the outside and while initially they may feel like that as you're biting down into it you're gonna know right away you've got a lot of pasty cakey goodness to look forward to with this one they're very dense very rich and easily worth that $0.37 a piece guys with that sauce it is really a very lovely situation with these a nice first effort from yoshinoya right out the gate with this one but i'd love to see some chocolate sauce to go with this one in the future these are definitely tasty all right so like i said earlier i'm definitely a donut person for sure most of you guys who watch my channel know that already but when it comes to donut holes not so much and i got to be honest for me to like these as much as i do right now especially with that caramel dipping sauce that says a lot the quality is very very high the oiliness is on point it's what you'd expect when you bite into a donut hole like that especially when it's so cakey but again i really didn't know what to expect since it's my first time trying these i didn't know if they were going to be kind of hollow in the inside that's what i initially thought i mean i did check out the del taco version of these a while back i think it was like 4 for a dollar back then i'll have that review popping up on your screen right now so you can check it out these easily blow those away by far the quality is so much better on these and again that caramel dipping sauce very awesome very awesome indeed so with that said and i think you know what's coming i'm gonna have to give the donut dippers over here at yoshinoya especially with that caramel dipping sauce a rock solid 10 out of 10 like i said this one delivered across the board and easily converted me to want to get something like this a little bit more often being that i'm not a donut hole type of person so guys that says something right there for me definitely and i got to say the quality top-notch delicious stuff okay now the obvious question did this look pretty delicious to you right now do me a quick favor drop
