expected cheesiness on the inside this is looking  pretty great so what we've got here is a large   one-topping pizza with my all-time favorite  topping of course it's going to be sausage   we've got plenty of cheese to go with and of  course that's sitting along with our signature   marinara sauce right there underneath it and i  gotta say it looks and smells pretty fantastic   on the inside of that crust and hence the name the  epic stuffed crust we've got plenty of mozzarella   cheese it looks like guys this obviously stretches  around the whole ring of this pizza and it's   looking pretty great already here and for dipping  we've got their special garlic dipping sauce   their signature which i can't wait to get into as  well so let's not waste any more time on this one   this is the all-new epic stuffed crust pizza  here at papa john's let's peep out this flavor   well this is already winning because it's pizza  guys and i have to admit the smell is glorious   in my car right now but when you add stuffed  crust action into it that is always going to   be a favorite and the fact that this is epic  on top of it i'm expecting a lot of cheesy   goodness with this i'm sure this is going to  be pretty fantastic how could it not right   all right so let's get ourselves outfitted for  battle here let me pull up a slice and wow this   is already pretty hefty here let me just show  this to you real fast take a look on the inside   there is the cheesy goodness going  around here guys this is looking   really really nice there is a solid amount  and again that crust is nice and thick this   is looking pretty great here of course the sausage  goodness that we have right there on the top let   me go for a quick bite of this real fast and  then we'll obviously get into the crust but   let's just do it guys it's the epic stuffed  crust pizza here at papa john's let's do it the classic spices on the sausage itself  is a beautiful situation the combination   of the cheese and of course their signature  marinara it really is a very lovely situation   you can go with any toppings with this but  for one topping just choose whatever you'd   like with it but naturally for me it's got  to be sausage but guys take a look at that   there that is just looking really nice on  the inside let's go for a fast bite of this   the epic stuffed crust you know what let me see  if i can try and squeeze this out towards you   it's a little bit more congealed together  yeah pretty much congeal but let's just go   for a quick bite this is hearty like i said  it's very hefty and very heavy let's do it thick thick cheese man banging come on you know  it's going to be it's doughy it's glutinous i mean   guys come on it's just plenty of cheese on the  back of the crust and depending upon how you   feel about how you want to start off with eating a  stuffed crust pizza should you actually start with   the crust and go for the cheese or make that like  the treasure trove when you get to the very back   after eating the front your mileage may vary  i like to go back and forth between but still   guys a very lovely situation let me go for a quick  bite in the front and then i'll give you some more   glory shots of this pizza as we go but guys very  very delicious stuff so far let's keep going in so obviously you already know sausage is my  favorite topping for pizza and actually it   goes amazing with all the cheese here and when you  get to the very back let me take you further on in   here as you can see a very lovely situation with  that ring of cheese going around and it really   is a very nice amount it's a little bit more  congealed together as you can see but once you   bite into it it is very thick and you can really  taste that mozzarella it's a beautiful situation   of course if you go for a quick bite of  the pizza in the front you're going to   get that much more cheesy goodness and  depending upon your topping of choice   you're going to really dig this one guys because  like i said it's stuffed crust how bad could this   really be when you have an over abundance of  cheese to go with and a nice toastiness coming   from the crust itself just a lovely situation yeah  definitely a lovely situation you know what's also   up there with it watching this get made there's  actually something so satisfying by seeing that   dough spread out onto the pan and kind of get  prepared for what's about to happen here guys   it was really really cool to watch and as you're  seeing in these clips here right now the dough is   actually placed into a special type of pan ring  that they actually use to place the mozzarella   sticks around the edge of the crust before folding  it over they stretch all the way around from there   a nice portion of their signature pizza sauce  is applied and then spread out all throughout   before your topping of choice is put on and then  naturally plenty of cheese on the very top and   they use a very solid amount as they should and  then lastly you know what comes next this thing   is popped into the oven where as you can see  it pops out on the other side in a nice gooey   gooey delicious looking fashion guys and a very  lovely situation indeed before it's boxed up so   loveliness all around and speaking of loveliness  all around you already know what it is it's papa   john's so guys it's all about the garlic dipping  sauce action let's get into this right now and i'm   going right for it with that crust there we're  gonna lather this one up with the good stuff   as you guys can see there a lovely situation we've  got plenty of that cheese in the back of the crust   and of course the garlic dipping sauce to go  with let's hit it the smell is so strong on   top of the toastiness of my car right now and  the cheese that i'm getting guys here we go   the butteriness right away oh man this  is so decadently delicious right now man   it's always game over when it comes to  this garlic sauce guys it is a beautiful   situation and there's a good solid shot  of the cheese on the inside as you can   see it's beginning to cool just a bit but  you can see the thickness of what's in here   so naturally with the doughiness of the crust  and your topping of choice and everything else   just a lovely situation and again with that garlic  action on this it is basically just like really   thick margarine with heavy garlic guys it's really  really delicious stuff let's just keep going in man it pairs so beautifully with the thickness of  everything here man i can't i got to keep going guys   let's just keep doing this here let's go for a  little bit of the pizza itself and as you can see   another lovely situation here we go with  the italian sausage and cheese let's do it i'm loving this we are so gonna kill  the slice here right now because why   not i'm just gonna keep showing it to  you the garlic sauce action here we go i'm telling you doesn't matter which way you  begin it all ends in a beautiful situation man   all right last bite here we go this is actually  loaded with the cheese right there guys let's go   for another last dip on this one let's coat it why  not on both sides with the exception of the back   as you can see plenty of epic goodness guys this  epic stuff crust is no joke a delicious amount   of cheesy goodness on the inside and it's super  flavorful and of course it pairs beautifully with   the garlic sauce here we go well as my boy hudson  says in aliens game over man game over this   is absolutely a game over situation just because  of the size of the crust alone especially with all   the goodness on the inside guys that's the one-two  punch that really delivers on this one it's a very   solid amount of cheesy goodness to go with and of  course depending upon your topping to go with the   sausage is really tasty over here at papa john's  it really goes very nicely on all of their stuff   naturally with the cheese the signature sauce  a lovely situation and with the crust itself   it is nicely toasted guys even on the bottom it  is not too bad as well it's got a little bit of   flop to it still but which is a nice situation  in general but guys it's all about the epicness   on the inside and this one absolutely delivers  that in spades in the cheese and the size of the   crust itself very lovely better ingredients better  pizza papa john's so with that said i'm going to   have to give the all-new epic stuffed crust pizza  here at papa john's a rock solid 9 out of 10 now   at the end of the day this is still a very rock  solid pizza on its own guys for me personally   i'm definitely a fan of papa john's and i love  what they actually have to offer with this one   especially with the size of the crust being what  it is it's super toasty in the back and i gotta   say the cheese on the inside a lovely situation  one word of advice though make sure you get   right to it as soon as you get to it because  everything kind of begins to congeal together   and although it's still very flavorful very  tasty some of your pull may vary but even still   very dense when you bite into that you're gonna  taste it so the epic name is absolutely warranted   and hey let's not forget about that garlic dipping  sauce i mean once you pair these two together   that's literally when this bomb deliciousness  becomes like a whole brand new experience for   you guys i mean as it should the garlic dipping  sauce is amazing over here at papa john's and   it's no exception on the epic stuffed crust it's  really warranted thank god it comes in the box let   me tell you all right so before i grab another  slice of this awesomeness off camera here right   now do me a quick favor drop some
