 welcome to peep this out reviews  with Ian K stay frosty happy early halloween everyone and welcome to the  channel where today I'm over at good old Mickey   D's to check out the return of a true classic  Happy Meal that hasn't been seen in a very   very long time and it's coincidentally  back for Halloween for obvious reasons   that's right guys and as you already know it's  the return of the Halloween Happy Meal pails and   I gotta say I am so glad to finally give one  of these a shot guys this looks really really   cool what you're looking at here is the mcboo  variant and I gotta say this is really really   slick and the presentation is pretty cool on  what this is let's break this on down real quick   yes sir this is totally taking me back to the  80s guys a very cool looking Happy Meal here and   as you can see it is dressed up very nicely for  Halloween so basically what you're looking at   here is essentially that it's a Halloween happy  meal with your choice of hamburger in this case   that's what I went with or chicken McNuggets a  four or six piece not too bad there you've then   got your choice of either apple slices or fries  and obviously I chose fries but I think I got   an extra one thrown into this pail comment down  below and let me know if you're supposed to get   actually one or two of these it's my first time  giving this Happy Meal a shot so naturally Two   Is Better Than One I'll take it for the drink  you do have a few choices ranging from water   to juice to milk that type of thing but I opted  for a good old Diet Coke a very small child size   obviously very nice and all that is included  inside the main star of the show the Halloween   Happy Meal pail itself and in this case it's the  mcboo variant that's the only one my location has   but you do have two other choices that include  the mcpunkin as well as the mcgoblin so guys   a very cool combination of goodies that you  can get with this one for the Halloween season   and naturally with this being a Happy Meal you  of course get something thrown into the box extra   and in this case it's not a toy It's actually an  activity sheet where you get a bunch of stickers   that you can use to dress up the skeleton costumes  in the very back of this one here so very cool for   what this is although I do have to admit I would  have liked to have gotten a Halloween collectible   kind of like the cactus plant flea market box that  came out not that long ago but still guys this is   pretty cool for the kids and it does look pretty  fun so there you go it's the hamburger variant   of the returning Halloween Happy Meal Pals  here at McDonald's let's peep out this flavor   yeah yeah I know what you're probably thinking why  would you want to peep out the flavor for just a   basic hamburger and fries that comes with this  right I mean chances are you probably had that a   million times you've probably seen that a million  times but honestly I have never had a Happy Meal   like literally in so many years I thought it would  be kind of fun and considering with the sticker   pack this comes with here this is actually kind of  cool but again it doesn't really hold a candle to   the coolness that I thought this one was here  that limited edition cactus plant flea market   goodness very very cool and while I do wish I  caught like a toy or something on the inside   of this for the Halloween season this is actually  kind of neat so let me go for a quick little bite   just to give this a go this is probably going  to be the one and only time you're going to   see me take a bite or at least review somewhat the  regular hamburger here at McDonald's but guys look   how small this is this is crazy I mean it's meant  for kids right let's just go into this real quick beefy McDonald's flavor ketchup mustard pickle  action not bad admittedly the burger is   a little on the dry side but it does have that  familiar flavor from Mickey D's along with the   pickle naturally the Ketchup the mustard it's as  basic as you can get but it's just all right for   what it is naturally the chicken McNuggets I think  would have been the better way to go being that I   love those but hey wanted to do something a little  bit different with this one and as for the fries   real quick I mean guys two of these on the inside  are you supposed to get two I mean hopefully you   guys are dropping those comments down below I  didn't expect to actually get more than one but   guys this is a little bit of a joke I understand  for a kid and all but considering the size of this   in my hand this is very very tiny but it does  have that Timeless flavor of the french fries   naturally on the inside as you guys already know  my focus needs Focus it's all good you guys have   seen a fry before a million times let's just knock  it out tasty again familiar flavor from Mickey D's   definitely digging that and of course the  child size soft drink right over here Diet Coke is banging all right let's take a look  at this really quick again I am totally digging   the faces that this actually has I thought these  were like a bunch of different versions you'd   have to kind of collect but I see where they're  going for here this looks really really slick I'm   totally digging how super fun this looks because  it's got a Whimsical type of flair to it on top   of just being for the Halloween season so I like  that and one more time just to show you here the   little activity sheet very cool you've got some  stickers and everything there and you simply place   them on the very back so for the kiddies this is  actually very very cool and again I kind of keep   coming back to it I really wish there was a toy  or something on the inside but this is kind of   cool it's kind of fun for what it is but mcboo  and naturally again you have mcpunkin and you   have the mcgoblin available for this one as well  very very cool for five bucks about $4.69 that's not   a bad deal considering I guess if there was a toy  in here it'd be like a dollar or two more anyway   I still think that would have been pretty decent  but it's super fun great to see The Return of a   classic especially for the season guys very very  fun indeed all right so as for the rating I think   I'm just going to go with the concept of what this  is naturally so overall I think an 8 out of 10 is   perfectly fine your mileage may vary for the type  of food you want to get for the Happy Meal whether   it's the chicken McNuggets the four or six piece  or the burger it's fine for what it is but guys   this is the main draw because naturally with  the kiddies you have a little trick-or-treat   pail to go with and that's really the cool thing  and I think it really kind of shows a little bit   of personality around the very back here so  really really slicking again it's the return   of a classic after so many years what's old is  new again and obviously everyone's going to be   looking for these pails especially the other two  naturally but very cool and I'm definitely glad   to have given this one a shot it was a lot of fun  to film this right now all right so do me a quick   favor drop some comments down below how excited  are you to have the Halloween Happy Meal pails   back on the menu over here for a limited time only  naturally through Halloween I mean have you been   counting down the days ever since they announced  this was coming back it's the worst kept secret on   the internet for like the last month drop some  comments down
