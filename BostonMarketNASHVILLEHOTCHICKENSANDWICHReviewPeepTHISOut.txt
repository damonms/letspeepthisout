 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty hey everyone welcome back to another high quality  foodie feature for you here on the channel   cheaters cam style after hours over at boston  market because it looks like nashville hot has   finally landed on the menu and to help celebrate  we've got one heated looking sandwich to go in on   so let's do just that as we go in and they're  all new nashville hot chicken sandwich and i'm   already digging the size of this brioche bun  guys as you can see it is sizeable for sure   and nice and shiny let's take a look underneath  it looks like a solid portion of their nashville   hot sauce which actually features cayenne  pepper chili powder with sugar garlic and   some secret spices and it's looking nice and  dark and as you can see to complement that   we've got four pickles around there as well and it  looks like we've got some ranch sauce to go with   it so that should definitely help balance out  some of the heat that i'm thinking we're gonna   get from the nashville hot sauce but focusing  on the chicken looks like we've got a nicely   breaded piece of breast meat here guys this is  looking pretty nice and while it's not super thick   it's definitely wide enough to cover the whole  bun and that's definitely a good situation   underneath that looks like we've got a little  bit more of that ranch sauce but i gotta say the   presentation is pretty awesome on this guys it's  sizeable even though like i said it's not tall   it's wide and it definitely looks to satisfy and  coming back to the pickles real fast i am really   digging the overall appearance of these guys  they're not super thin they're not super thick   they look to complement what's here and overall  the presentation really does look to satisfy   considering this is like $8.29 of course it's a  premium price point the size of it is pretty   sizable like i said the size is pretty sizable  it is because it's fairly wide all right let's   dive into this one it's the all-new nashville hot  chicken sandwich here at boston market let's do it all right first off it's boston market so you  already know the chicken's gonna be juicy   and as my mouth is beginning to water like  crazy right now the heat coming from that   nashville hot sauce is very very solid it's  beginning to elevate as i'm talking further   and i gotta say guys i'm really glad  the ranch sauce is on this right now   because it's really kind of helping to  balance that coolness with the heat together   nice combination let's go for another  bite my mouth is crazy watering here we go mmm that's good well you really can't have  nashville hot chicken without pickles as   far as i'm concerned so i'm really digging the  fact that they're on here right now the flavor   of the pickles alone is adding so much to this  on top of the light breading believe it or not   and as you can see there is a huge amount of white  meat so i'm really digging the fact that it's not   overly breaded overly fried you can really taste  everything very nicely and i would expect nothing   less coming from a place that specializes in  rotisserie chicken so the juiciness is awesome   on this and again the nashville hot has got a nice  little sting to go with it's not overbearing but   it really is super flavorful you know coming back  to that ranch dressing real quick and me being a   fan of it anyway i was definitely excited to  try the mixture of ranch and nashville hot   because i've never really done that so that's  actually a very nice combination for me i'm   really digging it and i like the fact that it's  really helping again to counterbalance the heat   with some coolness right there so the flavor is  nice and again the sizeability i should say of   the sandwich it's decent guys i mean like i said  it's close to the 10 range but what you're getting   here is a fairly sizable sandwich because it's  wide but i'm digging it guys let's keep going in you know i know it's 2021 but even still there  are so many more chicken sandwiches coming out   on the market right now so the fact that we have  a new entry into the chicken sandwich wars from   boston market it's a beautiful situation because  like i said they specialize in rotisserie chicken   so you expect this to be pretty decent and i gotta  admit it really is so the premium price point like   i said is up there but the quality is pretty  banging and speaking of quality with the quality   of that nashville hot sauce in this whatever  those secret spices are to go with i'm really   digging the fact that it's not overly breaded so  you're not getting a lot of breading with this but   you're really able to taste that sauce beautifully  with it and again the solidness of that white meat   as you can see is just a beautiful situation  guys again i just wish there was just a few more   pickles on it but that's it yeah pretty delicious  stuff and it's made even more delicious by having   this late night right now here on the cheaters cam  edition to peep this out reviews pretty banging on   the sandwich guys let's go for one more bite  we'll finish this one up after the rating but   i think you know it's gonna be rated highly right  considering the price point still it's worth your   time hang on one second all right so let's go  a little convertible for this final shot here   and as you can see a very nice piece of fried  chicken done the boston market way guys and again   those pickles are adding so much to this that  combination of the nashville hot and the pickle   goes amazing with this there and again the light  breading that you're getting around the chicken   itself allows you to taste more of that white  meat along with the sauce and it really is a nice   combination including the softness of the brioche  bun this has just done very very well and again i   only wish i had a few more of those pickles to go  on the sandwich considering the size of it maybe   one or two extra would have been perfect along  with maybe a little bit more ranch but other   than that a very well done chicken sandwich  and like i said while it wasn't super thick   the flavor was pretty awesome and considering how  wide it is it is sizeable when you're diving into   it so with that said i'm gonna have to give the  all-new nashville hot chicken sandwich here at   boston market a pretty rock solid 8.5  out of 10 and i really can't go much higher than   that considering the price point i mean it  really is a premium anything over four bucks   you really gotta bring it and considering  the quality of boston market in general   it is delicious but you're gonna  pay that premium believe it or not   considering the size of it that's what really  kind of helps the score just a little bit as well   but overall the price needs to come down just  maybe a couple of bucks and then you've got   something pretty amazing i think but as it stands  this is still a delicious chicken sandwich and i'd   easily recommend it to you if you've got boston  market in the area definitely give this one a   shot especially if you like heat you're gonna like  this all right talk about a segue right are you   gonna be giving this one a shot drop some comments  down below let me know if you're gonna be giving   this one a go and if you're a fan of nashville  hot who do you
