 hey everyone welcome back to another high quality  foodie feature for you here on the channel   cheaters cam style after hours over a good old  jack in the box because it looks like they've   got some brand new cheddar biscuit action going on  so stay tuned because the chicken variants up next   welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty so here we go with the all-new chicken cheddar  biscuit breakfast sandwich here at jack and   already the appearance is looking pretty inviting  on this guys a pretty thick piece of chicken is   on this one for sure but what's really getting me  is the buttery aroma and that's definitely coming   from the biscuit so speaking of the biscuit let's  break this one down from top to bottom and what   we've got here is real cheddar cheese baked right  into this biscuit hence the cheddar biscuit name   but guys it's really really crumbly and i have  to admit sticking to the cheese as you're going   to see here i definitely can't pop the top on it  very easily but what you're going to find is what   that cheese is stuck to is a very nice looking  fried egg actually a lovely situation there   cheese and eggs and a buttery biscuit come on it's  already a winning combination but when it's on top   of a 100% white meat crispy chicken patty that's  pretty sizable i'm definitely down with it this   is looking pretty fantastic already underneath it  nothing is there except the other bottom of the   cheddar biscuit itself but i gotta say guys a very  nice presentation on this one and the aroma like i   said super buttery in the car right now so let's  hopefully confirm the awesome flavor on this one   it's the all-new chicken cheddar biscuit breakfast  sandwich here with jack let's peep out this flavor   yeah it's definitely feeling pretty crumbly  but as you can see from this perspective look   at the size of the chicken guys that  is a lovely situation right there and   that cheddar biscuit you can kind of see  some of those toasted edges on the bottom   a little bit on the top but i have to  admit this already has me with the egg   and the cheese melted on it they're pretty  fantastic and like i said super buttery in   the car right now the aroma is strong all right  let's not waste any more time on this one one   last time it's the chicken cheddar biscuit  breakfast sandwich here at jack let's do it oh come on whoa all right now i gotta be honest  like i always am but guys i think this is gonna   be the first time i'm gonna say this on camera  this straight out tastes like death in my hands   here right now it is so buttery rich the cheddar  cheese flavor from the biscuit is extremely strong   it dovetails right into the eggs and then right  into the crispiness of the chicken let me just   show it to you before i take another bite here  guys the biscuit is banging on this one this   is a super delicious buttery biscuit and right  when i bit into it you can taste a lot of that   buttery goodness right away you almost feel like  it's gluttonous as you go into this but guys the   flavor is crazy let's go for another bite and i'll  give you another close-up but guys again death in   my hand but what a way to go right i mean super  buttery and super delicious hang on mmm man you   know i have to say as delicious as this is right  now it's super fun to do this late at night guys   because the good thing about jack is they've got  breakfast all day so you can get this any time of   the day or night and i have to admit i am loving  this right now the buttermilk action on this   biscuit it's definitely tasting like that very  wholesome very rich very thick has a beautiful   buttery sensation and then you have really  really strong cheddar flavor on this one going   into the chicken and the egg and the cheese just  ridiculousness all around and on the real after   taking just a couple of bites of this right now  i can't wait to jump on over to rdr food reviews   to see his thoughts on this because i saw him pop  up on my feed with him checking this out as well   take a look at the link in the description down  below and head on over to rdr food reviews let   him know that Ian K sent you and definitely tell  him the chicken variant is banging already guys i   can't wait to see what he has to say i think it  was a couple of the breakfast sandwiches he may   have done but i had a feeling this was going to  be coming my way i didn't want to look at anything   until this was finished and guys i am so glad  to give this one a shot because the chicken is   ridiculous let's go for another couple more bites  in this one very delicious guys very delicious it's just so thick you know what i'm really  digging about this aside from the buttery tasty   goodness of that cheddar biscuit itself and just  the overall cheddar flavor of it is the fact that   it's not a cheap chicken patty thrown into this  just to kind of make something brand new aside   from the breakfast variants this is actually  a very thick piece of chicken 100% white meat   and honestly at first glance when i kind of saw  this i was like is this kind of like the mcchicken   biscuit at mcdonald's guys it's nothing like that  whatsoever and the flavor on it is definitely up   there i mean the cheese the butteriness the egg  that fried egg is making a huge difference on top   of everything else here but the butteriness of the  biscuit the cheddar biscuit itself is ridiculous   this is perfect for breakfast food and i have to  say guys very gluttonous very gluttonous indeed   and with that said and as most of you guys  probably know i'm not a super fan of getting   up really early in the morning to do breakfast  reviews i mean i have a few here on the channel   naturally but honestly with something like this  i'm so glad you can get it 24/7 practically   this really is the way to go and honestly  with everything that i'm tasting right now   the flavor is just off the chart guys  the chicken patty itself like i said   super juicy just the right amount of crispiness  the thickness is pretty awesome on it and it goes   amazingly well with the egg and that slice  of american cheese but guys the butteriness   and the overall cheddar flavor of the biscuit  if this cheese really wasn't on there i really   wouldn't mind it as much because it is so  dense and rich and buttery on the biscuit   itself along with the egg and then of course  the chicken it's really just kind of the glue   to kind of keep things together so the biscuit is  a little on the crumbly side but honestly i think   that's where the cheese comes in that it really  kind of helps keep it together because guys   it is loaded with the good stuff and like i  said death in your hand every once in a while   on something like this pretty delicious all right  so let's go for one more bite we'll close this one   up after the rating i think you know where i'm  going with it guys this is super fun to check   out at night and let me just say the chicken patty  elevates this to crazy levels right now in flavor   on top of the amazing flavor of the cheddar  biscuit itself one more bite we'll close it up all right let me try and go around the world  for you as carefully as i can because this is   beginning to fall apart but guys all day long  with this one all night long with this one the   flavor is amazing on it definitely a beautiful  combination of all the flavors together and with   the egg the cheese and of course that real  cheddar on the biscuit a lovely situation   an easy recommendation from jack in the box  easily order on ubereats postmates and grubhub   so with that said i'm gonna have to give the  all new chicken cheddar biscuit breakfast   sandwich here jack in the box a rock solid  9 out of 10 and the only reason it's not the   perfect 10 out of 10 is the price point here  on the west coast $4.65 is just a little bit   of a bigger pill to swallow for this one  thankfully the quality delivers guys like   i said it's really there you really get the  denseness of the biscuit the overall flavor   of the cheddar is there the butteriness of  everything together and of course the egg   the combination works extremely well $3.99 i think  is a better price point to go with considering the   other guys out there with chicken sandwiches now  while this is not the same exact type of thing   it's definitely in the same type of vein and  considering the price point i think $3.99 is   really perfect for something like that you can get  the 2 for $5 right now which is kind of cool   there's a bacon variant and a sausage variant  available that actually is a very great value   considering what it is the chicken you're gonna  pay the premium for but guys it is super delicious   i just wish the price was just a little bit less  but still awesome all right question time for you   what did you personally think of this one right  now if you've got a jack in the box in the area   how interested are you in these cheddar biscuits  i mean they are pretty flavorful guys like i said   the butteriness is off the chart and the flavor  of the cheddar is pretty banging but out of the   ones that are offered currently here right  now with the chicken variant that i just did   aside from maybe the bacon and the sausage which  one are you personally looking forward to the most   drop those comments down below and definitely let  me know and with that this is Ian K closing out   another high quality foodie feature for you here  on peep this out reviews cheaters cam style after   hours bringing you brand new content every single  week here on my channel so while you stay tuned for that   next review coming real soon in the meantime stay  frosty you know i gotta say these cheddar biscuits   are a real game changer over here at jack in the  box they should really consider keeping this on   the menu permanently because this really isn't  offered anywhere else as something as a breakfast   variant that you can get 24/7 practically jack  come on keep this on the menu it's delicious   all right guys until next time i'll talk to
