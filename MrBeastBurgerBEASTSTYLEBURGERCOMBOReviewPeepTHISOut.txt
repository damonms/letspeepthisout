 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty hey everyone welcome back to another high quality  foodie feature for you here on the channel   all right let's just get right to it because  you obviously know what's coming guys one of   the biggest youtube content creators on the planet  if not one of the biggest philanthropists on the   planet as well just launched 300 brand new fast  casual burger joints across the country and guess   what i've got one of them about three miles from  my place right now so you better believe we're   gonna check this out and check it out we shall  guys feast your eyes on the mr beast burger beast   style combo and i gotta say i am really digging  this already guys i really love the marketing   already with this this is looking really really  cool so let's start off with the star of the   show the mr beast burger beast style and as you can see the bun itself is a little on the flat side   but admittedly it is nice and soft let's take  a look underneath it looks like a little bit of   that ketchup and that deli style brown mustard  is kind of soaked into it there but not bad   as for the main protein it looks like we've got  two smashed crisp beef patties guys and admittedly   they do look nice and charred two pieces of cheese  looks like it's separating between both of them   here and again a nice charred action going around  those edges and i think that should dovetail   nicely with the house seasoning it's supposed to  have and underneath it looks like we've got the   rest of the stuff coming up on the back end here  we got a little bit of mayo we've got some pickles   we've got some diced white onion and again the  smell on my car i gotta admit kind of smells like   smash burger believe it or not but the pickles  i have to admit i am definitely digging those   nice thick cut on that but guys it's all about  the flavor on this one before we jump into this   let's take a look at the fries feast your eyes  on the mr beast fries seasoned action and i'm   getting kind of an italian seasoning vibe with  these crinkle cut they do look pretty nice decent   size not too many in the bag but again i am really  digging the presentation so let's not waste any   more time on this one it's the mr beast burger beast style combo newly launched at mr beast burger here   in pasadena california let's peep out this flavor  yeah it's all about the beast style i'm definitely   digging the marketing with this so far very very  slick absolutely and again the burger i gotta   admit again too it's very smash burger-esque it  really is reminding me that the smell is very   familiar and i guess with those smash patties  they're kind of emulating that there but again   nice cheesy goodness you can see the pickle action  right there a nice soft bun and guys before i   even get into this just so you know i'm super  impressed to know that the sale of every one of   these actually has a portion going towards feeding  hungry families across the country right now and   considering what we're all going through that is  a beautiful situation and again it just shows the   type of character that mr beast has got going  on guys it is really really an awesome thing so   let's give this a shot one more look at this one  here as i'm losing some diced onions in the back   let's give this a shot it's the mr beast burger  beast style named after him of course let's do it smash burger wow that's nice the caramelized salty  edges around this burger are off the chart guys   that is absolutely delicious it's not the  juiciest burger but the most flavor is coming   from everything around this here those edges the  quality of the beef are solid i haven't even got   to the pickles just yet but still banging  let's keep going this is pretty awesome   there's something about a burger like this  it's not trying to be the prettiest burger   out there but the flavor that it's delivering  is off the chart and that soft bun i gotta say   again is doing a very nice job holding it together  admittedly it's a little on the smashed side as you   can see no pun intended to smash burger but again  nice quality guys this is just a very very tasty   slightly overly salty type of beef that this  has got but the flavor is amazing and the diced   onions that i'm getting also very nice situation  an additional crunch that it's adding the pickle   even the mayo i'm not really tasting too much  because everything is kind of soaked into it   but it's kind of a gluttonously tasty cheeseburger  guys really really tasty let's keep going let's keep going in with the close-ups  because you can never get too much of   this stuff here and as you can see nice  beefy goodness guys and again with those   diced onions on the bottom it's a  nice combination believe it or not   i am not tasting any ketchup or mustard because  of how strong the flavor is on the beef and the   cheese and honestly i'm okay with that because  everything else is lighting up on this one   beautifully one more bite we'll get into some  fries in just a second this is really really good side note before we get into those fries  this actually took me about 45 minutes to   get you can only get this through postmates  grubhub you know doordash any of those type   of delivery services and believe me they  got a pretty cool menu here aside from the   different variations of burgers that you'll  most likely see on the channel here you've   got chicken sandwich variations as well as  a little bit of dessert action thrown into   the mix and as well as some type of loaded  fries or beast style fries as they call them   some pretty cool things to look forward to  but hey speaking of beast style fries because   these are not those these are just their seasoned  fries here wow this is a little bit of a flopper   i just picked up a flopper but look at the size  of this here take a look crinkle cut action let   me try and keep that focused for you it's got  like italian seasoning but i really like the   crispiness of that so definitely nice texture on  this one as well let me just try this real fast it's okay it really feels like  italian seasoning to be honest   a little bit of kick though  a little spiciness actually but the quality of the fry is actually  pretty good guys take a look at that on   the inside very potatoey a little bit on the  creamier side light crunch on the outside   with the actual italian spicing and the seasoning  on that so not bad for what this is and again part   of the combo comes with it really good and hey  speaking of combos of course you can upgrade the   options on this combo itself you can actually do  a triple patty version and honestly i almost did   that for the inaugural review of mr beast here  on the channel but i thought you know what let's   just go with the straight double that's how it  comes standard obviously what i think he prefers   and honestly guys i think it works anything  over that would be just an over abundance   of beef which is fine because the quality is  decent but i am really digging what this is   guys like i said very reminiscent of smash  burger and honestly the flavor is just   on point the pickles everything else this  has got nice seasoning on this really good so for any of you international peeps who are  wondering if you're going to be getting this   anywhere overseas you actually have that  coming in the future because according to   mr beast he plans on expanding internationally  very very soon but considering the 300 locations   across the country right now it's a beautiful  situation to have it available you have some   seriously tasty stuff to look forward to and  honestly this is just a nice addition guys a   delicious double cheeseburger and the price  isn't bad on it considering especially here   on the west coast nicely done just open up your  favorite delivery apps and search mr beast burgers   so for this inaugural review of mr beast burger  here on peep this out reviews i'm gonna have to   give the mr beast burger beast style combo a rock solid 9 out of 10 guys very very tasty on this   burger and again those smash patties make  a huge difference the house seasoning the   caramelized edges are amazing on it and that  double is just enough beef to really satisfy   i just wish it was a little bit on the juicier  side but even still everything else that it had   was a beautiful situation the pickles were  very nice they had some nice snap the crunch   of the onions everything else kind of blended  in after that so the mayo wasn't really tasting   and again the ketchup and that deli style brown  mustard literally was soaked into the very top   of the bun but even still that bone was very soft  and that delivery mechanism to get it into my face   was pretty awesome the fries delicious situation a  little on the soggier side than i would have liked   but still the seasoning is decent and i love  the marketing like i said on the outside of the   packaging pretty awesome but hey aside from all  that and like i mentioned earlier in the review   it's great to know that a portion of the proceeds  of these burgers actually goes towards a very good   cause and you'd expect something like that from  mr beast because the guy literally has a heart   of gold super humble and just an amazing human  being in general a beautiful situation just from   that aspect alone all right so now the ultimate  question i'm gonna give you right now do you   have a mr beast burger somewhere available in your  area in the 300 locations across the country right   now i'm very curious to hear if you've actually  given this a shot and if you don't how excited   are you to give this one a go are you going to be  driving to give this a shot i'm hearing there's   like lines completely like down the street 10  or 20 miles deep believe it or not drop some   comments down below and definitely let me know  and with that this is Ian K closing out another   high quality foodie feature for you here on peep  this out reviews bringing you brand new content   every single
