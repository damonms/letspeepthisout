 hey everyone it's Ian K for peep this out reviews back at it once again on over at Church's Chicken to go in on the return of a classic menu favorite only this time under a different name so is it gonna be any different well stay tuned because the campfire smokehouse chicken is up next welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty so here we go with the quote-unquote new campfire smokehouse chicken here at churchs and admittedly this is a pretty decent deal for five bucks guys what you're getting here is a whole half chicken obviously you've got the wing the breast the thigh in the leg along with one of their world-famous biscuits the honey butter biscuits and a side of mashed potatoes and gravy so not a bad deal whatsoever but admittedly the seasoning on this version of it so far is looking a little light I mean it's definitely crispy it looks like it's definitely flash-fried looking decent and the size is absolutely on point but it does seem lighter compared to say the Bourbon black pepper smokehouse chicken from back in the day so let's just see if the flavor is gonna deliver on this one it's the campfire smokehouse chicken here at churchs let's peep out this flavor yesir right from the outset this actually is a pretty good deal like I said a half chicken a side and the biscuit is nothing to sneeze at for five bucks it's actually pretty good most other places you get like say three tenders and that's pretty much it and it's mostly breading this is a whole half chicken here right now so I'm very excited to see what this is about but again with that said I'm really hopeful this is gonna be a little bit different compared to some of the other versions of it that I've tried in the past so before I get into this and like always if you guys are fans

week well guys you know what let's start off with one of the signature items from them which is easily that honey butter biscuit and this is actually a wider version compared to what I'm used to here it's very crumbly as you can see it's falling and little pieces of it coming off but it looks really really nice so let me go for a quick bite of this and then we'll work our way up to the chicken hang on mmm yeah always a treat light but dense at the same time with a nice crispy outer coating and of course the honey butter goodness on the outside is a very lovely situation and this is a lot wider compared to the other versions I've had here their usual a little bit smaller a little bit taller but this is a very beautiful thing one more bite mmm yeah really really good that honey is coming through beautifully the light butteriness of it as well pretty good okay and since it's been a minute since I've had the mashed potato and gravy here at churchs it's been a very long time let's go for that real fast as well as you can see a decent mound of mashed potatoes we've got some of their gravy in there as well I believe it's a chicken based gravy let's obviously you'd assume it because it's churchs let's give this a shot it's just okay it's what you kind of expect to get from a fast-food spot here we go mm-hmm it's like a chicken gravy kind of salty but it's good and the flavor is coming through the mashed potatoes themselves are just kind of the basic stuff they're nothing too crazy there a little bit of saltiness on their own but this is a nice little add-on to have with the meal already at 5 bucks hmm yeah definitely definitely tasty so the saltiness is there and of course I have no drink today on top of it and speaking of that being that it's so hot right now in southern Cali and this is about to get into a crispy situation its crispy outside to go with the crispness I'm about to get into here but guys take a look at this a whole half chicken of goodness and again the coating doesn't seem like it's very strong I mean it's definitely coated with a coloring that you see on there it's definitely fried but it doesn't have like that black pepper bourbon type of chicken that I did over here at church as a while back that original smokehouse which was pretty good let me break off a leg here and we'll give this a go but just take a look at this here hopefully this is not gonna fall apart on me I'm trying here for you guys I'm trying oh here we go there you go I'm doing this all in the car as it's flipping there we go I was really worried about that but I figured let's just go with it it's juicy it's definitely got some nice texture to it there as you can tell I mean it's chicken let's give this a shot mm-hmm it's juicy see it's wet flavorful this is really really good and again that skin you can see it's coated but it doesn't really have like a seasoning type of coating that you see on the outside there it really just looks like standard chicken skin but it's basted for sure you can definitely taste it mmm yeah very fresh this is worth it for the five bucks alone like always hmm oh yeah this is like almost like rotisserie like chicken but like a flash fry and look how wet that is look at the bones it is definitely lit up beautifully here guys and again overall I'm liking this I mean the quality is awesome on it there we'll give you some more of these close-ups they're very little b-roll needed with this one today as you can see very crispy a beautiful situation the fried goodness there and it's a very meaty I mean the breast alone is a lovely situation look at that that is just a beautiful situation I'm gonna keep saying beautiful situation throughout guys because it really is and I love chicken like this so for five bucks you're getting a lovely thing there as well because of what it is the overall flavor and as I'm looking at this right now I think I'm just gonna go for this bite right there to finish this one out there hang on mm-hmm come on now this is ridiculous smokehouse season is back over here at churchs I'm glad I'm into this right now it's really good so after the destruction to rip off that leg from the thigh with this one as you can see there is still plenty of meat left here guys and it is a very lovely situation in terms of the coating it's falling all over the place as you can see and I'm really diggin the flavor I just wish the seasoning was a little bit more on this one compared to what it's been in the past this is actually more reminiscent of the naked smokehouse chicken from back in the day so I like that as well because the flavor is definitely there it's got just the right amount of saltiness overall but still guys the value is high and you do get a lot of chicken and a lot of food for the money so pretty decent well definitely a little bit of a messy situation with this one today guys but sometimes you got to get your hands dirty and now that I think about it my mom always told me as a kid if it flies you can pick it up and with something like that you want to pick it up and dive in because it's just so hearty that way but as hearty as it is and on the real this is really no different than say the naked smokehouse chicken from back in the day it's not so much the bourbon black pepper variant that I did as well which you guys can find in the playlist popping up on your screen if you haven't seen it already that is very similar to the naked version only and that's okay because you know what it's summertime it's campfire I see the theme they're going with but there is no difference otherwise still a crazy value and still super delicious so with that said I'm gonna have to give the quote-unquote new campfire smokehouse chicken here at church is a pretty solid 9 out of 10 the only way this could have been better is if they did something a little bit different with it now that it's back on the menu I mean I get what it was before but a little bit of a different flavor would have gone a long way to really making it feel like it's new aside from the name but guys making a mistake new name or not it's absolutely worth your time all
