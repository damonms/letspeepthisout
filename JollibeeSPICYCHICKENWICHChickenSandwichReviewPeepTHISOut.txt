 what's going on everyone and welcome back  to another high quality foodie feature for   you here on the channel where i'm back on over  at jollibee this time to check out the heated   version of their available chicken sandwich  that's right you already know so stay tuned   because the spicy chickenwich is up next to  peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty all right so let's get heated with it as we go in  on the spicy chickenwich and already guys we're   being greeted with a very nice crispy situation  right there in the middle that chicken breast   fillet is looking pretty awesome along with the  shininess of that toasted brioche right there i'm   definitely digging the appearance of this one it's  really setting off the tone all right so let's pop   the said toasted brioche and as you're going to  see underneath it guys immediately we've got some   very serious looking jalapenos right there mixed  in with some sriracha mayo and i gotta say that   combination is definitely looking pretty awesome  i love the green color tone of those jalapenos   and of course that sriracha mayo i think is gonna  add a little bit more threatening goodness to this   one for sure and of course that's sitting all  on top of their hand breaded chicken breast filet   and again crispy goodness all around it looks  like there's a little bit of a red tinge in that   hand breaded fillet but then again it could just be  playing with my head considering the sriracha mayo   combination it's definitely looking spicy though i  gotta admit really really nice looking underneath   it looks like we have another double whammy  of sriracha mayo on the bottom but guys coming   back to that chicken again this looks like a very  sizable piece here filling out this brioche style   bun very nicely and i can't wait to get into this  one it's really looking pretty awesome along with   those jalapenos those are pretty serious looking  for sure alright so let's not waste any more time   on this one this is the spicy chickenwich here  at jollibee let's peep out this flavor yeah this   looks infinitely better than the original  chickenwich that i reviewed recently guys   i have to admit the chicken itself looks a little  bit larger this time out and those jalapenos again   look pretty serious i am totally digging the size  of this one and for $3.99 this is a pretty banging   value the heftiness is real in this chicken  sandwich and i can easily see why this is a   favorite amongst a lot of you jollibee peeps that  are out there right now so without further ado   we're getting into it finally guys it's the  spicy chickenwich here at jollibee let's hit it whoa wow not only is this infinitely better  in the presentation department it absolutely   blows away the original chickenwich guys so  it's infinitely better across the board in that   regard because guys not only does it have  the good looks it's got the amazing flavor   to go with the chicken juiciness is off the  chart with this one and those jalapenos are   serious right there i'm getting a nice amount  of sizzle right now it's nothing crazy but it's   definitely adding to the overall experience and  guys that spicy sriracha mayo is another serious   situation as well this is crazy delicious right  now definitely a better choice between the two   you know the flavor profile is doing such an  amazing job with this chicken sandwich right   now let me try and pull off a little piece of  the chicken itself to see if it's actually got   some spice because guys i really want to see  if there's actually something in the coating maybe a little bit of pepper but it's the sriracha  mayo primarily and again one more time here   actually more than one more time we're going  to keep looking at this one i am digging the   size of those jalapenos they are serious for  sure keep going in guys this is really good   mmm that crunch banging now of course there's  a fair amount of heat coming from the seeds   inside those jalapenos guys but even still you're  getting a very nice amount of that sriracha mayo   the top and the bottom on top of nice crispiness  of the chicken itself and it's plentiful on top of   that guys very juicy very meaty and overall just a  nice compliment to the outer coating which is not   taking up too much of the chicken it's a pretty  nice balance i'd probably say about maybe 70% meat   30% coating and that's a lovely combination because  it definitely feels sizable for that reason   yeah definitely sizeable because this is an  actual chicken breast guys there's a lot of   white meat here and of course the coating  is complementing it beautifully but again   it's that combination that's sriracha mayo  and even though i'm not a super fan of mayo   it's more like a spicy sauce i'm not really  getting a mayo vibe but it's definitely   elevating it there a little bit of sweetness a  decent amount of sizzle and it goes amazing with   those jalapenos and again let me just pull  this jalapeno off to show you guys this is   very awesome these are a real deal guys i've never  really seen jalapenos like these on a fast food   chicken sandwich look at those seeds it's not the  usual white ones you can tell this is definitely   quality right here really really nice all  right couple more bites before we close   this one out and guys again this is pretty  banging let's go for a couple more real quick man all right that time out i got a bigger  mouth full of heat so hang on one second here wow again amazing on this guys and i'm really  blown away by the quality of this one i'm glad   i started out with the original because i kind  of figured that was the starter chicken sandwich   this is the one that you really want to go for  guys it's the most flavorful and again i can see   why all you jollibee peeps are fans of them over  here for sure again i can't wait to check out some   of the other stuff they got going on the menu here  you guys i'm so glad to have checked this one out   i gotta say the quality is absolutely up there i  had a feeling it was gonna be spicy versions of   pretty much regular chicken sandwiches usually  are and i'm glad to be giving this one for the   very first time on camera with you guys right now  so let's go for one more bite before we close the   review out with the rating coming up but guys  again a banging situation and again something   to add to the jollibee playlist guys finally  i'm glad i'm finally doing this for you hang on   all right so let's go around the world with this  one real quick and let me just also say this is   absolutely going to be my go-to chicken sandwich  here at jollibee outside of my regular reviews   because the quality speaks for itself this has  been such an awesome experience flavor-wise with   it and i can easily see myself getting this one  on occasion very nice for $3.99 and it really fills   out this bun nicely everything on the inside but  you gotta love those jalapenos guys the real deal   and they're thick cut even though there's only two  of them it's highly worth getting it really really   nice so with that said i'm gonna have to give the  spicy chickenwich here at jollibee an obvious   10 out of 10 guys there was nothing wrong with  that experience right now for $3.99 you're getting   a fairly decent sized chicken sandwich just in  between small just in between large it was really   kind of a nice balance but that combination of  that sriracha mayo and again those jalapenos   were amazing it was ultra fresh juicy crispy and  the quality of the heat on top of it was not to   deter too much but at the same time it's letting  you know that there's some sizzle there which   is awesome again the quality of the flavor  is pretty banging and again on top of that   my go-to chicken sandwich over here jollibee  if i decide to give it a go and like i said   you know i'm going to it's easily worth your  time all right so for those of you who have   been to jollibee already and i'd venture to  guess there's virtually tens of thousands   of you who already have do me a quick favor drop  some comments down below what did you personally   think between the two chicken sandwiches that  they offer over here the original and the spicy   which is your personal favorite and why drop those  comments down below and definitely let me know   and with that this is Ian K closing out another  high quality foodie feature for you here on peep   this out reviews bringing you brand new content  every single week here on my channel so while you stay   tuned for that next review coming real soon in the  meantime stay frosty all right jollibee nothing   against the original chicken witch i mean it was  pretty tasty but with the spicy
