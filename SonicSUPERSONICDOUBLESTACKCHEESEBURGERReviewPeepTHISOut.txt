see ya buh bye alright guys let's peep this out so here we go with the supersonic double stack cheeseburger and guys I gotta say this looks pretty awesome already this is definitely looking like a half pound beast for sure lots of beefy goodness right there starting off with the brioche bun on the top let's take a look underneath it looks like we have got some grilled onions we've got some pickles some mustard a little bit of mayo is thrown into the mix and naturally a half pound of beef 2 quarter pound patties guys looking nice and wet nice and juicy let's take a look on the inside further let's go down to the middle here looks like we've got two types of cheese shredded cheddar cheese and a cheddar cheese sauce so no shortage of cheesy goodness here and I'm kind of glad that it's in the middle and not necessarily on top you can see all the beefy goodness there underneath it looks like it is just the bun itself so all the action is definitely in the middle lots of cheese man that looks really really great and of course on the very top here those pickles definitely look pretty solid let's see how the flavors gonna deliver on this one because it smells fantastic it's the supersonic double stack cheeseburger here at Sonic let's peep out this flavor all right I had to move the car there real fast because it was so loud in the stall I couldn't really hear myself think with all the music blasting there and plus I really want to focus on exactly how amazing this burger is flavor-wise without being distracted but I gotta say guys already this is looking pretty great so before I hopefully confirm it for you right now and like always if you guys are fans of high quality delicious looking food reviews make sure to hit that subscribe button down below don't

lot of cheese whoa so much so I got to give you a fast close up here while I clean myself off but man guys feast your eyes on this lovely situation right now and this is an insane amount of beef loving all the cheese in this as you guys can see very thick plenty of cheese lots of grilled onions on the inside as well that I got into that first bite you can't really tell by the very top but as you can see it is still stacked nonetheless let's keep going with it but man that cheese squirt right there in that first bite was pretty awesome let's keep going mmm my god there's a lot of cheese on this right now and I'm loving it don't get me wrong I'm thinking it's awesome you know this almost kind of reminds me of the ultimate cheeseburger from jack-in-the-box it's very similar because of how much cheese it feels like it's got and not like it really feels like it does but I got to be honest this actually feels better than the biggie cheese believe it or not without that middle bun the cheese sauce makes a huge difference with this and I'm really loving the fact that the patties are really really big too it feels like a quarter pound burger and with all that cheese goodness in there how could you go wrong with that it's pretty awesome let's go for another bite as this patty is beginning to slip off the very top here it shows you how much cheese this has got guys and just to give you an idea again just look at this this is just crazy the amount of cheese it's probably one of the best burgers I've had here at Sonic and it's usually hit or miss anyway when I'm here reviewing but this is really really great let's keep going man and I'm like losing my voice while doing this right now on top of it you got to live allergy season right so let's keep going I'm going further in because I really want to keep going let's do it I'm so glad I'm doing this right now this is so delicious I love that pickle snap with these grilled onions the marinated onions if they've got on this go amazingly well with the acidity and the crunch of the pickles together and naturally with a little bit of the bite of the mustard which is not too bad definitely a lovely situation and just overall it's just a really delicious double cheeseburger so supersonic definitely I think it's well worth the name on this one and I'm so glad that this is a home run right now too because like I said it's usually hit or miss with me here at Sonic this is super fresh it's super cheesy super meaty it's beefy all around definitely delicious stuff one more bite we'll wrap this one up after the rating and of course we'll close it out hang on hmm all right so let's 360 this one around here guys and as you can see that top patty really wants to get away from you right now thanks to all the cheese on this but there is plenty of it they should really rename this one the biggie cheese for real this one really is it really is it really is a lot more satisfying and overall the crunch and everything that this one offers with the onions and the pickles is a nice combination that brioche bun is also very tasty great stuff Wow could this be it could this really be the moment well I think so with everything you've seen in her throughout this review right now I'm gonna have to give this supersonic double stack cheeseburger here at Sonic a well-deserved 10 out of 10 guys the first 10 out of 10 for Sonic here definitely on my channel at least when it comes to a burger at least that definitely satisfied very beefy very cheesy very fresh the softness of the bun it was perfectly made and if you want my opinion that actually is the biggie cheese that is full on the biggie cheese for sure guys there's just so much cheese on that it blew away that original one as well take a look at my review if you're curious to see my thoughts on the biggie cheese but that one as far as I'm concerned is the real deal definitely give that one a shot but of course I got to ask you are you gonna give this one a shot do me a quick favor drop some comments down below are you gonna be giving the supersonic double stack cheeseburger a shot over here at Sonic and if you are how do you think it's gonna
