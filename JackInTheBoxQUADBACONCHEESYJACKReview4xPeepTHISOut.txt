 what's going on everyone welcome back to another  high quality foodie feature for you here on the   channel cheaters cam style after hours back on  over jack-in-the-box to go in on what looks to be   some pretty insane looking bacon cheesy goodness  and guys for this review we're definitely taking   it to the max so let's get right on into it feast  your eyes on their all-new quad bacon cheesy jack   and i gotta say guys i am digging what i am  seeing here already this is gonna be bacon   three ways and i can't wait to get into it but  starting off with the buttery bakery bun here   let's pop it and take a look underneath looks like  we've got a little bit of that bacon mayo on top   but it's definitely more on the burgers themselves  but guys what we've got here is bacon mayo a   couple of strips of bacon itself some bacon bits  and guys four beef patties each separated with a   slice of cheese so four slices of cheese and i  gotta admit guys looking very nice very meaty   and very inviting especially with the smell of  bacon in the car right now definitely an awesome   situation and not that there really needs to  be anything on the bottom because everything   is front loaded on the top of this one guys let's  not waste any more time on it this is the all-new   quad bacon cheesy jack here at jack-in-the-box  let's peep out this flavor all right first things   first let me start this one off by saying there is  a triple variant of this burger available normally   and believe it or not that's the normal variant  the triple bacon cheesy jack but guys if there's a   quad on the menu you know your boy Ian K is gonna  hit it up so naturally that's what we've got here   right now and as you can see it is pretty insane  plenty of the bacon mayo goodness little specks of   bacon bits that are kind of spread out throughout  here but guys with the bacon strips themselves   all the cheese all the meat and a decent size  i got to admit this is looking really really   fantastic and again the aroma of bacon in my car  is off the chart it really is all right so here   we go i'm very excited to see if this one's going  to deliver the bacon goodness because like i said   the aroma is high this is the all new quad bacon  cheesy jack here at jack in the box let's do it meaty oh let me just show this to you guys this  is right off the bat a block of beef guys that is   insane right there very meaty very cheesy and  even though the patties themselves a little bit   more of the value size because of how they're stacked the  way that they are here guys it is a very hearty   bite plenty of cheese plenty of bacon flavor and  honestly guys i am so digging the experience of   this one right now this is a lot of fun to eat  and that bacon flavor is really off the chart   yeah you're probably going to hear me say the  bacon is off the chart all throughout this review   because guys with three different variations of  it how could it not and considering with me not   really being into mayo i'm so digging the flavor  of it because it's more bacon than anything else   think of like a creamy bacon type of  sauce on top of the actual bacon itself   and those bits together but guys the highlight  again i'm going to keep showing it to you   is the beef and the cheese on this one here this  is a massive triple cheeseburger with an extra   patty we'll say the quad is definitely a banging  situation let's keep going in this is really good thick man thick you know aside from this being  ultra fresh right now what's really standing out   above and beyond all the other flavors here is  the nice saltiness of the beef patties guys it's   actually very very nice and it complements the  other flavors on here very nicely salt does equal   flavor but when everything is as flavorful as this  is with the three types of bacon and the cheese   and of course the bun guys how could you go wrong  with this this is super exciting to eat right now   yeah yeah i know i mean it's just  a burger right but at the same time   it's four patties with an amazing amount  of bacon flavor on top of it and guys   four patties you don't see too often from a  lot of other fast food restaurants out there   this actually works nicely in terms of the  actual weight of the meat itself it almost   feels maybe like a double quarter pounder type  of situation here i mean it's thick it's dense   but again a little bit on the smaller side for  the bun itself but i'm really digging the quality   of everything together let's keep going  in guys this is so delicious right now um you know considering how much bacon flavor  is in this the only thing that i can really   see to improve upon what's already here is  maybe adding one more strip of bacon to this   here just for presentation purposes because  it's only got two slices on it and it's not   very thick in that department but the overall  flavor is so robust that it's really standing   out nicely and again guys the bacon mayo  the little bits that are mixed into this one   is really a nice highlight but for me it's easily  the beef and the cheese just a banging situation   again i'm gonna keep showing this to you and if  you're watching this late night right now please   accept my humble apologies but guys jack in the  box is open 24 7 in most all places that have   it so run on over and give this one a shot you  are not going to be disappointed it is banging   yeah pretty delicious stuff and like i said at  the top of this review as much as you can go   with the triple variant of that and i'm sure  that would satisfy just as nicely having the   extra meat patty makes it that much more fun  to eat and i got to admit for the price of it   $7.29 for this one's a little bit more of a premium  compared to the other quad burgers they've had in   the past i think $6.99 was the average price  point this is well worth it because of the   quality of the bacon flavor and just the overall  heartiness of what i've got here right now guys   truly delicious all right so let's go for one more  bite in this one because as you can tell i love   this burger it's probably one of my favorite quad  type of burgers i've had over here jack-in-the-box   like ever and it really is satisfying the  itch to have something like this right now   especially late night on cheaters cam just for  you guys one more bite and then we'll close it out so yeah definitely a banging burger over here at  jack-in-the-box with this one and let me just say   i'm also thankful for the burger diaper that it  comes with considering how much bacon mayo and   cheese is dripping out the back of this right  now i am so glad that it's catching everything   guys but again nice quality all around on this one  and if you like bacon cheeseburgers and if you've   made it this far to the review i think you do you  have something to look forward to definitely check   this out over at jack it's pretty awesome order  on ubereats postmates and grubhub all right now i   don't know about you guys but for me personally  this is definitely something that personifies   fast food gluttonous very delicious very tasty  very salty at the same time but overall just a   lot of fun to eat and like i said a delicious  cheeseburger on overload with plenty of bacon   goodness to go around that was super satisfying  to try right now so just to clarify it because   i think you guys all know that it's coming i'm  gonna have to give the quad bacon cheesy jack   here at jack in the box a rock solid 10 out of 10  there is nothing wrong with this particular burger   with the exception of maybe having an extra slice  or two of bacon on there guys considering all the   bacon flavor that it's got it is satisfying  just in that regard but the juiciness of the   beef patties all the cheese the heartiness of  diving into it you'll know right away when you   take that first bite it's off the chain you're in  for a definitely awesome burger eating experience   with this banging stuff okay so aside from asking  if you're going to be giving this one a shot over   here at jack in the box which i'd venture to guess  you're probably going to if you've got them in the   area which variation are you looking forward to  going in on the most the triple or maybe the quad   drop those comments down below and definitely let  me know and with that this is Ian K closing out   another high quality foodie feature for you here  on peep this out reviews cheaters cam style after   hours bringing you brand new content every
