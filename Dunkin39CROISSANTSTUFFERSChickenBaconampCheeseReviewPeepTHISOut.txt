 you already know what it is it's Ian K for peep this out reviews this time over at Dunkin to take a look at one of their all-new croissant stuffers so stay tuned because the chicken bacon and cheese variant is up next welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty so here we go with the chicken bacon and cheese croissant stuffer here at Dunkin and initial first impressions has me thinking this is a little on the small side guys it really does look very very tiny on this plate especially when it's under my hand this is very very small what we've got here is a flaky croissant that they're billing this as with everything seasoning on top so we've got some poppy seeds some sesame seeds maybe a little bit of chopped onion in there everything you probably find on like in everything bagel really and on the inside we've got chicken bacon and cheese looking like it's a little on the thin side in there as well with the filling but maybe some cheddar cheese but bacon and chicken to go with here guys and again very very small I know this is being billed as being a snack type of thing but it really is tiny but let's just see how the flavor is gonna deliver on this one it's the chicken bacon and cheese croissant stuffer here at Dunkin let's peep out this flavor yeah I don't know $3.79 for this guys and there's hardly any filling on the inside just to give you an idea of what this looks like together take a look at that there I mean it looks really really cool but again it is very very small so hopefully this is gonna deliver on the flavor because right now I'm not feeling it for the price point all right so let's just get into this one right now but real quick and like always if you guys are fans of high quality delicious looking food reviews make sure

here at Dunkin let's do it well it's okay but a little on the plain side admittedly I mean a lot of the seasoning that I'm getting from the very top of the croissant is easily coming through I'm tasting little hints of onion in that and obviously you're getting with the seed and goodness that you have there and the flakiness of the croissant is good but the filling is literally non-existent just to give you an idea I pretty much took out a good chunk of the bacon that's all that's left of the meat literally one more bite and I'm at the end of this one already here guys I got to be careful with this the cheddar cheese is pretty nice though I am digging that it definitely is cheddar and I like the overall feel but guys this needs to be a little bit more substantial for the price point so I like the flavor it's okay it just needs a little bit more of a stuffing type of situation these are stuffed croissants technically they need to be stuffed let's go for another bite there it goes that piece of bacon is pretty much gone as well it looks like it's about a strip of bacon on the inside of this with maybe two little slices of turkey and some cheese but as you guys can see right on the inside there a decent amount of cheese in the very bottom I just wish it had a little bit more of everything to go with because the croissant really is the highlight and I really love the ingredients on this one initially but I really just think it needs to be a little bit more stuffed if you know what I mean nice and crispy on the bottom it is definitely flaky and I'm really digging that but guys this needs to be a little bit more substantial for the money you're gonna hear it all throughout this review because for almost four bucks there's like nothing in this it's a taste at best but that last bite was probably the best because although I didn't have hardly any meat in it it was nice and doughy nice and chewy from the croissant itself so again let me give you another shot of the other side here as you can see a couple of slices of turkey at the most there and maybe a strip of bacon cut in half possibly and some cheese that's it so $3.79 very expensive but for a snack this is definitely tasty it just needs to be maybe like a buck 50 at the most but as you can see again decent amount of crispiness around here I'll give you as many close-ups as I can just to show you but I am loving the everything seasoning on this that really is a highlight the croissant is good the whole stuffed aspect of it needs a little work that's pretty much it yeah not too much else to say with that when I probably should have gotten the three cheese variant of that one which actually has Swiss cheddar and mozzarella I think that would have been even better along with the doughiness of the croissant because when you go for bacon and chicken you really kind of run the risk of not getting enough meat and in this case that's exactly what happened so overall I'm gonna have to give the chicken bacon and cheese croissant stuffer here at Dunkin just an OK 6.5 out of 10 it's definitely above-average the flavor is good don't get me wrong but the seasoning is really what takes this one up and the quality of that croissant itself nice and flaky nice and chewy but the filling definitely needs to be stuffed guys like I said it's a croissant stuffer give me something stuffed on the inside of it alright so now the obvious question based upon everything you've just seen in my review right now is this something that you think you personally would try drop some comments down below what did you think of the appearance in this particular one over here at Dunkin and overall what do you actually like to have on croissants when you have them drop those comments down below and
