goodness topped off with an alfredo sauce and melted cheese before it's baked up with all the goodness that you see here and looks like we've got a decent amount of chicken on top this is looking pretty pretty tasty off to the side we've got a five piece order of their bread sticks and i got to say that looks completely dusted on the top with some garlic olive oil goodness maybe a little parmesan and of course you've got some marinara sauce for dipping so this is going to be pretty tasty let's see if the flavor is going to deliver on this one because it sure looks pretty good it's the tuscani chicken alfredo pasta here at pizza hut let's peep out this flavor yeah i had a feeling i was going to be back on over a pizza i have to try this other tuscani pasta considering i did the meaty marinara recently which you guys can find in the upper right hand corner of your display right now that was pretty tasty so if you're ready for some delicious footage on that one definitely

looking really good wow wait do you see the creaminess of this one this is already looking pretty amazing let me bring you on over here feast your eyes on this that is a lovely situation let's keep it focused in nice situation on this one here let's give it a go very excited that is a thick and pasty alfredo sauce man these pizza hut pastas are pretty bomb they really are very cheesy very creamy very vibrant in flavor and there's a lot of garlic that i'm tasting on this also let me grab a little bit of the chicken to go with this here there's a lot here so i am going to lift up as much as i can take a look at that very creamy guys this is just minutes old but the baked goodness is shining through on this one here let's keep going this is really tasty and the chicken it's baked let me give you a shot here looks like we've got some white chicken breast there white meat chicken breast looking really nice mmm nice combination really really nice combination now granted it's fast food pasta but it's done very well and i got to admit the sauce is crazy i can barely lift some of these rotinis up over here i'm going to keep trying to give you as many close-ups as possible but they really soak up the sauce pretty nice you can see it's nice and creamy on the fork lovely situation yeah definitely pretty tasty you know what makes it even better right now this was actually on special for six bucks today along with the breadsticks you really can't beat the deal on that and speaking of breadsticks let me grab one of these to show you again up close another lovely situation here guys take a look at the seasoning on that parmesan garlic goodness as you can see nice and thick looks definitely nice and airy it's got some crispiness here let's swing it on around very lovely situation there and of course we gotta go for some marinara but first let me try a quick bite on its own real fast definitely buttery salty garlic a little bit of parmesan nice all right check this out let's do it little marinara sauce of course you got to have the marinara right there give it a go hmm yeah just the right amount of sweetness i'm not really a big marinara guy when it comes to breadsticks i'm more like ranch but this is pretty good and again just a nice situation all around guys a really nice compliment to that pasta by far yeah definitely love the saltiness of that and of course the marinara goes amazing with it so let's get back to it here and again let me give you another shot of that tray it's fairly deep as you can see here guys this is actually a very very nice amount of food that you get and especially on special especially on special probably the only time i think i'm ever going to say that in a review six dollars you cannot beat that whatsoever and again the combination of the chicken the alfredo sauce the rotini pasta as well it really makes a difference because that rotini really soaks it up nicely guys and overall it's just a nice combination of goodness here i mean the tray is packed and it's a lot of flavor on this one the chicken alfredo is pretty good over here at pizza hut um yeah so one more last close-up of this tray because you can never get enough good looks of all the tastiness this one has to offer a very solid amount a very hefty tray filled with that rotini pasta and the beautiful blend of the creamy alfredo and of course the baked cheese on the top along with that chicken is a lovely situation and again you can't beat it for six bucks if you can get it on promo normally $8.99 or so this is actually a very solid meal for two guys very very tasty stuff so with that said before i completely melt away in my car right now i'm gonna have to give the tuscani chicken alfredo pasta here at pizza hut a pretty rock solid 9 out of 10 value notwithstanding it's actually a really great deal for six bucks guys even at nine dollars it's not bad but overall the creaminess of that alfredo sauce is really what sells this one on top of the baked cheese and just the overall flavor in general naturally the five bread sticks along on the side there definitely along for the ride with the marinara sauce pretty tasty but for me i got to be honest the meaty marinara was just a little bit more flavorful in terms of the overall packing of everything that it had on it naturally take a look at my review in the upper right hand corner of the display if you haven't seen it already but this one the creaminess is there it's a little bit more simpler in terms of flavor but very flavorful for what you get so can't recommend it more highly especially if you're a fan of chicken alfredo and when it comes to fast food pasta guys you really can't get much better than that but of course maybe domino's has something to say about it right but hey just in case you're keeping score i actually did one of their pasta bread bowls not that long ago so take a look at what i thought of that in the upper right hand corner of your display and drop some comments down below let me know what you thought of that overall compared to what you saw today all right so now the obvious question at least for me anyway are you going to be giving this one a shot whether it's on special or not drop some comments down below did this entice you to want to give this a shot over here at pizza hut did it look pretty delicious to you drop those comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K closing out another high quality foodie feature for you here on peep this out reviews bringing you brand new content
