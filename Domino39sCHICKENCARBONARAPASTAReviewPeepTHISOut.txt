 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K  stay frosty what's going on everyone and welcome   to the channel where today I'm over at Domino's  on a rainy day here in Southern Cali to check out   another one of their available pastas for the  very first time and for this review I thought   I'd skip the bread bowl yeah I thought I'd keep  a tradition of this time out by going with one   of the regular tins and now that I think about  it I probably should have gotten the bread bowl   because my hand is kind of burning so thankfully  I've got some napkins underneath guys Feast your   eyes I might have got here this is looking awesome  the chicken carbonara I gotta say this is looking   really really nice you can really smell the bacon  goodness on this and especially the Alfredo sauce   let's break this one on down for you real fast  yes sir hot and fresh pasta on a rainy day this   is actually feeling really nice in the car here  right now guys the aroma is pretty awesome on it   as well what you're looking at here is a very  solid portion of their penne pasta topped off   with premium chicken bacon mushrooms alfredo sauce  and onions and guys again the combination of that   bacon and the alfredo sauce is very strong on this  and I gotta say again very very nice in the aroma   Department as well as the presentation Department  there's no shortage of the Alfredo goodness I   gotta say this is looking and smelling pretty  amazing and yeah I know I just said that but   if you guys were sitting here in the car with  me right now I think you would wholeheartedly   agree aside from the cool visuals I think you guys  are looking at here right now so let's not waste   any more time on this one let's get into it this  is the chicken carbonara pasta here at Domino's   let's peep out this flavor yes sir pretty lovely  on this one and they're not messing around with   the onions guys they're not diced up they're just  sliced and as you can see they are looking really   really nice and again I'm so glad I'm protecting  my hands here with this napkin underneath this   is a pretty Hot Tin guys a lot of good stuff on  the inside of this so let's grab a little of it   and wow that Aroma is crazy good on that take  a look at that guys a little bit of the bacon   action some of the mushrooms the Alfredo sauce  the onions the penne pasta let's get into this   my first time giving it a go it's the chicken  carbonara pasta here Domino's let's peep this out mmm the bacon is a highlight on this that  alfredo sauce is coming through needs   just a little bit of salt though just  a little bit but wow that is loveliness   right there guys perfectly Al Dente on  the penne pasta they really do it right   over here at Domino's when it comes to their  pastas very lovely indeed let's keep going in wow that is really nice well I gotta say  this is a pretty decent portion for $7.99   it pretty much fills out this tin nicely guys  and there's definitely a very healthy amount   of all the toppings this one is supposed to  have totally digging the overall quality of   the bacon and the alfredo sauce is obviously  all throughout this right now I just wish you   had just a little bit more saltiness to it but  what I'm getting overall is a nice flavor from   the onions as well as the mushrooms just  the combination works very nicely with this   and you know what's funny as I was looking through  my Domino's playlist I noticed that I only had two   versions of these pauses the first time out a  while back actually which you're probably seeing   a couple of them that are going to jump on your  screen here right now I did the Italian sausage   variant with the bread bowl actually which was  pretty good as well very nice there on top of a   chicken alfredo variant I believe as well and that  actually was very similar to what I'm having right   now but with the addition of the bacon the onions  and obviously the mushrooms with this I gotta say   it's very nice as well but guys the quality is  pretty cool on this for fast food conveyor baked   type of pasta like this I gotta say this is not  bad so oh wow look at this here I think this is   a nice little shot of the chicken action you  know what I got so into the Alfredo sauce and   the bacon we didn't even get into the chicken  did we where are my manners please forgive me   there we go with some of the chicken right there  in the back let's give that a go I'm sure that's   gonna be some hearty action right in there let's  do it officially now with the chicken here we go mmm oh yeah nice   the chicken has like a baked quality to it which  I really like obviously because everything else   is baked on here and we'll go for a few more on  this but guys I really like the combination of   everything together and the fact that the pasta  itself the penne as you can see is Al Dente you   get a nice bit of that nice Comfort level with  it as well too so it's hearty it goes with the   sauce naturally the bacon flavor again the  smokiness that I'm getting is really adding   overall to this along with the onions and those  mushrooms so let's go for another couple on it mmm the chicken is so good now mmm nice and if  I can just show you some of the bacon action   here these are not little bits Guys these are like  ripped pieces of the strips which is really nice so   the quality is really good and it's adding to the  aroma overall so very very nice so you know what   I'm gonna do just a couple more on this because  it's very tasty having a very tasty pasta dish   here in the car on a rainy day it's kind of fun to  film this right now so let's go for another couple mmm tastiness so yeah for those of you keeping  score at home with the amount of uh pasta reviews   that I've done over here at Domino's naturally  with those two there's actually four total so   I may swing back to do the fourth one I'll keep  that one a mystery for right now chances are if   you jump over to the Domino's website you can  figure out what it is but with this I'm so glad   to give this one a go I'm a fan of the onions  I'm a fan of the pasta and I really like the   overall quality with this one here now that  I'm looking at this here the chicken itself   I wish I had just a few more pieces of it I  guess there's a few that are here but it's   not bad guys this is really pretty tasty I  would rock this one again it's currently a   20% off coupon here locally which brings this  one down to about seven and so and change after   tax which is not bad so guys I would recommend  this one naturally very very tasty and again   it's very heated in my hands thankfully I'm  protected very good stuff on this one let's   wrap the review with the rating coming up next as  always and then we'll finish this one out hang on mmm yes sir aside from a nice healthy portion you're  getting a very nice amount of flavor with this one   although I do wish the saltiness was just a little  bit up there but considering the flavor of the   Alfredo it is coming through the bacon is a major  highlight with this one on top of the mushrooms   and the onions naturally and the chicken itself  although it's not as plentiful as I would have   liked it actually is very very tasty when you do  get a few of the pieces that are in this but guys   again the Al Dente pasta rocks and it really  is worth checking out if you haven't already   very nicely done on this one so with that said  I'm gonna have to give the chicken carbonara my   first time trying this version of the pasta over  here at Domino's a pretty awesome 8.5 out of 10 guys like I mentioned in that previous  wrap up if the Alfredo sauce was just a little bit   saltier a little bit more flavorful it would go  a long way overall but what you're getting is a   nice combination of all those other ingredients  and again with that bacon shining through a   beautiful situation on top of a very solid portion  of Al Dente penne pasta which really was another   major highlight that is a beautiful thing in and  of itself so an easy recommendation to give this   one a go if you haven't already all right so do  me a quick favor like always drop those comments   down below let me know what you thought of the  look of this chicken carbonara pasta here at   Domino's did it look pretty appetizing to
