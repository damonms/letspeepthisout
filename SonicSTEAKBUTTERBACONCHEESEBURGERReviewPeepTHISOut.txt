 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K  stay frosty what's going on everyone   and welcome to the channel where today I'm  over at Sonic America's drive in to check out   their latest limited time only promo that  quite honestly is looking pretty buttery   and of course I'm only saying that because I'm  looking right at it guys Feast your eyes on it   with me here we go at the steak butter bacon  cheeseburger and as you can see this thing is   loaded with steak butter on the very top this is  a very wet looking cheeseburger let's break this   one on down real quick man and you can really  smell that butter too all right starting off   with the standard bun let's pop in take a look  underneath and on the very top of it here we have   a nice portion of the steak butter soaked right in  along with mayo and some grilled onions and as we   pan down you're going to see a lot more of that  action guys plenty of grilled onions on this one   a lot of them there we've got slices of cheese  mixed in with this and guys again The Buttery   goodness is looking really really awesome  like I said this is a very wet cheeseburger   so yeah I'm already digging the amount of grilled  onions and bacon on this one guys and naturally   with two slices of cheese on top of that 100% pure  beef patty I think this is going to be pretty   nice but again that butter is very strong so I am  already digging that so let's not waste any more   time on this one let's see if the flavor is going  to deliver this is the all-new steak butter bacon   cheeseburger here at Sonic America's Drive-In  let's peep out this flavor yeah definitely a   pungent situation guys and that Patty is looking  nice and juicy as well and of course the very top   is littered with that steak butter this is looking  really nice and again super aromatic super pungent   and I gotta say I'm very excited to get into  this one let's give it a go finally here we go   it's the steak butter bacon cheeseburger here  at Sonic America's Drive-In let's peep this out so much butter already wow yeah that steak butter  is a major highlight guys those steak seasonings   are coming through very nicely and when it's  drenched in the amount of butter that this one is   this is very gluttonous on top of the nice flavor  of the beef that I'm getting with this one it's a   nice combination in general those are the dominant  flavors and then you can taste the hickory smoke   of the bacon slightly and naturally the creaminess  of the cheese but so far pretty nice on this one   guys let's go for another few bites on it  very rich though guys very rich hang on yeah well I really don't want to say it's too  much butter but I think it actually is for me   today guys this thing is really soaked the bun  is very wet but the overall flavors are very   rich very inviting and again the steak seasoning  is really standing out I'm getting shades of the   Chophouse Burger which I reviewed recently  gotta say that was a lovely situation as   well but with the butter on this one that is the  real standout very very flavorful and very rich   you know now that I think about it I think this is  round three with these butter type of burgers over   here at Sonic I mean they started off with the  garlic butter burger I think that was one of the   ones way back in the day I reviewed that one take  a look at it jumping up on your screen right now   on top of the Mesquite butter I believe as well  that was another lovely situation now we're into   steak butter and I gotta say it's a very nice  combination it's very similar I think overall   because of the type of seasoning but guys The  Buttery flavor is so amazing with this and it   goes awesome with a nice light oiliness of the  grilled onions on top of just the cheese and   in general and again I got to keep showing it  to you because this is really a nice looking   cheeseburger a very lovely situation with the  amount of beef this is very fresh right now and   again it very much loaded with flavor let's  go for another couple of bites on it wow well that was a little bit of a salty bite that  time guys I think some of the seasoning on the   burger itself is standing out just a little bit  more in some places than others but again I'm   going to keep showing it to you combining it  with the butter and again this is a drenched   bun full of that steak goodness right there it  goes pretty amazing I'm not tasting the Mayo   thankfully because of all the flavors of  that butter naturally and the beef and the   overall seasoning is heavy but guys a very lovely  situation on this one even if the price is just a   little up there $6.09 for this here in Southern  Cali a little bit of a premium but guys very   much more of a kind of like an upscale type of  burger I should say which really kind of levels   the playing field or exceeds it I should say  as well because guys there's really nobody else   that has garlic butter like this I mean aside  from The Buttery Jack over a jack-in-the-box   but guys this from Sonic is a very very lovely  situation so let's go for one more bite we'll   wrap the review up with the rating coming up next  but a very heavily buttery situation that's very   Ultra flavorful and definitely worth checking  out one more bite and we'll close it out hang on well let's go 360 on this one guys make sure  you've got plenty of napkins on hand because   the amount of butter on this one is very  heavy-handed at least by my location where   I got mine today but guys as you can see the  meat itself fills out the bun very nicely and   the overall textures and flavors are pretty  awesome with this the slice of cheese on the   top and the bottom to hold everything together  is a lovely thing you can taste it and when you   combine that with the steak butter the grilled  onions the Mayo which I'm not even tasting and   that's fine for even more creaminess the bacon on  top of it a very nice situation even if the bun   is a little on the smashed side the overall flavor  delivers definitely worth checking this one out so overall I'm gonna have to give the steak  butter bacon cheeseburger here at Sonic a   rock solid 9 out of 10 and guys that's saying  something considering it's a little bit more hit   and miss whenever I review over at Sonic this is  actually a very tasty cheeseburger and again the   flavors are pretty amazing on that that burger  really deserves a premium brioche style bun the   standard bun doesn't do that Justice because  of all the goodness in the middle of it but   at the same time what is in the middle of it is  ultra flavorful like I said plenty of the steak   butter that you can taste and have plenty of  napkins because you can definitely feel it on   your hands pretty nicely my hands are kind of soft  right now because of it pretty cool but guys nice   stuff overall the bacon is amazing on it and that  was an ultra fresh situation right now definitely   worth checking it out all right so do me a quick  favor drop some comments down below confirm for me   if you're going to be giving this one a go because  I'd venture to guess as always if you've made it   this far into the review you're probably going to  and if you have given it a go how do you think it   compares to say the other Butter Burgers they've  had in the past drop those comments down below and   definitely let me know and with that this is Ian  K closing out another high quality foodie feature   for you here on peep this out reviews bringing  you brand new content
