 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty pizza pizza alright everyone let's get it it's Ian K back again with another high quality foodie feature for you here on peep this out reviews this time over a little caesars because in a move that i think most of us expected we've got a brand new version of the extra most bestest out right now and it features one of my all-time favorite toppings that's right so let's go in on the extra most bestest italian sausage and i gotta say guys this is already looking tasty for what it is but initial first impressions are it's a little light on the sausage now these pizzas are billed as the most cheese the most pepperoni for the price compared to some of the national chains but as you can see here with this supposedly having more italian sausage this kind of looks like just a regular sausage pizza to me right now but still very very tasty and as you can see definitely a lovely situation in the cheese department this is actually looking really really good so while i'm not seeing an overabundance of sausage on this one it definitely has a decent amount for a regular sausage pizza but even still i'm sure it's going to be pretty tasty so let's not waste any more time and confirm the flavor on this one it's the extra most bestest italian sausage here at little caesars let's peep out this flavor yeah extra most bestest or not this is still a pretty great looking pizza guys considering the value of what you're getting here for a little over six bucks that actually looks fairly decent with an okay amount of sausage i might have to add and plenty of cheese at least all right so before i get into this one and like always if you guys are fans of high quality delicious looking food reviews make sure to hit that subscribe

always a challenge in the car let me pull up one of these slices here it's a lovely situation guys i mean considering this is a nice fat slice too look at that lovely situation it's that standard thin crust action they've got here their standard pizza crust i should say looking really really good and obviously plenty of cheese as you can see and some of that italian sausage goodness right there let's give it a shot it's the extra most bestest quote quote-unquote with italian sausage let's do it tasty it's little caesars you already know what it is it's got that nice little tang for the tomato sauce and a very decent amount of cheese and again the sausage is a lovely situation now i'm definitely a fan of this type of sausage naturally instead of just a regular pellet style this is a little bit bigger i mean granted they're a little small on some of the pieces but overall they're chunky and they definitely have a lot of flavor so very lovely situation on the crust it definitely complements everything here and plenty of cheese so it's already winning in the cheese game for sure let's keep going let's get just a little closer on that italian sausage and as you can see they are browned pretty beautifully as this is baked with all the other goodies on this pizza guys and i'm really digging the crust even though i haven't gotten to it just yet you can already tell that is gonna be a nice crispy situation right there and like i said for a little over six bucks it's a value pizza but what you're getting is pretty solid so while it is a little light on the sausage even though it's considered the extra most bestest this is actually very very tasty even still for a little over six bucks you know aside from this just being a really really tasty pizza right now i think half the fun is actually picking it up i'm a huge fan of the pizza portal over at little caesars where you go in there you pop in the code that they give you after you make your purchase and then the pizza slides out after that door opens up i'm definitely digging that but i gotta say that on top of it is super fun so the contactless way of picking up your food is definitely A+ over there and honestly with the food being halfway decent this is still a very tasty pizza guys and although i wish it had just a little bit more of the italian sausage i'm diggin what i got here right now because the flavor is pretty good let's keep going this has just the right amount of saltiness coming from that italian sausage and the combination of the cheese together and that really works very well it's one of the reasons i really like italian sausage on pizza it seems so much more vibrant and less greasy compared to pepperoni and just overall the flavor just delivers on it and when you combine all that with the nice cheesy goodness and of course the thinness of the crust on the very bottom of this one here you really can't go wrong with it guys it's a real nice combination and speaking of the crust let's go for a quick bite in the back real fast toasty bread nothing wrong with that all right so let's go for one more bite of this one before i finish this one out after the rating but guys it's little caesars it's what you'd expect to get for a little over six bucks but i have to admit with the extra most bestest name i was really wishing there was just a little bit more italian sausage kind of covering it compared to the way that it looked with that initial close-up but guys still very very tasty one more bite we'll finish it out all right so extra most bestest name or not you're still getting a fairly decent pizza for the size and especially for the money compared to the other chains out there across the country guys as you can see it's a lovely situation in the cheese department the crust is very nicely done and the sausage really does deliver it's got just the right amount of saltiness to complement everything and overall it's a very tasty italian sausage style pizza not bad pizza pizza so with that said i'm gonna have to give the extra most bestest italian sausage pizza here at little caesars just an okay 7.5 out of 10 and honestly i really can't go much above that because as you're probably telling by now this really feels like a regular italian style pizza just for a value type of price and there's nothing wrong with that but when you're billing it as extra most bestest it needs a little bit more on it to look more prevalent in terms of the italian sausage department but guys the flavor does deliver the cheese is awesome the crust is nice and crunchy in the bottom nice and crisp and overall it works i mean guys come on it's an italian sausage pizza how bad could this really be right all right so i've got just one important question for you right now if you're a fan of the extra most bestest pepperoni pizza arguably one of the most popular pizzas on the menu over here at little caesars how excited are you to give that version of that pizza a shot with italian sausage drop some comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K closing out another high quality foodie feature for you here on peep this out
