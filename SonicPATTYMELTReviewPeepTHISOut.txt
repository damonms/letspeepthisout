 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty Sonic America's drive-in debuts a new patty melt with a little Texas toast Flair but does that toast truly make this a better burger well inquiring minds want to know and by inquiring minds I mean my own very curious to see what this one's all about take a look at the Texas toast patty melt from Sonic and already we're greeted with a very thick Texas toast presentation here it's all buttered up very nicely on the top let's take a look on the inside looks like we have got some grilled onions we've got some Mayo looks like we've got some mustard in there you've got two slices of cheese and that's all with a quarter pound beef patty here guys looking a little on thin side I got to admit let me see if we can go a little further in and it looks like nothing on the bottom so a pretty simple build on this one but definitely smells tasty I got to admit guys you can really smell the grilled onions in here and the presentation is fairly thick on that toast but guys it is just a little small compared to my hand this is definitely a small burger for $3.99 let's see if the flavors gonna deliver on this one though it's the all new Texas toast patty melt here at Sonic America's drive-in let's peep out this flavor yeah it's definitely a pretty small burger size-wise at least for my hands but it is thick and that actually is a very cool thing so like always before we get into this one if you guys are fans of high quality delicious looking food reviews make sure to hit that subscribe button down below and don't forget to tap the Bell icon so you can be notified as soon as new content drops every week let's get into this one guys it's the all-new Texas toast patty melt brand new here at sonic mmm it is thick mostly bread though well it's a little on the dry side even with the butteriness that I'm getting from that bread there's really not a lot of moisture that I'm getting with the exception of the cheese adding some nice creaminess to it but the meat itself is a little on the dry side let's keep going with this one and I'll give 'ya that close up flavor though not too bad well it is Texas toast so you are expecting the bread to be thick and you can definitely tell it is but as you can see in the very middle there the meat itself is a little on the thin side even though it's a quarter pound patty it can definitely use some more moisture the flavor is just okay but the mixture of the grilled onions and the mustard are really what's singing with this one on top of the creaminess of the cheese but so far it's just okay and thankfully at least for me anyway I'm not tasting really any of the Mayo which is a good thing because flavor of the grilled onions along with the cheese and then mustard is a very potent combination so the flavor is pretty much coming from that with a little bit of the flavor from the beef after that believe it or not it's really everything added on top of this patty melt that's singing on top of the beef and I don't know if I like that too much but I like the overall flavor of what this is even if it's a little on the small side like I said Texas toast notwithstanding it's still just okay for what it is so let's do a little 360 just to round this one out well I'm definitely getting a patty melt vibe with this one especially with the grilled onions and the cheese I only wish the meat itself that it's on was just a little bit thicker like I always said it really doesn't feel like 1/4 pound of beef considering how small it is and even though the Texas toast is thick the overall appearance is a very small sandwich so for $3.99 it's just okay the flavor is decent but I just wish the overall burger itself was thicker to match the thickness of the Texas toast itself but again just okay and let me also say make sure you guys have plenty of napkins handy because there is plenty of butter top and bottom on this one guys my fingers are pretty lit up so overall I'm gonna have to give the Texas toast patty melt here at Sonic just an OK 7 out of 10 I think you obviously know how I feel about this one based upon everything you've seen and heard up to this point so do me a quick favor drop some comments down below let me know if you're gonna be giving this one a shot and if you are are you generally a fan of patty melts to begin with drop those comments down
