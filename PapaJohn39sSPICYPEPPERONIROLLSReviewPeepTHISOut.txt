crust pizza that's right  and you already know so stay tuned because the   spicy pepperoni rolls are up next welcome to  peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty yes sir i've got some freshly baked goodness in  my hands here right now combined with a beautiful   aroma of pepperoni guys feast your eyes on what  i'm looking at here it's the spicy pepperoni rolls   from papa john's and as you guys can see a very  lovely situation that fills out this box pretty   nicely let's break this one down real quick all  right so very simply what we've got here is some   of the fresh pizza dough from papa john's filled  with signature pizza sauce pepperoni jalapenos   and melted cheese and then obviously it's baked  and cut into eight pieces as you can see here   and i got to say guys very very lovely in terms of  the presentation and the aroma is awesome perfect   size for dipping and speaking of which of course  we're going to be going into some of their spicy   garlic dipping sauce that this comes with very  nice add-on i must say and it does complement the   whole jalapeno and pepperoni theme pretty nicely  with a little bit of extra heat i'm thinking   so there you go these are the all-new spicy  pepperoni rolls here at papa john's let's peep   out this flavor yes sir i'm really digging  the aromatic goodness that you've got on   your screen here right now guys this looks  really really great okay let me lift up one   of these and we'll get started and wow these are  really puffy take a look guys a little close up   for you plenty of cheese the pepperoni and the  jalapeno action and of course that fresh dough   this is looking really nice here we go one  last time before we get into it as always   it's the spicy pepperoni rolls here  papa john's let's peep this out nice little hit of heat from that jalapeno  pepperoni and the cheese oh yeah very tasty   yes sir definitely some tasty stuff and obviously  with anything made to order it's gonna be pretty   awesome right and this is no exception guys take  a look on the inside of this one here looks like   we've got about two pepperonis per roll and i  gotta say a very decent amount of that cheesy   action i took out that jalapeno with one bite but  even still i'm really digging the overall quality   and these are kind of hearty to dive into pretty  nice you know now that i think about it one of   my first papa john's reviews here on the channel  i believe was the original pepperoni rolls back   in the day so obviously with the addition of  jalapeno goodness to this and of course that   spicy garlic dipping sauce it's a nice little  upgrade and again guys little cheesy action of   fresh baked pizza though you really can't say  that at all so let's knock this one out and   we're going to get into some of that spicy garlic  guys because i really gotta check that out hang on yes sir this stuff is going to be pretty amazing  guys and considering this actually came out not   that long ago which i reviewed back in the day as  well take a look at that review jumping up on your   screen here right now i can only imagine what  it's going to add to these pepperoni rolls so   let's get this going here i'm going to open this  up and obviously it's going to look just like the   amazing garlic dipping sauce as it tries to  focus in but with a little bit of heat added   for that mix you can see it's got it kind of  mixed in there there's something going on all   right let's lift up one of these and we'll give  this a shot let's give this a go dipping action   get it lathered up let's just go a little  bit more in there there we go here we go   spicy garlic dipping action let's see what it  does to the spicy pepperoni rolls here we go buttery goodness garlic goodness heated goodness  mmm oh yeah that is a nice kick right now   wow and i forgot my water again what is wrong  with me lately mmm guys this is really good though   nice sizzle nice burn lost a little bit of that uh  pepperoni in there but as you can see loveliness   that is so good pepperoni in there mmm wow that  is really good looks like i had about three   pepperoni in that one wow it is swimming around  swimming around in there for sure pretty nice   yeah that's definitely some heated goodness for  sure let's go for one more on these guys and again   a very lovely situation looks like i've got a  little bit more pepperoni in some than others and   that's actually pretty nice nice little surprise  but wow this garlic action goes amazing not just   with their pizza but obviously with the dough that  everything else is made out of it is really tasty   mmm yeah there's a lot of pepperoni in  this one oh wow oh that is some heated   goodness right now just look at that man i'm  kind of having a problem right now so good   yeah the light spice that i'm getting from the  pepperoni on these as well as the jalapeno and   obviously pairing it up with that spicy garlic  dipping sauce it's a triple threat of flavor   goodness guys all across the board so let's  knock out this last piece before we wrap the   review up with the rating coming up next now  my mouth is beginning to water like crazy guys   this is a very lovely situation and a very  nice add-on i gotta say to anything you get   over here at papa john's pretty banging one  more bite we'll close this one out hang on well i gotta say these things present pretty  beautifully and as you can see it looks like   i've got about four pepperoni on the inside of  this one along with a couple of jalapenos in the   middle and obviously that cheese and the tomato  sauce goodness guys but pairing it up with that   dough that you're seeing here is a very lovely  situation indeed i would definitely recommend   having something to drink on the side because  that spicy garlic dipping sauce adds a lovely   dynamic to this one flavor-wise but again very  very tasty and very hearty these are a lot of fun   to check out for sure better ingredients better  pizza papa john's yeah my mouth is pretty lit   up right now guys but i have to say a very fun  experience checking this one out here right now   and considering what this is being paired up with  in terms of the advertising naturally with the new   epic pepperoni stuffed crust pizza out right now  again take a look at that review jumping up on   your screen here right now that was fun to check  out recently this is a nice little add-on to that   to give you even more added heat as my voice is  beginning to go right now it is no joke with the   amount of heat in that right now on top of that  spicy garlic dipping sauce it is really really   nice it burns beautifully but i gotta say guys the  flavors do stand out very well made and definitely   something to try without a doubt all right so with  all that said i'm gonna have to give these all new   spicy pepperoni rolls here at papa john's a pretty  awesome 9 out of 10 guys and that's coming   from someone who doesn't really favor pepperoni  too much compared to other toppings out there but   the flavor is pretty banging on that overall it  just delivers across the board the right amount of   cheese a very solid amount of heat and obviously  with the jalapenos thrown into the mix there   and the overall fresh dough it's made very well guys  definitely give this one a shot it's pretty tasty   all right so do me a quick favor drop some  comments down below let me know how excited   you are to give these all new spicy pepperoni  rolls a shot and if you've had the original   pepperoni rolls back in the day are you even more  excited now that these are kicked up a little bit   of extra spice drop those comments down below and  definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K   closing out another high quality foodie feature  for you here on peep this out reviews bringing   you brand new content every single week here on  my channel so while you stay tuned for that next review   coming real soon in the meantime stay frosty you  know i gotta say what really sets this one off   for me is easily gonna be that fresh pizza dough  that makes the difference big time because
