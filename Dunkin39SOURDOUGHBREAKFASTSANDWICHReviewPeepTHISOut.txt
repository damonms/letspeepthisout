over at  dunkin to take a look at one of the latest entries   on their fall menu and guys i gotta say this is  looking pretty awesome feast your eyes on this   sourdough breakfast sandwich definitely a very  substantial situation we've got going here guys a pretty   hefty looking sandwich let's pop the top of the  semi-toasted sourdough and see what we've got here   looks like plenty of bacon plenty of white cheddar  and i gotta say guys it looks really awesome just   with that but obviously the main star of the show  here aside from it is two fried eggs on the bottom   and i gotta say the presentation looks pretty  awesome so without further ado let's get on   into this one right now and see if the flavor  is going to deliver because it looks awesome   it's the all-new sourdough breakfast sandwich  here at dunkin let's peep out this flavor   alright so i don't think there's any way you  could not say this is not one hefty looking   sandwich guys this looks really substantial and  there's plenty of crispy bacon on this one here   and those fried eggs look amazing along with  the white cheddar just a lovely situation and   the toastiness of that bread although i wish  it was just a little bit more brown on top   still looks pretty fantastic so real quick  like always you guys are fans of high quality   delicious looking food reviews make sure to hit  that subscribe button down below don't forget   to tap that bell icon so you can be notified  as soon as brand new content drops every week   guys here we go the sourdough breakfast sandwich  here at dunkin man let's get into this let's do it mmm oh the bacon and the white cheddar  right away and then the fried egg   mmm man yeah that is tasty and the good thing  about this is the fried egg is not greasy it's   not oily at all and as you guys can see on  the inside there take a look at the yolk   on the very bottom pretty substantial overall  in that girth department guys take a look at   all the bacon on the inside that white  cheddar has got a nice flavor as well   but i have to admit the nice fluffy toastiness of  that sourdough is really setting this one off on   top of everything else but that egg is amazing on  this one let's keep going in this is pretty hearty oh yeah i'm not even gonna lie i was kind of  wondering if this was gonna be one of their   best breakfast sandwiches yet and i have to admit  i am digging this a lot more than anything else   i've ever had in the past i think there was  like a croissant type of sandwich that i had   i'll have that popping up on your screen here  right now from way back in the day but this   easily takes the cake because of the amount of  bacon looks like there's about maybe six half   strips on this and i gotta say it really sets the  tone guys the non-greasiness that fried egg and   the overall nice flavor from that white cheddar is  a lovely situation and again no shortage of flavor   on this one this really feels like an authentic  breakfast sandwich so i'm going to go for another   bite on this one we're going to keep going in  because i really want to this is really good i'm so enjoying this right now so glad there's two  eggs on this too so yeah just a crazy delicious   situation on this with just the right amount of  saltiness overall this is nothing really over the   top but again the nice flavor that i'm getting  the smokiness from the bacon itself and that   white cheddar is a beautiful thing and of course  the non-greasy fried eggs that are really setting   this one off just overall a very tasty basic type  of sandwich but easily a top tier because of what   it offers so delicious stuff all around guys it  really is alright so let me go for one more bite   of this one then we'll close this one out after  the rating but guys super delicious you already   know this is going to be pretty highly rated right  now definitely worth your time let's go for it   well just a beautiful amount of classic  breakfast flavor with this one guys i have   to say this really is one of the best sandwiches  i've ever had over here at dunkin by far i love   the toastiness of the bread although i wish  it was just a little bit more brown than it is   but overall the flavors of the bacon the white  cheddar and of course those fried eggs are amazing   they could immediately just put one big one on  here and that would have been it but the fact that   you're getting two is a lovely situation there as  i'm trying to keep the focus but as you can see   we're doing 360 all the way around easily worth  your time and at almost five bucks for this i'm   so glad this is worth it right now super delicious  so there you have it and with that i'm gonna have   to give the sourdough breakfast sandwich here at  duncan a pretty rock solid 9 out of 10 and as   you can probably guess the main reason it's not  the perfect 10 out of 10 is because the browning   was not really there on the top it could have  been just a little bit crisper but overall guys   this really delivered in the flavor department and  like i said it's not greasy that's the really cool   thing about that awesome flavor from the bacon the  white cheddar was amazing and the fact that you're   getting two fried eggs which were really pretty  nicely quality made i gotta say guys just overall   a bangin breakfast sandwich for real okay but  now the obvious question does this one actually   look pretty good to you drop some comments down  below let me know what you thought of this one   in general and if you're a breakfast person and  you've got dunkin in the area which i think most   of you guys do are you going to be giving this one  a shot drop those comments down below definitely   let me know and with
