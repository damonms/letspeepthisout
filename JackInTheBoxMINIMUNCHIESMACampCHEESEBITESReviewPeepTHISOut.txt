 hey everyone welcome back to another high quality  foodie feature for you here on the channel   cheaters cam style once again over at  jack in the box to go in and some pretty   tasty looking mac and cheese bites  so stay tuned because they're up next   welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty so here we go with the mini munchies mac and  cheese bites here at jack in the box and already   that fried outer coating is wafting up in the  car pretty beautifully guys i am digging that   fried aroma for sure it really does smell  pretty fresh what we've got here is a six   piece order of what they're claiming to be creamy  mac and cheese coated in said fried outer coating   and i gotta say deep fried to a crispy golden  brown they look really really nice and as i'm   lifting these up here right now a very nice  hefty situation they've got some weight to them   and i'm digging the overall look guys really  really nice overall for dipping they're pairing   these up with my all-time favorite over here at  jack-in-the-box their buttermilk house sauce aka   ranch a lovely situation that's gonna be good with  the fried outer coating i have a feeling already   but guys definitely a lovely looking fried  situation here let's see if the flavor is   going to deliver on these this is the all  new mini munchies mac and cheese bites here   at jack-in-the-box let's peep out this flavor yesir i do love me some fried snacky goodness after   hours guys and hopefully these are going to be  as cheesy in the mac and cheese department as   they're claiming to be because i'm a huge fan  of mac and cheese without a doubt but guys very   hefty on these i am really digging the feeling  in my hand here right now they definitely feel   nicely fried as you can see and nice and dense  let's not waste any more time on this one guys   it's the all new mini munchies mac and cheese  bites here at jack in the box let's do it right away oh yeah yes right after i bit  into the outer coating of this one guys   you feel that cheese pop instantly it is very very  dense let me see if i can try and focus that in   guys look at that nicely loaded it is  a very rich type of american cheese   not really like kraft but it's got a  thickness to it and it is a banging situation   with the crispiness on the outside over  here but guys look at all that on the inside   that is a lovely situation let's go  for another bite on this very tasty hmm absolutely wow i am loving the pastiness  of the cheese they're using on this guys it's   not overly fried where you're really feeling  like an extra crunch it's just nicely lightly   crunched and then you get into it further with  that mac and cheese action but guys a lovely   situation the coating is just light enough where  it really doesn't overpower the inside they want   that mac and cheese to be the star of the show and  i really think it is this is really really tasty   it's got some nice flavor and again the cheese  is dense it's rich it's thick let's keep going in oh yeah you know that was only one of these that  i've just eaten here right now and i'm already   wishing i would have gotten the mega munchies  version of this guys which is basically a double   variant of this the mini munchies is the six  piece the 12 piece is actually gonna be the mega   and guys for seven bucks just on its  own i think it's worth it for that   this is really really good let me go for another  one of these and we're definitely going to be   going for a dip in that ranch guys but on its own  a lovely situation again let me show it to you   try and focus that in there there we go guys  it is nicely thick in terms of just the way   that this is guys i'm really digging that  it's almost like you can kind of see through   how much cheese is on the inside  of that there let's go again oh yeah i am digging that a lot and as this is  just the second one that i'm getting into right   now the cheese is beginning to kind of remind  me of velveeta believe it or not it's got the   thickness the consistency and almost a similar  type of flavor but it's dense guys and honestly   again i really love the fact that it's really  standing out above and beyond the coating on   the outside which as you can see is not super  thick i mean it's really nice there's a lot   of cheesy goodness on the inside of this guys  delicious stuff mmm digging that and considering   how well i'm digging that right now actually i  think it's gonna bode very nicely even further   as we get into some buttermilk house sauce aka  the ranch action on this guys let me actually   open this up really quick and then we'll go for a  little dip on this one ranch is like my all-time   favorite with anything with anything fried i  think it's gonna be amazing and then naturally   anything with chicken fried chicken naturally  as well let's go for a little dunk action there   try and keep that focus there we go nice and  thick guys the ranch over here at jack is   definitely a bomb situation i just know this  is gonna be ridiculous right now let's go   mmm man this is heavenly good right now so  tasty let's just knock this one off real quick   mmm man the tartness the tang of this that goes  amazingly well three of these guys three of these   down i'm moving on to the next one let's just keep  going for it a lovely fried situation and a major   highlight to have something like this available  right now this is truly decadent stuff right now man that cheese is so strong i am really  digging that solid guys really really solid   perfectly fried as well i really like the fact  that it's not overly fried although i do kind   of wish it was just a little bit crunchier that  would be really nice as well and i think maybe   just an extra 30 seconds in the fryer would  really do wonders for this but as it stands   a super delicious situation on this by far let's  just knock this last one off guys very very tasty so i thought for this last shot we try and  break one in half so you guys can kind of see   the denseness as i'm experiencing it here  guys with these bites and as you can see   that is just loveliness all around i am so  digging the amount of quality with this one   the cheese the quality of the noodle on the inside  it's slightly al dente but overall a very   velveeta-esque type of cheese action with this with a very  light coating on the outside and again fried to a   crispy golden brown a lovely situation and just  an amazing situation when you add the buttermilk   sauce aka that ranch action great stuff order on  ubereats postmates and grubhub and hey i think my   camera was kind of freaking out towards the end  there as well because of how tasty that looked   with the focus going in and out but let me just  say guys a lovely situation checking this one out   late night the creamy goodness from the mac and  cheese is completely warranted on that like i said   the velveeta-esque type of cheese they're  using with that is very thick very pasty   with just the right amount of coating on the  outside for me personally i think it maybe just a   little bit crispier would have been pretty awesome  to get more of a crunch but considering how much   is in that like i said maybe an extra 30 seconds  or so would have been perfect but as it stands   super delicious and easy recommendation i only  wish i got the mega munchies version of that   i'm probably gonna get this one again off camera  it's that good delicious stuff and again it's   mac and cheese how bad could it be so with all  that said and especially after the excitement   of giving this one a shot here on camera right now  as an official review and especially enjoying the   flavor because it was so delicious i'm gonna have  to give the mini munchies mac and cheese bites here   jack-in-the-box a rock-solid 9 out of 10 and guys  honestly it really is a 10 out of 10 as far as i'm   concerned like i said i just wish the crispiness  was just a little bit more on the outside   considering the denseness on the inside like i  said half a minute more probably in the fryer   would be perfect with it but guys as it stands  they're very delicious but do yourself a favor   just get the mega munchies variant of this one guys  with the extra six because i'm telling you once   you get started you're gonna wish you had it i  know i do but guys delicious stuff all around all   right so the obvious question because for those of  you guys who are familiar with my channel already   especially the jack-in-the-box playlist you're  going to remember that i actually checked out the   mini munchies variety pack a while back in the  day and that actually had a variation of fries   in addition to actually onion rings and mozzarella  sticks this new variant is pretty much just two   versions of fries and the mac and cheese bites  which is still decent but it's a dollar more   expensive now four bucks compared to three even  still are you going to be giving this one a shot   drop those comments down below and definitely let  me know and with that this is Ian K closing out   another high quality foodie feature for you here  on peep this out reviews cheaters cam style after   hours bringing you brand new content every single  week here on my channel so while you stay tuned for   that
