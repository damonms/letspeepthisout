 hey everyone it's Ian K and welcome or welcome  back to the channel where today i'm over at   burger king to check out the latest feature  packed version of their latest promo whopper   and now available for a limited time only  that's right it's the southwest bacon whopper   so stay tuned because it's up next welcome to  peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty yes sir this is looking like one seriously  pumped up whopper right now guys feast your   eyes on it here we go with the southwest  bacon whopper and as you can see there   is a lot going on with this one let's just get  started right away by popping the top on it   and you're gonna notice we've  got a lot of avocado spread   and chopped lettuce on the inside of the sesame  seed bun here guys a lot of goodness there   as we pan down it's a laundry list of goodies  we've got tomatoes onions a spicy spread sauce   tortilla strips three half strips of bacon mixed  into that two slices of american cheese and that's   all on top of a 100% flame grilled whopper patty  and as you can see lots going on with this one   nothing on the very bottom but that's cool because  it's all front loaded but guys plenty of toppings   on this one and definitely looking like it's  gonna satisfy for sure so yeah like i said   definitely one pumped up looking whopper for  sure on this one guys let's get into it right   now let's definitely peep this out it's the all  new southwest bacon whopper here at bk here we go guacamole right away a little salty but  there's plenty of it yeah you gotta love   some front loaded guac guys it's actually not bad  considering it's one of the main stars of the show   on top of those crispy tortilla strips i'm  actually getting a little bit of crunch from   that which is kind of cool but guys all  the classic whopper goodness on this one   very very nice indeed so far let's go for  another few bites on this guys not bad mmm that bacon is good yeah i'm totally digging  that guacamole along with the bacon and the   tortilla chips they really kind of jump in flavor  and you can really taste them as you get further   in along with the whopper patty itself a very  lovely situation along with the cheese but guys   again the front loaded goodness of that guac is  really setting this one up even though it's a   little on the salty side everything is really  beginning to sing on this one not bad for a   whopper of this caliber absolutely yeah it's  a pretty cool topping choice with this one and   considering you can also go for the impossible  variant of this one as well as a whopper junior   on top of it as well as a double on top of it guys  you've got four options to go in on including the   original that i'm doing right now but guys very  very tasty on this one and again it's a whopper   but on steroids because the guac is definitely  pronounced on this one there's almost as much   guac in this as say regular mayo on a standard  whopper and that's actually a good thing because   you know how heavy-handed bk can be with the  mayo so the fact that i'm getting a lot of guac   considering the price point for this one a little  over eight bucks i'm definitely appreciating that   greatly so let's go for another couple of bites  on this one guys very tasty it's classic bk with   some southwest flare you gotta love that  let's go for another couple on it hang on all right so there we go with a decent amount  of that spicy spread sauce it's like a peppery   type of sauce i mean nothing too crazy over  the top but it does add additional zip to   the actual guacamole on top of it and the  smokiness of the bacon and again all those   southwest flavors dovetailing right into the  crunchiness of the tortilla chips on this one   guys it's actually a very nice combo along  with the classic flavors of the whopper so   pretty tasty overall with this one it's pretty  feature packed like i said all right so let's go   for one more bite of this one before we wrap  the review up with the rating coming up next   but guys a very fun variation of the whopper  and i really like the fact that they're doing   more things with the whopper as opposed to the  king burgers and there's nothing wrong with that   either but at the same time having a whopper of  this caliber with some toppings like this as well   with a lot of guac is going a long way to  satisfying my expectations of a promo whopper   especially considering how tasty this one is let's  go for one more bite and we'll wrap it up hang on yeah i am so loving the fact that there is  so much guac spread out underneath the top   of this bun guys it really covers everything  beautifully and the combination works so well   along with the bacon and the tortilla chips while  it's a little on the salty side just a little bit   as you get further in all the other flavors begin  to sing and guys again a very fun version of the   whopper with this one for summer really really  nice so with that said i'm gonna have to give   the all-new southwest bacon whopper here at bk  a pretty solid 8.2 out of 10 guys the flavors   really jump off this one especially in the  guacamole and the bacon department with the   added crunch of those tortilla chips you gotta  love that combination across the board a little   bit of the spicy action coming from the sauce but  it's just a little bit of a sizzle nothing really   to write home about but at the same time a nice  combination of flavors with this one even if it's   just a little on the salty side because of how  much guac is in that it is still very very tasty   across the board and an easy recommendation  if you love the whopper to give a shot   all right so i'd venture to guess if you've made  it this far into the review you are going to be   giving this one a shot so do me a quick favor  drop those comments down below let me know if   you're going to do just that and how excited are  you to try a different version of the whopper   compared to what you may be used to over the years  this is definitely something different and the   quality is pretty tasty on this one drop those  comments down below and definitely let me know   and with that this is Ian K closing out another  high quality foodie feature for you here on peep   this out reviews bringing you brand new content  every single week here on my channel so while you stay   tuned for that next review coming real soon in  the meantime stay frosty yes sir i do love me some guacamole on a tasty cheeseburger and i  gotta say considering how heavy-handed it
