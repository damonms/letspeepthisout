meaty marinara pasta is up next welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty so here we go with the Tuscani meaty marinara pasta and guys I am instantly greeted by lots of lovely Italian seasoning in the car right now on top of a very nice presentation of melted mozzarella cheese feast your eyes on that this is a fairly deep tin that I'm looking at here filled in with pasta we've got a meaty marinara sauce seasoned with Italian goodness topped off with some cheesy goodness guys wow that is looking really really good smells fantastic next to it looks like we've got five breadsticks a very decent size and I got to say for $8.99 this is not a bad deal looks like it's seasoned off there with some parmesan you can see what looks like olive oil goodness possibly there but it definitely looks really really inviting but I am really blown away by this the main event this smell is classic it smells delicious and I'm not gonna waste any more time with this one guys let's get into it and see if the flavor is gonna deliver because I am diggin it already it's the Tuscani meaty marinara pasta here at Pizza Hut let's peep out this flavor Wow guys this looks really really fantastic I mean I was expecting it to kind of look like the picture and honestly this really does deliver take a close look at all of that melted cheese on the very top right there that is looking really really nice and it's got some heft to it as well I mean look at the thickness of this tin it's definitely packed up pretty nicely alright so as my fingers are getting nice and toasty right now because this thing is virtually burning hot I've got them pretty much protected with a napkin underneath me and before we get started like always if you guys are fans of high quality delicious looking

let me get a little bit of everything here which its really pretty basic ingredients but that cheese is a lovely situation man there is a lot of meat on this guys take a look at this that is nice here we go let's see how Pizza Hut does it over here mmm they do it right Wow very meaty hmm overly seasoned with the Italian goodness on this one lots of basil rich flavor coming from that meat guys this is really really good as you can see it's kind of hard to mess up something like this but thankfully it's not watery the sauce is pretty thick mmm Wow oh yeah and the cheese on the very top of this here let me grab a little bit of that of course I'm gonna keep giving you these close-ups here that is a lovely situation take a look at that almost like mama used to make honestly it's got that feel to it it's really kind of old-world style if I can say it that way but the seasoning is good the flavor is good the noodles themselves are kind of al dente so they have a little bit of firmness to a little bit of texture so they're not kind of watered-down or anything like that but this really tastes like the sauce has been simmering and I got to say guys the flavor is poppin on this one mmm I am digging that all right let's see how the bread stick is nice and seasoned as you guys can see their thickness is on point very very nice all the way around let's give this a shot mmm that's got a nice pop to it as well I wouldn't say it's like Olive Garden pop but the saltiness is similar and even though they're not really round like Olive Garden I do like the fact that you can really taste the airiness of the bread a little bit better on this one the fact that they're kind of squared off like this so they obviously just drop these into their conveyer ovens there and kind of toast them up but this is lovely guys the saltiness is nice the Italian seasoning on this as well a little light butteriness to it overall lemme get a little bit of that sauce action here a little meaty goodness if you will let's see if we can get a little bit on here well maybe just a little bit just for flavor we'll add just a little bit in there but as you can see a nice sauce it really soaks it up onto the bread mmm yeah this is pretty bangin it really is and this is only one of the trays that they offer there's another one they have on the menu I think it's an alfredo variant and you can mix and match for family-style with this so you can actually get two of these trays and a whole bunch of breadsticks and I got to admit I may actually do that because this is pretty bangin already on its own but on its own I should say again let me grab a little bit of everything on here the flavor is nice the tin is packed they have a lot of really really awesome flavor coming out of this one here and of course a nice side of those breadsticks to go with it's a lovely situation and the flavor is just delivering like I said all throughout this review so far it's nicely done the al dente noodles the meat itself nice and hearty there's a decent amount of it in here as you can see and plenty of mozzarella cheese guys look at that here let me focus that in just a little bit for you it is a lovely situation when it comes to the cheese department on this so definitely bangin definitely worth it and yeah I'm probably gonna be back to get this one again the wifey's gonna dig this I think hmm so one more glory shot for you here guys plenty of mozzarella cheese melted over this one here and the flavor of that meat absolutely delivers a nice thick and hearty sauce and of course those perfectly al dente noodles underneath there this is a nice combination of course with the breadsticks a nice combo overall definitely recommended on this one and the price isn't bad either you know I've always wanted to give the pasta a shot over here at Pizza Hut and aside from all the promo items that I love to check out over here it's nice to know that this is available year-round and I'm glad that I was finally able to give it a go right now on camera for the very first time in front of all of you so with that said I'm gonna have to give the Tuscani meaty marinara pasta here at Pizza Hut a pretty rock-solid 9 out of 10 now this is by no means the very best meaty marinara sauce I've ever had because naturally when it comes to that for me personally I need to have much thicker pieces of meat in my sauce but when it comes to fast food that easily ranks up there and for $8.99 it's a bangin deal guys and the flavor did deliver so easily I would recommend it to you ok now the obvious question is are you gonna take me up on that offer drop some comments down below have you ever had the pasta over here at Pizza Hut and by the way which do you prefer straight marinara with no meat or meat in it drop those comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K closing out another episode of peep this out bringing you brand new content every single week here on my channel
