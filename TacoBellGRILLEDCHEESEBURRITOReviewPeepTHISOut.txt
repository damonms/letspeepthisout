 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty it's another high quality foodie feature with Ian K here on peep this out reviews back at it once again this time on over at taco bell to go in on what looks to be some pretty tasty looking grilled cheese goodness they've got on the menu right now that's right it's the all-new grilled cheese burrito here at taco bell and as you can see the star of the show is front and center on the outside of a pretty decently sized burrito here guys take a look at that melty goodness right there a combination of cheddar mozzarella and pepper jack coated all along the outside and it's looking really really tasty very inviting on the inside is all the goodness i think that you know from taco bell we've got a burrito filled with seasoned beef seasoned rice nacho cheese sauce reduced fat sour cream a three cheese blend chipotle sauce and red strips but guys again it's the outside that counts on this one as well as the overall flavor of it and i think it's gonna be pretty familiar but let's just see if the flavor is gonna deliver on this one it's the all new grilled cheese burrito here at taco bell let's peep out this flavor well right off the break as soon as i opened up the wrap on this one you can easily smell the cheese on this and i'm getting more of the cheddar and mozzarella blend believe it or not than anything else and naturally with pepper jack this is supposed to be a little bit of spice added to the mix as well but with those three types of cheeses together guys this actually looks really really nice presentation wise it's nice and wet as you guys can see this is just minutes old right now and i'm really digging it and of course on the inside a very familiar looking burrito from taco bell so we are definitely

for you guys here on the channel and of course curiosity's sake i wanted to see how they were going to do the grilled cheese and i've actually got the answer for you as we get further into the review so stay tuned let's give it a shot the grilled cheese burrito brand new here at taco bell oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah all right first things first on this the chipotle sauce is pretty amazing all the same ingredients that you know and love from taco bell it's a classic example of everything they do really really well over here on display inside the burrito the cheese on the outside a nice accent to what i'm getting and it's adding some extra creaminess overall to the equation here so naturally as you can see on the inside again a very familiar build on what you'd find on say the quesarito but with a little bit of the cheesy goodness on the outside so i'm really digging the fact that this is actually flavor-wise on point with what I was expecting but believe it or not the cheddar the mozzarella and the pepper jack not really thinking there's pepper jack really flavor coming through on this it's more of the chipotle sauce that's giving me the spice but guys it's delicious let's keep going this is a pretty nice blend of goodness here and as you guys can see this is completely grilled top to bottom and if you're wondering how they do this believe it or not they sprinkle the cheese on the inside of parchment paper and then they wrap the burrito around it basically dropping it into the grill and pressing it like they would normally that's what's giving you the grill marks that you're getting on the outside here but it also melts the cheese and that actually keeps it from sticking to the actual parchment paper itself because of what it is it's kind of a slippier thicker type of paper but i'm loving the fact that it really keeps the composure of everything together and again the greasiness is there this is a pretty decent amount of cheese it looks kind of thin but at the same time very very flavorful and of course everything on the inside of this with the quesarito insides i should say it's really very similar you know this actually really does feel like a convertible quesarito where you would have the tortilla around the burrito itself with the cheese in between it there's no tortilla on the outside so naturally the parchment paper is taking up the slack for that and giving you that nice cheesy goodness without sticking to anything so i like how they do that i think it's very cool but overall this is really more like a quesadilla 1.5 it's really nothing different compared to that with the exception of the red strips added into the mix with naturally and the cheese here but tasty guys it's exactly what you'd expect it to be but i'm so glad that those three cheeses minus the pepper jack actually is really coming through pretty nicely let's go for another bite so yeah i guess technically it is grilled cheese because they are dropping it onto their grill press and they're doing just that they're pressing it quote-unquote grilling it so naturally with that parchment paper taking up the slack to really keep it from kind of sticking it's kind of cool how they do it actually and you know what i would actually consider this part of the quesarito family which i've actually reviewed many times over the years take a look at the playlist popping up on your screen right now if you want to kind of root around and see what i've done there there's plenty of versions of the quesarito that have come out this is another variation of it but without the quesarito name so i get why that's a separate product line you really don't want to mix it but the fact that you're calling this a grilled cheese burrito is a little bit of a stretch but i like what they're doing here guys but again it's everything you know and love from taco bell on the inside with a pretty decent amount of cheese on the outside and a very cool way to make it with that parchment paper press action there so very very slick overall order ahead and pick yours up at our contactless drive-through so with that said i'm gonna have to give the grilled cheese burrito here a taco bell a pretty decent 8.2 out of 10 they're not reinventing the wheel with this one like i said it's got all the same ingredients that you know and love from taco bell just with the addition of that nice little bit of cheese on the outside there and while the pepper jack was pretty non-existent the spice from the chipotle sauce was pretty nice the red strips on the inside a little on the mushy side even for being a few minutes old but the flavor is definitely there and it's easily worth your time if you're a grilled cheese lover set your expectations accordingly but if you're a taco bell lover you're gonna dig it all right now the obvious question and i think i know the answer to this one are you gonna be giving this one a shot come on you know you're gonna give this one a shot
