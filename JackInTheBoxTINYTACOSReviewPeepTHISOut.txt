 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty hey everyone I'm back at it cheaters cam style after hours here at jack-in-the-box because it looks like one of their most popular menu items just got hit with the shrink ray that's right honey they've shrunk the tacos here at jack-in-the-box feast your eyes on the tiny tacos 15 pieces of miniaturized taco eating goodness fried up to a crispy golden-brown perfect for a late night review and I got to say these look very very appetizing very snackable lemme lift one of these up to show you guys here you can really see the grains of that corn guys this is actually looking really really nice on the inside I actually asked if this was actually beef or chicken and it turns out they said it was chicken so it's really just a little bit of a mixture of spices a little bit of that chicken goodness in there and that's it but 15 pieces they definitely look snackable and for dipping we have got a side of the creamy avocado lime sauce to go with so that should actually pair nicely with that chicken mixture I'm thinking they're the guys again the appearance really really nice and crispy and you can really see it does resemble their classic tacos here pretty well looking to get into these right now to see if the flavor delivers it's the all-new mini tacos late night or any time you want him here at jack-in-the-box let's peep out this flavor yeah I gotta say it's always a blast to review Jack after hours and I think you guys all know I love my cheaters cam format so this really is the perfect time to check these out and with mini tacos no less the iconic version a smaller version I should say of their original classic here how could I not so let's not keep you in suspense too much longer but like always before I get

as soon as brand-new content drops every week guys mini tacos such a blast already here just because of how these look let's give him a shot mmm Wow well it lost a little piece of that tiny taco after that first bite I guess as you can tell these are extremely fried so I really like the fact that the fried goodness is coming through very well the filling on the inside is definitely not beef I'm not getting beef at all with this it tastes more like a bean believe it or not maybe a little bit of chicken is in there but it's very creamy like so I really like the flavor of it the spices are actually pretty nice doesn't have a lot of heat but it's letting me know it's got something extra in it but I love the fried goodness of this guy's this is actually pretty tasty mmm very crunchy too and hey if you're curious about how these make compare to their original tacos the famous tacos here at jack-in-the-box take a look at that review popping up on your screen here right now I had a blast checking those out and while these are nowhere near as good as those believe it or not these are tasty but they're not as good as the regular tacos strictly because that actually had cheese lettuce and some taco sauce in it they're more full-featured but hey I guess you could do a loaded version of this one where they actually top off this 15 piece order with a little bit of that taco sauce cheese and lettuce to simulate the full-featured taco these are more bite size little bits of corn tortilla with a little bit of that mixture on the inside of the chicken I guess this is what it is definitely not beef I'm not getting anything like that but it's creamy and I do like that like I said it is pretty good super fun to eat too as well guys I mean it looks cool in the container and I love the fact that the crispness and the crunchiness is there pretty nice alright let's see what's up with this creamy avocado lime sauce just by the look of it it definitely has some guac in there at least the coloring is very reminiscent about a pale version of it I should say but it is very very creamy and it looks really really inviting of course it's gonna go very nicely on top of the tortilla goodness the fried tortilla goodness I should say of these tiny tacos let's give it a shot mmm Oh strong lime with a little hint of that guacamole avocado feel that's actually really tasty kind of refreshing actually the lime citrusy is coming through nicely mixes very nicely with the mixture in the inside and of course the fried crunchiness well that makes it believe it or not there's a little bit of spice more coming from this then on its own but wow I'm really kind of feeling it in the back it's actually a nice flavor and the overall lime is strong I'm a huge fan of lime and lemon in general but the lime is nice on this mmm oh yeah let me go for one more because this lime sauce is definitely bomb that would love to try this creamy avocado lime unlike a chicken sandwich or a burger I think that would be pretty amazing but with the mixture being chicken on the inside from what I'm told I think that pairs nicely with the avocado lime good choice on this one for sure as a launch sauce and I would love to see this on some other burgers chicken sandwiches really hmm just got such a kick to it I love the refreshingness of it too I'm talking about my mouth full because I'm digging the sauce this is really good so yeah these are pretty much a blast to check out and the fact that I'm doing it after hours like I said I think it's pretty much adding to the experience overall but I love the fried crispy outer coating to the actual shell itself and the mixture on the inside I guess that chicken and bean like mixture that it's got that was very nicely with the creamy avocado lime so definitely thinking the quality of this one and I would easily recommend giving this a shot your first time at night I think it's gonna set the tone for you cheaters cam style if you will I would recommend doing it that way just saying the wait is over try my new tiny tacos 15 for 3 bucks or loaded for 4 bucks so with that said I'm gonna have to give the all-new tiny tacos here at jack-in-the-box a pretty rock-solid 8 out of 10 the only way I can see to improve these is to really add some of the condiments that you can get on the regular tacos themselves a little bit of cheese taco sauce maybe some lettuce given the size of them and given the fact that they're snackable they're meant to be made pretty quickly I can see why they're not gonna do that but as it stands the mixture on the inside is pretty good but like I said I'm glad there's 15 the value is decent $3.49 definitely something to check out you really should they're pretty tasty now of course the question is are you gonna check these out if you've got a jack-in-the-box in the area you're gonna be giving these a shot and if you're a fan of the tacos already how excited are you to give them a shot just based upon that fact alone hey you're gonna do it after hours drop those comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K closing out another episode of peep this out
