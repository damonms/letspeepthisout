 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty hey everyone welcome back to another high quality  foodie feature for you here on the channel where   this time i'm back on over a good old jack in the  box because it looks like a classic menu favorite   is getting a little bit of an upgrade that's  right you already know what it is guys feast your   eyes on the jumbo egg rolls definitely a lovely  situation here guys these are feeling a little   bit more packed than usual and i gotta admit i  am digging the presentation of this one already   so breaking this one down from top to bottom  what we've got here is a nice crispy outer   coating filled with diced pork cabbage celery  carrots onions and spices and apparently it's   got 50% more filling across the board to really  jack this one up just a bit guys and that's   actually a beautiful thing really digging the  overall crispy presentation of this one and they   really feel kind of hefty in the hand i'm really  digging that already and of course with this being   egg rolls you got to have something to dip into  them with and guys here we have their sweet and   sour sauce get your tang on i can't wait to get  into this guys and considering the heftiness of   these egg rolls already i'm thinking this is going  to be a pretty lovely situation yeah definitely a   lovely situation just look at the crispiness of  that outer coating guys it almost feels like a   wonton type shell on this fried to perfection a  very lovely thing indeed so let's not waste any   more time on this one it's the all new jumbo  egg rolls here at jack-in-the-box let's do it   crunchy and loaded oh yeah this  is definitely got some more in it   yeah let me get you right up on this one right  away because after that first bite you can see   everything loaded on the inside of this guys  a very generous portion of the diced pork that   cabbage the celery the carrots the onions  the spices a nice situation of course the   crispiness of that outer shell is pretty banging  these really feel more substantial and i gotta   say i'm taking this already really solid yeah  you're definitely gonna hear me talking about   me digging this one all throughout the review  guys because the iconic flavor of the egg rolls   over a jack are iconic for a reason and i have to  admit the quality of what you're getting with this   is only amped that much further with that much  more filling on the inside let's keep going in you know i gotta say this is totally taking  me back to the first time i reviewed these   around this time last year so take a look at that  review popping up on your screen here right now   and consider this one kind of like the addendum to  that because what you're getting is the exact same   experience with just more of it on the inside and  let me also say i think i made the right call by   going for a three piece because just a single  version of these new upgraded egg rolls are   actually $2.49 three of them $4.39 guys so this is  about 40 cents more expensive than the first time   that i did the last time i think it was a three  piece that i did back then as well for about four   bucks so guys a very sizable upgrade for very  little on top of that premium price point from   before because considering what this is for fast  food like i said i think it warrants that guys and   again the crispiness of the outside is totally  banging on this just super delicious all across   the board and honestly we have to go in on some of  the sweet and sour sauce guys so we are absolutely   gonna get our tang on here let me  crack this open and then we'll go for a dunk   yeah definitely some sweetness coming  my way with this one guys here we go   close up for you as always let's give  this a shot nice little dunk action   very thick i'm expecting the tang to be there  maybe a little orange flavor let's give this a go   ultra sweet fast food chinese food sauce basically  but it goes amazing with the extra filling on the   inside and guys again look at that absolutely  loaded with the good stuff nice and crispy all   around let's go for it again here this is very  very awesome right now mmm really really good oh yeah you can't just get one of these for $2.50  you got to do the $4.39 route get the three piece   highly worth your time so yeah guys just a little  quickie addendum to my original review from back   then let me pick up another one of these here just  to show you but man they are really really solid   they really feel more substantially packed and i  gotta say i am digging it digging it digging it   three times over with all the good stuff on the  inside a beautiful situation packed with the   goodness and if you guys have a jack in the area  this is a no-brainer get these jumbo egg rolls   they're pretty banging order on ubereats postmates  and grubhub you know i'm trying to think back and   if memory serves me correctly i think i gave the  jack-in-the-box egg rolls the standard version   about a year ago this time i think it was a 9 out  of 10 that i gave him then because the quality was   pretty awesome so that's exactly what i'm having  right now a lot more of the same quality but a   much more banging version of it because there's  so much more on the inside so if i did give it a   9 which i'm thinking that i did you guys are  probably gonna let me know down below if i did   that or not i'm gonna have to give the all new  jumbo egg roll versions over here at jack in the   box are pretty rock solid 10 out of 10 because  guys it's more of what the goodness already is   just on a beefed up scale so to speak the pork  is awesome along with the crispiness of the outer   coating and everything else on the inside of that  and when you pair that up with the sweet and sour   sauce when getting your tang on is definitely  in order it does a great job of satisfying guys   and again the quality 40 cents more than what  i remember reviewing last year how could you   not get the three piece pretty bang all right so  aside from confirming down below if i actually did   give these a 9 the last time which i'm willing to  bet i probably did are you personally going to be   giving this one a shot do you guys have jack in  the box in the area and if you do are egg rolls   one of your favorite things on the menu drop some  comments down below and definitely let me know   and with that this is Ian K closing out another  high quality foodie feature for you here on peep   this out reviews bringing you brand new content  every single week here on my channel so while you stay   tuned for that next review coming real soon in the  meantime stay frosty all day long with this one   guys and it's even more of a
