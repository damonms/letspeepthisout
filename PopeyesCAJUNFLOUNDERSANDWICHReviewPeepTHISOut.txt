thank you great thanks so much all  right so as many of you guys know i'm not   really a super fan of fast food fish  but this actually really feels like a   truly different type of fast food fish here's  hoping it's going to be good hey how you doing okay no worries no worries there have you tried  this new cajun flounder is it pretty good looks   pretty it's kind of like the chicken sandwich  are kind of sizable nice nice excited awesome uh it comes with tartar sauce already right  tartar sauce pickles and just the fish   oh that's fine that's fine thank you all  right so it looks like it's about 50 cents   more expensive than the chicken sandwich  let's see how this is gonna go awesome thanks   so much stay frosty we'll see ya all right  bye-bye all right guys let's peep this out   you know it's such a beautiful day in southern  cali right now i thought i'd do this review with   some fresh air around me so let's get into  this one guys feast your eyes on the cajun   flounder sandwich here at popeyes and i'm  already digging how sizable the sandwich is   guys this is looking pretty nice starting off  with the basics we've got what looks to be kind   of an oversized brioche style bun toasted with  a little bit of tartar sauce on the top of it   but guys take a look at the fish itself a crispy  piece of flounder and it covers the whole bottom   of this bun looking pretty nice marinated in  some cajun seasonings and again sizeableness   is definitely there underneath it we've got more  tartar sauce we've got some pickles a couple of   them and they're thick cut looking pretty nice but  again i keep coming back to the size of the fish   this is pretty wide so let's get into this and of  course as you already know this is popeyes so the   crispy goodness is obviously on display for you  guys i am so digging the amount of coating and   just the size of this fish in general and again  it's fast food fish not one of my favorite types   of things to get when i go out but still this is  looking pretty awesome and flounder too i've never   really had this in a fast food form this should be  pretty interesting here we go guys it's the cajun   flounder sandwich brand new here at popeyes  perfect in time for lent let's get it going oh man right off the break the saltiness of the  coating is definitely up there it's a little   bit more elevated but a little bit of heat a  little bit of spiciness coming through again   guys you know what's really setting it off for me  on top of that the pickles these are the pickles   that they use with the chicken sandwich over here  so the thick cut the crunch the snap the acidity is   banging and guys the fish not bad at all fairly  flaky on the inside and again it's a little on the   thin side but it's wide and of course you've  got that brioche bun that they're known for   as well over here but man so far i am digging  this this is pretty banging let's keep going in this doesn't feel like a deep fried fish stick  type of sandwich guys this is pretty legit wow the   fish has almost kind of a creamy type of flavor  to it there but again the saltiness of the coating   is kind of mixing with that so you're getting a  nice flavor overall with it and again the cajun   spices a little bit of the sizzle in the back  of my throat here right now it's nothing crazy   but the quality is nice and again the dovetail in with the tartar sauce and the pickle together   pretty banging i kind of wish i had just a  little bit more tartar sauce on this to be honest   doesn't really seem like there's a lot but the  showcase of the patty is definitely on display   guys and again like i said it's popeye's crispy  goodness all around this so far i am really really   enjoying the softness of that brioche bun the  nice shininess of it as well let's keep going in this is so good and again coming from someone who  doesn't like fast food fish this is definitely   something i'm going to be getting i think  throughout the season of lent here at popeyes   and again it's a nice testament to the quality  of what you're getting in terms of the coating   the breading it's classic popeyes the cajun  seasoning but the fish itself although it's   not quite super thick it's sizeable because  it's wide and it's definitely worth the money   i think for what you're getting here guys just  a couple of bites in two or three in look at the   size of this in my hand still not bad for $4.49  honestly i'm going to keep going in let's do it hmm and coming back to the actual fish itself  the flounder really is not reminiscent of like   alaskan pollock it's got a very distinct type of  flavor like i said a little bit more creamy to me   for some reason but at the same time the flakiness  is there and the overall robustness of that flavor   is coming through on top of the coating and the  light seasoning that i'm getting which is kind   of giving me some of the spicing but guys again  it's not going to blow your socks off here but if   i can just show this to you again take a look at  the actual patty there you can kind of see around   the fish itself inside the coating you can kind of  see where the fish and the coating separate you're   getting a little bit of red action in there that's  that seasoning that you're going to get the cajun   goodness in but again the flakiness of the fish  is good but the overall quality of the flounder   is definitely standing out to me like i said this  doesn't feel like a generic fish stick sandwich   or alaskan pollock or whatever generic fishes they  use for fast food this is really pretty nice guys   and again very reminiscent of the quality over  here at popeyes because of the cajun goodness   to go with it there so pretty cool guys pretty  cool and on the real i was kind of hoping this   was going to be good considering the quality  of the chicken sandwich in general so you're   getting the same pickles with this one on top of  the tartar sauce and obviously the fish because   those two go together i probably could have  gotten some cocktail sauce to go with when   i was asked in the drive-thru but i'm glad i'm  doing it solo dolo like this guys because honestly   this is really all you need i only wish like i  said i had just a little bit more tartar sauce to   go with but it's a pretty banging fish sandwich  and for fast food i'm digging it absolutely   all right so one more bite and we'll finish this  one up after the rating but guys i'm super glad to   have checked this one out over here at popeyes  right now and again for the season of lent   you've got another pretty awesome choice that's  truly different i think because i don't know any   other place that offers flounder at least for fast  food that's pretty good let's go in for one more   all right so let's go around the world with  this one and as you guys can see there is a lot   of fish in the sandwich for the money guys and  i'm so glad about that i'm glad that it's not   just super small but thick but it's wide and a  little bit more sizable like i said when you're   putting it in your hands but as you can see the  crispy goodness is on display tartar sauce the   pickles definitely on this one light this one  up and obviously with that brioche style bun   nice softness the pillowy goodness to actually  put this one together and get it into your face   but pretty nice and again the shininess i'm  definitely digging definitely a delicious fish   sandwich guys especially for fast food so with  that said i'm gonna have to give the all-new   cajun flounder sandwich here at popeye's a rock  solid 9 out of 10 now keep in mind i wish   i had just a little bit more tartar sauce like i  mentioned a couple of times throughout the review   but that's not gonna deter the fact that the  quality of the flounder was definitely up there   that light flakiness that it's got the creaminess  and just the overall flavor of it in general   mix so well with the cajun seasoning in the  coating itself and guys of course the pickles   that they use in the chicken sandwich here are  on display for you as well thick crunchy very   very nice they delivered that extra crunch  i really love that and the fact that you're   getting that soft brioche bun again just a great  delivery mechanism to get that into your face guys   definitely a delicious fast food fish sandwich  coming from someone who doesn't like fast food   fish i think that says something right all right  so i've got two simple questions for you first   if you've made it this far into the review chances  are you're a fan of fish sandwiches and if you are   who do you think has the best fish sandwich fast  food wise and second are you going to be giving   this one a shot drop
