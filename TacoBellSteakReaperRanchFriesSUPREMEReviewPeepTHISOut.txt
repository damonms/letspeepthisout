 hey everyone I'm back at it this time headed into taco bell since it looks like they're introducing some new fast food heat as part of their latest promo so let's see what it's all about after we set ourselves up to that drive-thru welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty yeah peep this out can I go for an order of those steak Reaper Ranch fries with easy tomato and that's it you got it okay great thanks a lot so how much bite are these new reaper ranch fries gonna have compared to the rattlesnake fries that I reviewed a couple of months back we're about to find out thank you awesome thanks thanks so much my friend stay frosty we'll see ya buh bye alright guys let's peep this out so here we go with the all-new steak Reaper Ranch fries supreme and initial first impressions a little underwhelming guys I have to admit this doesn't look like it's worth $3.99 if you ask me it's a little on the small side but starting off on the very bottom the base of course the nacho fries a very popular item here at Taco Bell all those bold Mexican spices that they're known for very tasty item we've got some nacho cheese sauce some reduced fat sour cream some diced tomatoes of course you've got some steak in there as well just an okay amount actually but the main draw with this one is the special sauce this one has got here the new Reaper ranch sauce featuring a combination of ranch and Carolina Reaper pepper mixed together so a little bit of heat coming my way hopefully a little bit more than usual but again the presentation on this one it's a simple build but for $3.99 I'm not really feeling it guys I got to be honest it's a little pricey and there's really not a lot here but let's get into it and see how awesome this is this is the all-new steak Reaper Ranch fries supreme here at Taco Bell let's peep out this flavor so are you a fan of high quality delicious looking food reviews well if so definitely hit that subscribe button down below and don't forget to tap that Bell icon so you could be notified as soon as new content drops every week so let's dive into this one FYI for those of you who don't know I'm based in Southern California so automatically we're already paying just a little bit more for some of the things that you'd be able to find around the country maybe just a little bit less so it is what it is I have to admit when I'm seeing what I'm seeing here for four bucks it's already a sad situation for something that's supposed to be a supreme there's not even refried beans on this guy's so this already feels like I'm being ripped off in general I hope the flavors gonna make up for it so let me just give it a go and grab a little bit of that Reaper sauce and some of the fries a little bit of everything here actually guys like I said it's a very simple bill but there's really not too much to it for four bucks here we go it's the steak Reaper Ranch fries supreme supreme here at Taco Bell it's a little elevated a little heated but nothing crazy you got a little bit more here actually it's actually more of a sizzle on the back end but that is actually not too crazy I guess I'm having a little bit of a sour cream going with it there's kind of muting a little bit go for it again I like it it's almost like a Tabasco type of sauce to me actually with a little bit of extra heat to it there but nothing crazy I mean it's fast food heat it's not gonna be like killing me completely although I have had stuff in the past that has really done it to me in the past this so far is just okay you know as I'm getting further into this one I'm noticing I don't really have a lot of that Reaper ranch sauce guys that's a little disappointing again on top of everything else that I'm experiencing with this right now the nacho cheese sauce is very tasty of course the fries themselves are very good and the combination of the sour cream is very nice as well it adds a nice coolness to it and the steak is fairly tasty as well but overall the main star of the show is not really standing out too much for me guys and there's just not a lot of it to speak of you know I had some really high hopes for this one because of the whole Reaper theme with this one naturally I was expecting some really threatening heat and while it is a little bit of elevated goodness here it's nothing really crazy that I haven't had in the past when Taco Bell before the habanero stuff was really good of course the rattlesnake fries are pretty good as well this is just a marketing thing mostly to me guys and I have to admit again had I had a little bit more of their Reaper Ranch sauce to speak of it would have been a little bit better but as it stands it's just like a regular nachos supreme with the fries with a little bit of heat to it that's pretty much it and hey it's tasty and I think it really could have benefited by having a little refried beans and some shredded cheese on top of everything else just to give that supreme name something a little bit more to stand out with but as it stands it's just another variation of these nacho fries with some toppings and naturally some marketing to go with guys like I said that's pretty much it let me give you a quickie final shot of what I think is probably one of the better things on this the Reaper ranch sauce what little I do have of it goes very nicely with the steak itself here and I'm really a fan of the combination of those two together I wish I had a little bit more of each I wish the price was a little bit less and like I said an additional topping or two would have really benefited this one greatly but as it stands it's just alright I know I'm beating this one to death just a bit here guys but it's truly just that alright I mean it's the basic nacho fries that you know from Taco Bell with the cheese sauce that's really the main component of it there which really stands out with a little bit of extra heat that I'm getting from the quote-unquote Reaper ranch sauce which really doesn't feel any more elevated than any other type of spicy sauce they've had in the past again really slick marketing but that's pretty much it for me so with that said I'm gonna have to give the steak Reaper ranch fries supreme adjust above average 6 out of 10 and I really can't go much higher than that because the flavors like I said are very familiar the only downside for me with this obviously aside from the price was the lack of the Reaper ranch sauce I really needed a lot more of that on there just to make it worth it I think that would have been great what are you gonna do though right well I know what I'm gonna do right now I'm gonna ask you if you're gonna give these a shot drop some comments down below are you excited to give the steak Reaper ranch fries supreme a shot over here at Taco Bell and if you are are you gonna be trying the burrito version of it as well drop those comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this
