 hey everyone I'm back at it this time over at Wendy's yet again because after checking out their breakfast Baconator and vanilla frosty-ccino recently I saw something else on the menu that I definitely had to check out and that's the maple bacon chicken croissant so stay tuned because it's up next welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty so are you up for this well you absolutely know I am feast your eyes on the maple bacon chicken croissant and already that maple butter is lighting up my car pretty ridiculously right now guys it smells like very strong maple syrup and I absolutely love it it's really really awesome starting off from the very top here we've got a very flaky looking croissant bun this is really nice nice and warm take a look underneath this one looks like we've got their legendary applewood smoked bacon nice and toasty here and again that syrup like butter is really really strong you can kind of see it in the very top of the chicken there guys looking nice speaking of that chicken it's a semi small type of chicken breast here guys this is not really super super big and me see if I can move some of the bacon out of the way here but that maple butter is very very strong and I can't stop talking about it because it really smells fantastic underneath it looks like we've got just the bottom of the bun and overall there's a nice shot of that chicken as well breaded up juicy definitely looking pretty good a little on the small side I have to admit but with the applewood smoked bacon goodness on this one I think the flavor is gonna deliver guys this really smells great I can't stop talking about it because it's just so strong so let's see if the flavors gonna deliver on this one for sure it's the maple bacon chicken croissant here at Wendy's as part of their all-new breakfast menu line up let's peep out this flavor the clown is not going to be happy yeah this sure is screaming breakfast in my car right now with the smell of that maple butter guys and speaking of screaming breakfast there's actually something I'm gonna be checking out on the bonus footage of this video at the very end it's doing the same thing right now so I'm gonna try and get through this because I definitely want to get into that as well so sit tight you're gonna want to check that out all right so let's get into this one but real quick and like always if you guys are fans of high quality delicious looking food reviews make sure to hit that subscribe button down below and don't forget to tap the Bell icon so you can be notified as soon as brand new content drops every week here we go it's the maple bacon chicken croissant brand-new here at Wendy's let's do it mmm maple is not disappointing mmm Wow alright first off the nice soft flakiness of that buttery croissant is coming through and it's thanks in part mostly because of the maple butter that this has got going on it and then right into the chicken guys which admittedly is a little on the small side but it is very very flavorful because it is small it's just a little on the drier side as well so the moisture that I'm getting from that maple butter is really helping in that department but of course the applewood smoked bacon is a major highlight on this one as it always is here at Wendy's let's go for another bite I'll give you another close-up but guys so far very tasty for a chicken sandwich in the morning with some awesome maple goodness let's keep going so as you can see it's pretty decent I'd probably say this one is about half of the chicken breast that you normally get on there lunch sandwiches guys but as you can see here it's definitely solid all white meat and that is a major plus right there the applewood smoked bacon is amazing and again the maple butter is really singing on this one and then naturally you've got that buttery croissant bun that this has here as well just a nice simple breakfast sandwich but I got to say that crispy applewood smoked bacon that Wendy's is known for goes amazingly well with that maple butter it really is a nice combo but let me also say aside from all that are the good stuff the quality of the croissant bun here guys is really nice I like how it's nice and toasted on the inside its got like a flaky butteriness to it and overall it adds to the experience I think had to spit on just like a regular bun it wouldn't be as good even with that maple butter I think that's gonna save the day regardless but I love the combination of everything in this one in particular because guys I do like croissants on their own so this is a nice combination but again it feels like a little bit more like a glorified slider and the price is just a little up there for what you're getting here but the flavor is pretty bomb let's go for another bite on this one we'll wrap it up with the rating and finish this one out all right let's do a little 360 on this one and as if you couldn't tell already guys the maple butter itself and that applewood smoked bacon is really saving the day with this one aside from the light dryness of the chicken itself the overall quality of this one is really up there I'm definitely digging the toastiness of that croissant bun and overall the combination works extremely well especially if you like chicken in the morning this is pretty awesome but as you can see solid white meat and an easy recommendation to give a try guys just nice quality all around so with that said I'm gonna have to give the maple bacon chicken croissant as part of the all-new breakfast menu here at Wendy's a rock-solid 8 out of 10 the only thing that really hurts this one and like I mentioned throughout this review is really the size of it and the price point the quality is high don't get me wrong but this one's gonna make you wish for a bigger sandwich overall and theoretically you could buy two of these things but again at the price point for what I'm starting out at $4.39 it's gonna be up there in terms of the cost but overall quality is high I would recommend it and like I said that maple butter with the applewood smoked bacon is awesome but of course the obvious question at least to me anyway is if this look pretty awesome to you drop some comments down below what did you think of the overall presentation of this one and overall how excited are you for the all-new breakfast menu here at Wendy's drop those comments down below definitely let me know and with that this is the Ian K closing out another episode of peep this out bringing you brand new content every single week here on my channel so while you stay tuned for that next review coming real soon in the meantime stay frosty whoa whoa whoa but how could I really close this one out without first going in on their seasoned potatoes guys they actually threw this one in the bag for me and I'm absolutely loving the presentation so far so let's give this one a shot real quick to see if they deliver yeah so these seasoned potatoes are absolutely lighting up my car almost as much as that maple butter right now so this is totally a breakfast situation this morning as it should be because that's what I'm reviewing right now breakfast items but I love the overall aroma of everything in my car right now guys maple butter fried heavenly goodness I'm hoping with these it just smells pretty awesome so let's give these seasoned potatoes a shot definitely diggin how nice and seasoned they look little wedge shaped it looks like they have the natural cut skin on the outside so it's a nice combination of natural style as well as seasoned and I'm definitely a fan of the natural cut sea salt fries at Wendy's here anyway so I'm thinking this is gonna be similar let's give it a shot very similar that's actually really tasty yeah these are pretty good the salt is actually not too bad I don't really like a lot of salt on my fries so this is actually really good as little hints of that but nice seasoning and the fried goodness is coming through oh yeah not bad not bad at all doesn't really need ketchup or anything either they're not too thin they're not too thick with just the right amount of crispiness on the outside and some pretty smooth rich potato in the middle so I'm digging that and again not very salty which is awesome so a little bit of the pepper that I'm getting on this one too it's not too bad no real heat or just overall fried tasty potato like wedges in mini form to go with your breakfast sandwich so I'm not gonna rate these because I did get these for free right now but overall not bad guys obviously if your getting the combo this is a pretty nice addition to go with it there regardless of whatever drink you get to go with that but I'm definitely thinking the quality of this one I'm gonna knock off some more of these as well as finish out that maple bacon chicken croissant and I'll definitely catch you guys soon but so far Wendy's is doing it for breakfast guys pretty awesome mmm good stuff I'll see ya but hey real quick before you go in just in case you haven't already take a look at the last review that I put out right up over here along with what I think YouTube's gonna recommend for you to check out as well as always I think you'll find something like in both of them and I'll definitely catch ya in the next one see ya
