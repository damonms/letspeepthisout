 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty BK literally does the impossible by bringing the popular impossible burger to their iconic whopper but is it enough to make you forget about beef all together well I'm about to find out right now so let's go in on the impossible whopper and as you guys can see I decided to go with the double variant of it guys strictly because I wanted to simulate that double whopper experience but as always you've got that sesame seed bun on top let's pop it and take a look underneath you guys are gonna find lots of the original whopper ingredients naturally plenty of chopped lettuce we've got some light Mayo looks like we've got some Tomatoes you've got some pickles we've got some onions in there we've got some ketchup and then if you look underneath that we've got two patties of that goodness which should make it a little bit easier for me to split so you guys can take a look and check out the grill marks on this one guys 100% plant-based the impossible burger this is 2.0 on the recipe of it so they replaced the wheat protein with soy and that basically it's looking pretty much like a beef patty you guys it looks fairly decent and I'm really diggin the grill marks on the bottom here and speaking of the bottom it looks like we have got just the bun so two patties of the goodness here and it definitely looks the part I have to say it's mimicking the look of beef pretty nicely flame-grilled goodness on this one let's see if the flavor delivers on it though it's the impossible whopper a brand new here at BK let's peep out this flavor so are you a fan of high quality delicious looking food reviews well if so definitely hit that subscribe button down below don't forget to tap that Bell icon so you could be notified as soon as new content drops every week now let's dive into this one you know I'm really glad I got the double because not only does it look pretty awesome in my opinion it's actually got the heft and feel of an actual double whopper guys so here we go it's the impossible whopper and then some here at BK well right off the break I am getting some pretty decent flame grill flavor from the process here at BK that they used to make their beef but I have to admit by getting the double version it is standing out a little bit more that it doesn't really feel like a beef burger it really feels like it's an alternative and that's not necessarily a bad thing but the toppings do add to the overall experience the overall bun it does feel like I'm eating a whopper but it is noticeably different let's go for another bite and I'll give you that close up well I got to say this sure looks like a double whopper to me with that impossible burger really mimicking that flame grilled beef here at BK very nicely in addition to the toppings of the whopper guys the appearance just looks pretty spot-on not bad at all yeah the toppings are definitely adding to this one overall as they should because they are the signature flavors on top of the flame grilled beef that the whopper is known for so I'm digging what this is believe me I do like the idea of having something in addition to beef that's very similar and obviously it's a little bit better for you naturally as well it is gluten-free because they are using soy instead of wheat now and the texture while not quite up there with beef is still very enjoyable guys it's still a pretty tasty sandwich for sure well I can see why there's a lot of hype surrounding this one considering how all the toppings do interact very nicely with the quality of the impossible burger it does mimic a burger pretty nicely in that regard and while not quite exactly tasting like a whopper it's a great alternative with just a little hints of what the whopper is but hey guys it's great to have choice right and this is a pretty solid one well this was pretty fun to check out because naturally I am a super fan of the whopper in general here at BK I mean it's an iconic burger I've had it ever since I was a kid and this version of it while it is just a little bit different the flavor Department does check off the boxes on what a whopper should have with the exception of the beef itself not quite being there literally zero beef guys zero beef and that's a good thing because this alternative I do believe is a very good one for you there it's naturally easier to break down in your body and considering the ingredients that it's got as well it's not too horrible for you either a word to the wise though if you do get the double version like I did right now you're probably gonna notice more of a difference in taste as opposed to the single version that they advertised and that's obviously because there's more of that plant-based patty to go in on so keep that in mind because it will change the flavor slightly and you're probably gonna notice that it's not really beef at all still tasty though so with that said I'm gonna have to give the impossible whopper at least a double version that I reviewed right now a pretty decent 8 out of 10 like I said the quality of that impossible burger is pretty high guys the flavor is decent on it and while the texture itself is not quite as firm as beef or as juicy as beef the quality of what I'm chewing here along with all the other toppings on the whopper does make for a pretty nice alternative to the standard whopper itself and like I've always said choice is good isn't it so drop some comments down below and let me know if you're gonna try this one out the next time you hit up BK and also more importantly what do you guys think of these plant-based alternatives to standard beef drop those comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K closing out another
