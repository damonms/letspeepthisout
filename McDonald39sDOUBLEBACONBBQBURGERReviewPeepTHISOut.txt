 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty looks like McDonald's is going a little more traditional with their latest burger promo this time out and hey that's not necessarily a bad thing so let's go in on it it's the bacon BBQ burger and the initial first impressions very beefy as it should be guys because we're doing the double variant today so I definitely wanted to go big on this one there but a nice presentation so far it's definitely pretty tall in the inside of the carton here it's pop the top looks like we have got a toasted bun some onion strings looks like we've got some of that tangy barbecue sauce here a decent amount of applewood smoked bacon and of course looks like a couple of slices of cheese and that's all included with a half pound of beef before cooking guys to quarter pound patties here freshly made definitely very very nice situation let's crack this in the middle here cheesy goodness guys all the goodness as you can see here looking really really tasty and definitely very appetizing let's take a look on the bottom here and it looks like there is nothing so it probably would've benefited by a little bit more barbecue sauce on this one because it looks like it's a little light right there but guys very very nice I love the fried goodness there you've got to have those onion strings with barbecue sauce definitely nice let's see how the flavor is gonna be on this one it's the bacon barbecue burger the double variant here at McDonald's let's peep out this flavor yeah definitely a very meaty beefy situation on this one guys and at almost 8 bucks it better be I mean it's the double right so let's get into this right now but like always first thing if you guys are fans of high quality delicious looking food reviews make sure to

McDonald's let's do it oh my god oh my god alright first off let me just say if you don't do the double patty version of this burger you are seriously missing out and if you really want my honest opinion I don't think they should give you an option you should be having the double just as it is because guys the fresh beef is insane on this with a half pound of it before cooking it is so robust so flavorful and dripping with the goodness combine that with a nice hickory smoked flavor of the actual applewood smoked bacon and the crispiness of those onion strings and it is off the chart guys I'm not really tasting the barbecue sauce believe it or not considering there's like a little bit on here anyway I'm not minding it at all because the flavor of that beef with the bacon the cheese the crispy onions I'm going in again and you're definitely going for that close up this is pretty awesome right now mmm I firmly believe the fresh patties really make a difference with this one guys and when you have a half pound of that goodness to go with everything else on the sandwich you can obviously tell it is really really something special right now especially if you're a fan of bacon and I think most of you guys are of course you've got those crispy onion strings in there as well but as you can see very thick very hearty and this is absolutely an appetite destroyer pretty awesome so far but unfortunately for me right now I really don't have too much barbecue sauce to speak of on here so nothing is really standing out above and beyond the bacon the cheese and the crispiness of the onions and the juiciness of those patties so in that regard I don't mind it whatsoever but honestly it's a bacon barbecue burger I really want to taste a little bit more than barbecue lemme see if I can just taste the sauce by itself real quick here it's a Hickory type of sauce I mean it's not bad but it's not super strong and when you have this much bacon and this much crispy onion goodness to go with the beef and everything else on this it's really kind of getting drowned out believe it or not but nonetheless with the juiciness of the half pound of beef on this right now I don't think you're gonna mind it too much even if you do get just a little bit of the barbecue sauce guys everything else is so flavorful on this that it is just insane and again it's bacon how could you not enjoy bacon on a burger especially with cheese right let's go for one more bite of them a wrap this one up with the rating to close this one out traditional or not it's everything McDonald's does extremely well with their beef and the cheese here guys and when you add that applewood smoked bacon of course the crispy onions to go with this very nice combination indeed even with just a little bit of barbecue sauce still very delicious and highly recommend it you know you're gonna give this one a shot right yeah this one's pretty ridiculous right now guys let's just get right into that rating overall I'm gonna have to give the bacon barbecue burger brand new here McDonald's a rock-solid 9 out of 10 and I got to be honest the only thing that really hurts this right now is the fact that the barbecue sauce wasn't really there on this burger as much as I would have liked so your prep may vary based upon will you get your burger but let me also address the elephant in the room right now because I got to be honest at $7.49 for this particular burger it's just a little overpriced I mean it's delicious yes I mean I clearly enjoyed it during the filming right now but obviously it almost eight dollars for this it really is just up there in terms of the cost considering it's just a double quarter-pounder with some extra toppings $7 plus is just a little much to ask for this I wouldn't go much above $6 to be honest considering what it is but guys still very flavorful and you know you're gonna give it a shot right so do me a solid right now and drop some comments down below let me know if you're gonna give this one a shot and also what exactly is your favorite burger here at McDonald's is it the Big Mac is that the quarter pounder is it the double quarter-pounder drop those comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K closing out another episode of peep this out bringing you brand new content every single week here on my channel so
