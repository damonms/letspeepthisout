 all right everyone welcome back to another  high quality foodie feature for you here on   the channel where this time i'm back on over at  popeyes to check out the other version of their   blackened chicken sandwich that's hiding out  on their menu so without further ado let's get   into it guys check out the spicy blackened chicken  sandwich and already i'm digging the presentation   strictly because of how tasty this is  looking in that chicken department alone   so let's pop the top of this brioche style bun  and get it going and as you can see we've got   plenty of spicy cajun spread that normally comes  on their crispy chicken sandwich guys but take a   look at what it's sitting on again we've got that  non-battered non-breaded white meat chicken filet   coated in that thin crust of what they say is  spice on spice and while this one's not exactly   covering the width of the bun it's looking  a lot thicker definitely a nice presentation   for sure underneath it looks like we've got a  couple of pickles and plenty more of that spicy   cajun spread guys but again it's all about the  blackened chicken with this along with the spicing   that that has on its own i have a feeling this is  going to be pretty tasty it smells pretty great   so let's see if the flavor is going to deliver  on this one this is the spicy blackened chicken   sandwich here at popeyes let's peep out this  flavor yeah i am not playing around with this one   this one is definitely outfitted with that chicken  sandwich diaper in the back guys because there is   plenty of the spicy cajun spread as you saw and  the juiciness of the blackened chicken in general   is gonna be pretty awesome this is looking  and smelling fantastic guys it really is   so let's get into this to match up the tastiness  of the awesome aroma that i've got in my car right   now guys this is the spicy blackened chicken  sandwich here of popeyes let's do it impressive juicy whoa again wow right off  the break i've got a lot of heat   in my mouth right now guys that  spicy cajun spread is elevated   because of the spice that's on the chicken  itself it's more apparent with this and i got   to tell you thankfully the pickle snap is there  it's giving me a little bit more extra to it   but pickle juice heat juicy chicken and a soft bun  sign me up let's keep going this is pretty good while this appears to be lacking in the width  of the chicken itself it's definitely got the   thickness right there in the middle guys this  is actually very hearty because of that and i   gotta say the heat is really elevated on this  the spicing that they coat this with before   they fry it up you can easily tell it's being  elevated because of the spicy cajun sauce that's   on here anyway but that combination is awesome  with the pickles guys very delicious on this   yeah i had a feeling i was gonna like this version  of the blackened chicken sandwich compared to the   one that i just did recently which guys although  that one was pretty delicious as you're seeing   popping up on your screen here right now it looked  pretty fantastic as good as that one definitely is   that spicy cajun spread that's on these chicken  sandwiches of popeyes for the regular breaded   version this is definitely the one to go with  especially if you like heat you're gonna like this   one a lot because of the coating on the outside  of the chicken and that spread let's keep going   in guys this is really good excellent oh hey real  quick before i get further into this one let me   remind you guys if you've already seen my original  review of the classic blackened chicken sandwich   over here at popeyes just like the spicy variant  this is actually available in the app it's kind of   just hiding at the very bottom of the chicken  sandwich menu so take a look on your device   and if you've got this available to you i'd highly  recommend you give it a shot guys it's made to   order because of what it is naturally and i gotta  say it's a great alternative already and i'm   telling you i can easily see myself getting the  spicy variant in addition to the regular chicken   sandwich that i usually get which is spicy anyway  it's really the same thing it's just this one has   no clothes on it whatsoever pretty tasty stuff  let's go for a couple more bites guys pretty good   outstanding i'm so digging the right  blend of saltiness that this actually   has on it guys because technically it does have  a coating with the spices that it's actually in   but when you mix that with the pickles and that  spicy cajun spread it's a lovely situation and   you know what it's actually made better now that  i'm actually using the chicken diaper that this   comes with because there's a lot of stuff leaking  out the back of this one guys there's no shortage   of the amount of sauce on this in addition to the  juiciness of the chicken itself it's just overall   a banging alternative on the menu over here at  popeyes all right so let's go for one more bite   in this one because i think you get the point by  now this is probably going to be the variant you   want to start with and then go backwards from this  point because guys like i said the spicy cajun   spread is a banger over here at popeyes with their  chicken sandwich one more bite and we'll close it up   tasty well if you want options you definitely  have them on the menu over here at popeyes now   especially when you have a breaded version and  a non-breaded aka naked variant as well guys   this is really a nice option to have on the menu  and like i said the juiciness is still on point   the flavors that you're going to know from popeyes  in general are going to be the same but it's   such a different chicken eating experience  but a fun one at that as well pretty tasty   so with that said i'm going to have to give  the spicy blackened chicken sandwich here at   popeyes a pretty awesome 9.5 out of  10 guys the flavor really delivered on this one   across the board and while it wasn't breaded  naturally because it's quote unquote naked   it really delivered in the flavor category because  the spicing was done very well very similar to   the blackened tenders that i reviewed a while  back which you're probably seeing jumping up on   your screen here right now but aside from all that  goodness the bun itself was cracking just a little   too much from my liking there although it was  still kind of fresh it was kind of falling apart   just a little bit more than i'm used to over here  at popeyes but even still what you're getting is a   delicious piece of chicken with the deli pickles  that you know and love and that awesome spicy   cajun spread i gotta say guys really makes this  one even with the addition of the spice on the   chicken gotta say very delicious stuff all right  so just like i asked in my last review on the   classic variant of this blackened chicken sandwich  do you actually have this available in the popeyes   app are you seeing it in your device as something  that you can order drop some comments down below   and let me know if you've actually got it as well  as if you're going to be giving this one a shot   again make sure you hit up the comment section  down below and make your thoughts known i'm   very curious to hear what you have to say about  this one and with that this is Ian K closing out   another high quality foodie feature for you here  on peep this out reviews bringing you brand new   content every single week here on my channel so  while you stay tuned for that next review coming   real soon in the meantime stay frosty yeah you  can't fade the spicy cajun spread on these chicken   sandwiches here at popeyes with or without clothes  it is absolutely a banging situation all right   everyone until next time i'll talk to you soon hey  thanks for checking out another one of my reviews   but just in case you didn't
