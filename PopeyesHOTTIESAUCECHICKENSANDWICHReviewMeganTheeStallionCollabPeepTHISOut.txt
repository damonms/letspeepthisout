 i'm coming for you what's going on everyone and welcome back  to another high quality foodie feature for   you here on the channel we this time over at  popeyes check out their new collabo with rap   artist megan thee stallion that's right and we're  getting hottie with it too so stay tuned because   the hottie chicken sandwich is up next welcome  to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty so megan thee stallion is popping off over here at  popeyes with our all-new hottie chicken sandwich   featuring her hottie sauce and guys already  this is looking pretty nice in the presentation   department already starting off right because  it's a chicken sandwich from popeye's this is   looking pretty good and the size of that chicken  in the middle is absolutely sizeable as expected   alright so let's pop the top of that familiar  buttery brioche bun and take a look underneath   it and what you're gonna see is that classic  popeye's goodness a solid piece of white meat   chicken breast fried up to a crispy golden  brown and it looks absolutely fantastic   and on top of it is the star of the show the  hottie sauce a combination of aleppo pepper cider   vinegar and honey and i gotta say it's giving  this one a nice red tinge with little specks of   peppery goodness on the top of it here if you look  closely it's looking pretty nice guys and again   it's adding a very nice color contrast to the  brown of the fried goodness that it's sitting on   underneath it we've got a couple of their classic  thick cut pickles a very lovely situation there   but no other hottie sauce to speak of so this one  looks a little front loaded on the very top but   even still the chicken is looking awesome and  hey just to be on the safe side just in case   there wasn't enough hottie sauce in this sandwich  i actually got one on the side here just to kind   of have as a keepsake as well guys but obviously i  think i'm not gonna need it considering the amount   that's on the very top of this it's looking pretty  great so let's see if it tastes just as great this   is the all new hottie chicken sandwich featuring  megan thee stallion's hottie sauce here at popeyes   let's peep out this flavor we about to go stallion  mode hold on folks well there's a reason why this   is the number one chicken sandwich in the industry  guys when it comes to fast food just look at the   size of the chicken breasts on this guys and  the pickles everything about this is very high   quality and actually when you're having some hot  sauce action to go with i'm surprised they waited   this long but hey they actually got somebody to  go in with them and megan thee stallion obviously   is that individual so i can't wait to see if  this is going to be as amazing as it looks it   really looks pretty awesome and we're not waiting  any further here we go with the hottie chicken   sandwich here at popeyes featuring of course  the megan thee stallion hot sauce let's do it hmm sweet all right there it is i was waiting for  a second or two it's a little bit of a sizzle i   mean nothing crazy but it definitely feels like  it's got a little bit of heat in the background   there nothing to kind of melt your face off or  anything like that but the sizzle is absolutely   there let's keep going in guys so far it's sweet  with a little bit of sizzle well the honey is   very apparent in this one because that's where the  sweetness is coming from but when it comes to the   aleppo pepper and the cider vinegar i'm not really  getting too much heat from this it's just a little   bit of a sizzle in the background and believe it  or not it's very reminiscent of their sweet heat   sauce that they have here i don't want to say it's  a rebranded version of that because it is using   a different pepper but at the same time it's a  little watered down so it's not really creamy not   really thick like that but it is adding some nice  flavor overall yeah i'm already kind of missing   the spicy mayo on this one guys because i think it  had a little bit more consistency in terms of the   overall flavor of that because of the creaminess  on top of the crispiness of this it's a little bit   more of a watered down syrupy type of sauce which  is fine but the heat is not really up there so i   don't think you have too much to worry about if  you're concerned about how hot this really is i   think it's more of the marketing thing to go with  it with just a little bit of sizzle but even still   it's a popeye's chicken sandwich it bangs in terms  of the meat quantity the pickles are amazing on it   and again with the softness of the brioche bun  here as well a very lovely situation not bad for   a small up charge as well too even at $4.49 for this  it's still a pretty good value let's keep going in i'm kind of getting a slight sweet and sour vibe  from this and i think obviously that's where the   vinegar is coming from as well as the sweetness  of the honey and a little bit of the sizzle i   guess from the actual aleppo pepper but even still  very nice combination of flavors with this and it   does soak up the nooks and crannies of the chicken  itself i mean it's a sizable piece of chicken and   obviously the sauce that they put on the very top  is covering the whole top of it there taking that   into account i don't really need any of the extra  that i got here is the keepsake believe it or not   so i'm actually kind of glad to keep this for  the studio i'm definitely digging how this looks   but i do like the flavor overall it's just  a little bit more of a syrup like situation   for me i don't really kind of prefer that i'm  more of the spicy cajun version the regular   version that they have here but i'm glad to have  tried this naturally because guys like i said   it's a popeye's chicken sandwich there's a  reason why this is number one in the industry   and you already know why i'm just as a basis for  what it is let's go for another couple of bites all right so i just took it out of the chicken  sandwich diaper to give you the 360 on this one   really quick here guys and as you can see it  does fill out the bun pretty nicely the bun is   fairly fresh as well but again the size ability  of the chicken is the major thing with this one   on top of the sauce that they're selling with it  for the collabo but at the same time it's that   classic popeye's goodness with a very nice amount  of heat although just like i said a little bit   more of the sweet heat variety and of course with  the pickles to go with delicious stuff either way   you know on the real even though they're kind  of marketing this as like a new version of their   chicken sandwich with the sauce it's not really  technically a new sandwich to me in terms of just   the way they're marketing this i think they're  really going more for the sauce indirectly   because you can actually put it on the sandwich  it's for the tenders it's for the nuggets i see   what they're doing here i'm still holding out  for a western variant with bacon something   really kind of tailored to really take this up a  notch not just something drizzled on the top but   at the same time the sauce is pretty decent it's  a nice flavor but for me personally i'm more of   the creamier type that i really want to have on  top of this and naturally with this it's just a   little bit more syrupy but even still delicious  stuff all around all right so i think you get   the point by now of how i feel about this one let  me go for one more bite before we close this one   up with the rating coming up next but guys again  another delicious chicken sandwich from popeyes   it's the original chicken sandwich from popeyes  with honestly a little bit of sweet heat action   with some fun marketing with megan  thee stallion even still like i said   still delicious stuff it is what it is  one more bite and we'll close it up hang on well i gotta say when it comes to looks bk is  actually the closest when it comes to actually   looking like the popeye's equivalent guys because  this actually is how chicken sandwiches should be   coming to you especially in the three to four  dollar range this is what you'd expect to find   and popeye's is definitely nailing it  still in the industry with this product   so very lovely stuff all around nice thick  chicken breast on this it's very nice very juicy   and the breading is just right along with  everything else on this with the pickles   very simple but like i usually have said  in the past many times simplicity is all   you really need with some of these things  but with the addition of fun marketing with   megan thee stallion i'm definitely digging  this one not bad the hottie sauce is here   so with that said i'm gonna have to give  technically the megan thee stallion hottie   sauce as part of the chicken sandwich over here  at popeye's a pretty decent   8 out of 10 guys it adds just enough heat just a little bit  to really make it feel something special but at   the same time it's very similar to the sweet heat  sauce that they have on top of the classic chicken   sandwich that you already know and love so minor  up charge aside i see what they're going for with   this one but at the same time it's really all  about this so you can obviously not only get   it on the chicken sandwich but like i mentioned  earlier on their tenders as well as the nuggets   but it's still pretty tasty and while it does  kind of remind me of sweet heat which it may   actually do the same for you as well i would  recommend giving this one a shot at least once   all right so the obvious question are you going  to be giving this one a shot i mean it's virtually   a no-brainer if you've made it this far into the  review right i mean you're excited about popeyes   in general for the chicken sandwich so any type  of collabo they have going with something quote   unquote new in terms of a new sauce of course  you're gonna give it a shot do me a quick   favor drop some comments down below let me know  what you thought of this after you give it a go   and really was it worth the marketing hype  did it remind you of sweet heat drop those   comments down below and definitely let me know  and with that this is Ian K closing out another   high quality foodie feature for you here on peep  this out reviews
