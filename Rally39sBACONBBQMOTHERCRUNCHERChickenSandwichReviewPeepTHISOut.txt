 hey everyone it's Ian K for peep this out reviews back at it once again this time over rally's to go in on one of the latest promos that's right so stay tuned because I'm about to see if it's one bad mother cruncher welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty so here we go with the bacon barbecue mother cruncher here at rally's and right off the bat let me just say that is a huge bakery style bun guys look at the size of this here especially compared to my hand it is pretty large nice and soft though let's take a look underneath looks like we've got some shredded iceberg lettuce and pickles there's some honey mustard that's attached to it there as well we've got some onion tanglers some bacon and it looks like that glaze that you're seeing there is the sweet and smoky barbecue sauce looking nice that's sitting all on top of a deep-fried chicken breast guys it's actually looking fairly decent in the size department let's see if I can lift this one up here and we can take a look at the bottom of it yeah that is pretty nice pretty big and definitely very very hot so looks like this is checking off the boxes and what a chicken sandwich should have more western-style than anything because of the onion tanglers the bacon and the barbecue sauce but with that honey mustard and pickles and the lettuce let's see how this all comes together this is the bacon barbecue mother cruncher here at rally's let's peep out this flavor well I definitely enjoy a good fried chicken sandwich every so often guys and as you obviously know there is a ton of choices out there some do it very well some don't do it very well but naturally when it comes to rally's chicken is not the first thing I think of but I gotta say this actually looks really really great the size of that chicken there is nice and sizable and I'm really impressed with the overall size of the bun that it's sitting on here so they're excited to get into this as always but like always before I do just

brand-new content drops every week guys the bacon barbecue mother cruncher sandwich here at rally's let's hit it mmm oh that's good right off the break this is almost like a panko flash-fry type of breading that its got guys and it really stands out and the juiciness of the chicken even for being white meat it's pretty amazing right now this is really really awesome it dovetails right into that sweet smoky barbecue glaze that it's got there and believe it or not the combination of the honey mustard I don't know about you guys when I get chicken tender just as a side note I like to kind of dip my sauces together the fact that you're actually getting two sauces completely different on top of each other with the sandwich is pretty good but the wild-card with this one is that flash-fry panko style crust that it's got on here so it's definitely crunchy it's definitely got some stuff to it and by stuff I mean flavor because it really is lighting it up beautifully let's go for another bite we'll give you some more close-ups but guys this is pretty awesome mmm yeah two bites in and I'm already thinking this is a serious contender in the chicken sandwich Wars right now guys the quality is pretty amazing look at the thickness of that white meat and that panko like breading that it's got around it it's not over the top but the flavor is amazing crunchiness is there the onion tanglers are pretty awesome the smokiness of the bacon and everything is coming together beautifully especially with that bakery style bun it's just really really solid and like I mentioned during that initial close-up it's got that western type of vibe because of the sweet smoky barbecue sauce in here and the fact that it's not over-the-top glazed with it I'm liking that because I can really taste that honey mustard beautifully as well I haven't even gotten to the pickles yet believe it or not there's just a lot going on with the sandwich and again the quality is pretty awesome let's keep going with it yeah I'm definitely enjoying this nothing against the other guys naturally every once in a while you want to see what the competition has to offer and I can actually say this is a competitive chicken sandwich and again guys the quality is pretty awesome on it here so just around this one out for you nice quality of the chicken as you can see it's fairly thick the panko breading that's got is really really solid as well and I'm saying its panko because it's got that vibe and you just have to try it to understand it it's really really almost granular but it really goes amazing with the chicken of course all the toppings the pickles I'm tasting now as well the acidity the slight snap the crunch the lettuce the bacon the onion Tanglers and everything on it I'm so glad this doesn't have tomato by default and I'm really glad it doesn't have cheese either because you can really get into the quality of all the other flavors everything is very distinct and this is an easy recommendation if you guys have a rally's or checkers in the area definitely give this one a go it is pretty awesome you know I definitely love to be pleasantly surprised every once in a while and when it comes to getting something like this at rally's right now let me just say my expectations weren't extremely high but I was very hopeful because the pictures look pretty awesome for this but after trying this now this is something that I would definitely get again because like I said the quality is coming through on that just not just because of the size of the chicken but all the toppings that working unison with it that one doesn't really overtake the other the quality is really really solid and like I said guys solid solid solid across the board I think I'm gonna keep saying it it's just a solid chicken sandwich so with that said I'm gonna have to give the bacon barbecue mother cruncher here at rally's definitely a pretty cool name by the way a very rock-solid 9 out of 10 the only thing keeping this one from the 10 out of 10 is maybe adding a little bit more bacon into the mix and honestly maybe just a little bit crispier in that regard because everything else is definitely primo easy recommendation and like I said if you've got a checkers or rally's in the area you definitely need to jump on over and give it a shot solid alright so let's just keep the theme going with this one here right now does this one look pretty solid to you do me a quick favor drop those comments down below have you tried this already over here at rally's have you tried the other classic version that they've got as well let me know if you've tried either them already and if you've had both which did you actually prefer out of the two drop those comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K closing out another episode of peep this out bringing you brand-new content every single week here on my channel so while you stay tuned for that
