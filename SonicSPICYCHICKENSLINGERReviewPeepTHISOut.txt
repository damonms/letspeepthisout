 hey everyone it's Ian K for peep this out reviews and I'm back on over at Sonic to take a look at one of their all-new chicken slingers so stay tuned because the spicy variant is up next welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty so here we go with the spicy chicken slinger here at Sonic and initial first impressions on this one very very small now I keep in mind I know they're supposed to be tiny snack sized sandwiches but guys look at this compared to my hand right now for $2.50 that is extremely small but then again the presentation it's pretty cool-looking on it here so let's pop the top of the brioche bun take a look underneath it looks like we've got some of their spicy ranch sauce two slices of pickle kind of thick cut very nice underneath that and all white meat chicken patty crispy goodness right there not too bad underneath it is gonna be nothing so average size here in terms of the chicken I just overall a very very small presentation and like I said for $2.50 this really doesn't look like it should be much above a buck 50 if you ask me at the most maybe 2 for $2.50 but it is what it is let's just see if the flavors gonna deliver on this one and again presentation is not too bad I definitely like the way it looks right there this is the spicy chicken slinger here at Sonic let's peep out this flavor yeah man I really hope this is gonna deliver flavor wise because I got to be honest I'm feeling just a little ripped off two dollars and fifty cents for something very very tiny and again I know it's a snack sized sandwich but guys that is very very tiny and some of my chicken doesn't even have coating on it right there on one of the sides as I'm holding this the bottom of the bun is kind of cracking as well so this is already not starting off right but it looks decent that's the only thing so before I get started on this one and like always if you guys are fans of high quality delicious looking food reviews make sure to hit that

this is good here we go well that spicy ranch is good and the pickle is pretty good as well but the bun on the bottom like I feared is very hard you guys can actually see it right there it's kind of falling apart believe it or not it's really kind of crusted over it feels like too it's got not a nice soft texture at all but the top is soft so the brioche is decent juiciness of the chicken is so-so I'm getting more of that coming from the pickle I think that's kind of dovetailing into it but the overall flavor is just okay so decent for what this is like I said guys but the price is very very high and I just wish it was just a little softer overall look at the bottom of that bun right there I don't really know what's going on right now let's go for another bite hopefully we can pull out a little bit better of a score on this one because right now I'm not really digging it overall just with everything let's keep going mmm man the chicken as I'm going into it it's very chewy yeah this is not quality this is not quality to me right now at all guys and again take a look very very tiny piece of chicken again I know it's a snack sized sandwich and I hate to beat it to death here but I am really not feeling the fact that the bun overall is only soft a little bit on top hard on the bottom and the chewiness of that that chicken is really not doing me any favors right now but the saving grace of this is the spicy ranch and I love ranch in general it's got a nice little bit of sizzle to it but nothing crazy just to kind of let you know in your palate you've got something kind of heated there but the ranch is creamy it's decent and it goes well with the pickles I just wish everything that it was trying to light up with here was a little bit more flavorful so I'm gonna go for one more bite with this one there's really nothing else to say about it we'll give you another close-up but guys like I said I'm definitely not a fan of the price point with this I really think it's overpriced for what it is and I know what they're trying to go for in terms of making this similar to another type of chicken sandwich that's out by the other guys right now but seriously this needs to be just a little bit better overall at least with the price point that's the main thing on top of the overall freshness and just the quality of what I'm getting here today just so-so so one more bite we'll finish it up after the rating and then we'll close this one out well as you can tell based upon my feelings with this one throughout the review I really can't recommend this one at least the version that I got today guys like I said the hardness of that bun is really killing this one on top of the overall quality of the chicken and just in general the price point so for what you see here for what you get I see what they're trying to emulate but overall outside of the curiosity factor I probably wouldn't recommend getting this one again at least not for me anyway definitely not this is how we sonic you know had I gotten a better piece of chicken on my version of this today this probably would have gone a lot better overall but guys as it stands that chicken just was not working for me whatsoever it felt like I really had to bite into it and once I did it felt like I was getting through some layers that I didn't think I needed to get through it didn't feel like a natural piece of chicken that way wasn't super juicy and definitely there was no real coating on that one outside of the real edges that you saw for the ones that did have the coating so lackluster in that regard and of course the bun being what it is not super fresh this definitely feels like it was a little bit older it is what it is add the fact that you've got two dollars and fifty cents on top of it that they say only $2.49 definitely overpriced already out the gate guys so what else can i really say well in truth absolutely nothing because obviously you know how I feel about this one so with that said I'm gonna have to give the spicy chicken slinger here at Sonic a very mediocre 3.5 out of 10 this was definitely a lackluster experience today would I get that again definitely not am i curious to try the other one with mayo absolutely not because I'm not a super fan of mayo and that's a main ingredient of that one the only saving grace with this I'm really gonna base that score on the spicy ranch which was good along with the pickles everything else no bueno all right now the question is are you personally gonna be giving this one a shot over here at Sonic are you curious to try these chicken slingers I mean after all they're only $2.49 does this look like a value to you drop some comments down below and definitely let me know and do you think this is actually better than some of the other chicken sandwiches out there if you've given this a try all already drop those comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K closing out another episode

to go head-to-head in these chicken sandwich wars you need to beef this one at big time it's got some pretty nice qualities overall with that sauce and the pickles but everything else needs an
