 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty with all the love that BK shows their King line of burgers month after month I guess I can understand why their signature flagship burger might be a little heated and it looks like that anger is signaled the return of a fan favorite the angry whopper back on the menu here at BK guys looking just as glorious as I remember from a couple of years ago when the angriest whopper came out with that red bun lots going on in the middle here guys let's pop the top of the sesame seed bun and take a look looks like plenty of lettuce looks like we've got a decent amount of mayo as well two slices of tomato we have some angry onions essentially the fried onion situation there see if I can go a little bit deeper in we've got some angry sauce it looks like sliced jalapenos there is just a lot going on here guys hickory smoked bacon all in effect they're a slice of American cheese and of course a quarter pound of 100% flame grilled beef looking very very nice guys lots going on like I said and a very very messy burger prepare to hold this one with two hands you're definitely gonna need it and before we pull back again let me see if I can go just a little deeper and it looks like I want to say about five or so jalapeno slices and the angry sauce that's mixed throughout there as well but man looking really really nice and it smells really really great guys as you can see this burger is absolutely stacked we're getting into this guy's it's the angry whopper returning in 2019 for BK let's peep out this flavor it's angry it's big and it still looks intimidating even with a single patty of beef let's dive in it's the angry whopper back on the menu for 2019 and I wasn't kidding when I said this was a two-hander guys look at this thing here we go instant sweetness from that angry sauce with just a little bit of sizzle coming up on the back end right now I haven't gotten any jalapenos just yet so there's really no extra heat that I'm getting here and the angry onions are really coming through nicely 'cuz they're nice and crispy nice and fried but so far after this first bite this is really feeling like a super whopper with a little bit of extra flavor to it let's keep going mmm now I'm getting some heat coming from those jalapenos nicely guys on the sweetness on the back end because of the angry sauce beautiful situation and that's honestly what this one needed right away and I'm glad there's plenty of jalapenos on here to really satisfy it because you need those jalapenos to really give you that effect for some reason the angry sauce is a lot sweeter than I remember it from the angriest whopper a couple of years ago but I love the flavor that it's bringing to the table with this one and when you combine it with the heat from the jalapenos and the crispiness of the onions and of course all the other regular ingredients of the whopper it's a pretty nice situation on top of the hickory smoked bacon guys just very delicious and I can see why people love this one but the sweetness is just a little up there for me just a little bit yeah it's a pretty stacked burger with a lot going on here and I really love the fact that the angry onions are back because I have to admit the fried goodness along with that angry sauce goes amazingly well with this again it's very very sweet but then you're getting the nice fried crispiness of the onions themselves and it's delicious just for that alone yeah and being that I'm a fan of jalapenos I'm very glad that there is plenty on here right now now granted your mileage may vary sometimes you may get some slices that are small some may be a little bit bigger but generally on the version that I'm having right now these are actually pretty tasty and they do deliver the heat nicely along with that sauce guys just overall a very nice situation and unfortunately the American cheese is really kind of the only detriment to this one because it's really holding everything together that's about it really can't taste anything because of the sweetness of the sauce and that heat coming up on the back end from it along with the jalapenos but guys it's delicious either way well this sure is a messy burger as you can tell it's got a lot going on here so have plenty of napkins on hand and while I do love the overall flavor of this one it is a very tasty thing I actually like the angriest whopper a little bit better only because of that red bun really playing with my head just a little bit I mean that one just looked visually awesome and while the sweetness on that one wasn't nearly as high as I'm experiencing with this version right now this one is still a very very tasty burger guys and it's got a lot that you're gonna enjoy on it especially if you like heat I'm sure all you fans of the angry whopper are gonna be dancing in the streets with this one now that it's back on the menu for a limited time only here at BK and I have to admit although this is my first time having the original version without the red bun I actually thought it was pretty tasty and I can see why a lot of people do love it but for me personally like I said the sauce is just a little too sweet and thankfully it's muted just a little bit because of the light sizzle it has on its own combined with those jalapenos that combination is a very beautiful situation but I can't help but feel that the angry sauce should have been just a little bit hotter on its own but maybe they'll save that for the return of the angriest whopper eventually right BK alright so overall rating wise on this one I'm gonna have to give the angry whopper returning here to BK just a decent 7.8 out of 10 if this one was just a little hotter and maybe just a little less sweeter it easily would have been into the 8 8.5 category but as it stands it's still a very delicious burger it does have some decent heat to it it's just not as angry as I wanted it to be but very delicious either way only at Burger King but of course that begs the question did this look delicious to you drop some comments down below are you a fan of the angry whopper already and if you are how excited are you to give this new version of it a shot here in 2019 drop those comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K closing out another episode of peep this out bringing you brand new content every single week here on my channel so while you stay tuned for the next review coming real soon in the meantime stay frosty what is that I could have sworn I heard the angry whopper say you wouldn't like me when I'm angry that's actually not true I like the angry whopper I would actually love to see it in the red bun and possibly even a green one guys how cool would this be for like a Hulk burger right it fits alright everyone until next time I'll talk to you soon
