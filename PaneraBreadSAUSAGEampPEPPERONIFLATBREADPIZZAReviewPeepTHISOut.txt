 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty hey everyone welcome back to another high  quality foodie feature for you here on the   channel where this time i'm back on over at  panera bread to check out the latest edition   they've just added to their tasty flatbread  pizza menu and tasty it sure does look guys   feast your eyes on the sausage and pepperoni  flatbread pizza definitely a lovely situation   of meaty goodness on top of some flatbread guys i  gotta say this is looking pretty awesome already   so starting off with the obvious we've got a  lot of meaty goodness and it includes chicken   sausage crumbles thick sliced pepperoni along with  a blend of shredded fontina and mozzarella cheese   and guys that's in addition to the tomato bell  pepper sauce and if you look closely you may see   little bits of pepper all throughout this here and  that's all on some toasted flatbread that appears   to be cut into six pieces but again guys very nice  meatiness going on with this one in particular and   i gotta say with sausage being one of my all-time  favorite toppings i can't wait to get into this   so let's do just that this is the all-new sausage  and pepperoni flatbread pizza here at panera bread   let's peep out this flavor yes sir lots of meaty  goodness on this one and for all you pepperoni   heads out there you have something to look forward  to because there's a decent amount of pepperoni in   addition to those chicken sausage crumbles i'm  really impressed with the presentation of this   one here all right let me pull up a piece of this  and we'll definitely get it going this is looking   really really nice we'll go for this middle chunk  right over there take a look at that action and   again let me try and keep that focus you've  got some bell pepper goodness there with that   sauce you can kind of see the green right  there at the end but guys plenty of meaty   goodness with this one this is looking really  really great all right enough talking let's get   into it it's the only sausage and pepperoni  flatbread pizza here at panera let's do it right away saltiness the spicing of the sausage  mmm yeah well i know this is chicken but you'd   be hard-pressed to tell me this wasn't regular  sausage because it really does taste like that   and obviously the spicing has a lot to do  with it it really tastes very authentic to   me so a leaner protein for sure especially  because it's chicken but when you add a   little bit of the heat of the pepperoni  and the flavor of the pepperonis to   along with the fontina the mozzarella all  that good stuff that is a very tasty first   bite and again guys on some toasty flatbread  not too bad in the toastiness department i   wish it was just a little bit more seems to  be the case with these but even still very   delicious overall with the quality let's  keep going in guys this is pretty tasty oh yeah yeah this is definitely not your typical  pizza sauce for sure naturally with this being   more of like an artisan style pizza because it's  flat bread in the way that they're advertising   this here you'd expect it to be a little bit  different in the sauce department and it is   you can definitely taste little bits of bell  pepper with this it really is visible too this   time out which is nice but again i wish this was  just a little bit more toastier on the bottom but   even still very nice with the quality of  the sausage and the pepperoni the overall   combination obviously is gonna work because that  combination works in general for pizza pretty good   and real quick speaking about the toppings  that do work well for pizza and naturally   as i mentioned earlier you're going to see a few  reviews popping up on your screen right now some   of the other flatbreads that i've done over here  panera definitely check those out i'm so glad to   officially add this one to the playlist because  now we have a sausage variant and most of you guys   know i'm absolutely a fan of sausage in general so  this is definitely a highlight i was very excited   to give this to go but the fact that it's chicken  is not really deterring me too much guys because   like i said it comes down to the spicing if this  was beyond meat it probably tastes the same but   the spicing is so unique to sausage you know  you're eating it when you have it so naturally   having this being a leaner type of protein i'm  down with it it's not bad just keep going in yeah definitely tasty with all those toppings  and of course the cheese and the sauce but   after i took that last bite guys now i'm really  wishing this was in the oven maybe another minute   or two more because i kind of bit into what i  feel is a little bit of a raw piece of dough   i got to be honest guys i wish it was just a  little bit different but take a look at that as   it tries to focus in hopefully we can get that  to go there let's start with that there you go   it needs just a little bit more as you can see  it needs to be toastier that's the only thing   the edges are good but the middle of it just a  little bit more is needed here but even still the   quality is good on all the other toppings it's  an artisan style situation naturally and i'm   really digging the overall combination obviously  of the sausage chicken along with the pepperoni   and the cheese it's still pretty tasty just for  that all right so let's go for one more bite of   this one before we wrap it up after the rating  coming up next but guys again i'm so glad to have   given this one a shot and naturally having choice  on the menu when it comes to flatbread pizza here   at panera is always a plus so hopefully they're  going to keep adding to it but like i said the   combination is classic here you've got sausage and  pepperoni how much more classic can you get other   than just sausage by itself or pepperoni  by itself one more bite we'll close it up all right so let me give you a shot of one of  these corner pieces here and as you can see   nice toasty ends when it comes to the flatbread  itself here it's just a little raw in the middle   in my opinion here but even still it's just barely  passable the mouthfeel is decent but it needs to   be crispier but even still with this combination  of toppings like i said it really works very   well guys i mean you've got sausage you've got  pepperoni and an okay amount of cheese on this   one the flavor is good and i gotta say that bell  pepper sauce the tomato goodness it combines well   with everything here pretty nice so with that said  i'm gonna have to give the sausage and pepperoni   flatbread pizza here at panera bread a pretty  decent 8.2 out of 10 this one could have   easily scored a few more points had it been just  a little bit toastier on the bottom but even still   the quality of those ingredients are very solid  overall and i got to admit for the price point   being what it is i mean $10.89 it's a little pricey still  but you are getting some nice quality and the   overall size is pretty decent on it toasty issues  with the flatbread itself not withstanding i got   to say guys it was still pretty decent i mean it's  not quite a thin crust it's not quite traditional   pizza either but at the same time it's right there  in the middle and it gives you just enough mouth   feel to feel like you're biting into a decent  piece of pizza but at the same time it needed   to just be a little bit crispier on the bottom  that really would have made it just ultra primo   all right enough of that i'm sure you get  the point by now do me a quick favor drop   some comments down below are you a fan of the  flatbread pizzas over here at panera do you   think they're worth the money i mean 10 or 11  dollars here on the west coast is a little pricey   overall do you think that's actually worth  it to you i mean based upon the quality of   the ingredients drop those comments down below and  definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K   closing out another high quality foodie feature  for you here on peep this out reviews bringing   you brand new content every single week here  on my channel so while you stay tuned for that next   review coming real soon in the meantime stay  frosty all right panera now i mentioned this   early in my review and naturally with the  spicing of this particular sausage when it   comes to the chicken like i said it's got the  mouth feel of sausage it tastes like sausage   i think what you've got to do now is a beyond  meat variant for real legit let's see some   beyond meat or something like that on one of these  flatbread pizzas i think that'll be pretty good   all right guys until next time i'll talk to you  soon hey thanks for checking out another one of   my reviews but just in case you didn't see the one  before this one you can find it right up over here   along what i think youtube's gonna recommend  for you to check out as well as always i think   you'll find something like in both of them and  i'll definitely catch you in the next one see ya
