lovely situation of cheesy goodness  let's break this one on down real fast yes sir   definitely an awesome presentation on all these  goodies i have in front of me here right now guys   starting off with the main star of the show the  cheesy alfredo action that we've got with our   oven baked pastas here at pizza hut what this  is is a nice portion of penne pasta topped off   with a newly revamped creamy alfredo sauce and two  layers of cheese before it's dusted with parmesan   on the very top to finish it off and guys a very  plentiful amount of that goodness as well you can   see that oven baked goodness through and through  and it's looking pretty fantastic off to the side   i've got five buttery breadsticks to go in on  as well guys so a very nice value at $8.99 and   i got to say again the presentation is killer  on top of the aroma which is lighting up my car   very nicely right now and you know being that  i love cheese this was definitely gonna be the   next one i was gonna check out guys because  i had so much fun checking out the previous   variant that i did the very first one the italian  meats which you're probably seeing jumping up on   your screen here right now definitely take  a look at that one because spoiler alert   it was pretty tasty but do not watch it hungry  that's all i have to say there's a lot of good   footage in that one but with this i think we're  gonna get some equally awesome footage you guys   as you can see a lovely situation of goodness  here alfredo creaminess a newly revamped recipe   and there is two layers of cheese and this  is already looking awesome lots of alfredo   sauce here let me just show you this real  quick there is lots of cheesy goodness   as you can see it's coated nicely i love the fact  that they've migrated over to penne pasta instead   of the squiggly types of pastas that they had  before this is so much better let's give this   a shot here we go it's the oven baked cheesy  alfredo pasta here pizza hut let's peep this out mmm oh just the right amount of saltiness from that  cheese the creaminess of the alfredo and the   al dente penny pasta on this guys that is really  really awesome really nice in terms of the flavor   and a noticeable step up compared to the  previous tuscani goodness which i actually   reviewed a couple of chances are you're probably  seeing those on your screen here right now as well   take a look at that playlist and you'll  find those goodies there this is a   very nice upgrade the creaminess is on point  very thick very hearty let's keep going in wow so amazing i love the fact that the accent  of the parmesan on the top is standing out as   well it's really all throughout this but guys  the creaminess is crazy with this two layers of   pizza cheese i'm thinking here but man that is  a lovely situation of luscious pasta goodness   really done the pizza hut way the new version  of this is really nice just look at that   gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous let's keep going in   man this is heavenly right now it really is and because these are staring at me right now  let's pull up one of the five breadsticks again   a crazy value guys i mean these alone are about  four or five bucks for uh just a regular order   but you get this along with the pasta which  is crazy and as you can see plenty of that   parmesan buttery goodness dusted on the very top  there let's give this a shot real quick again you know what let me do just a little of the  alfredo sauce with it just a little right there good either way yeah i do love that butteriness  that this has got as well too guys   very very nice but of course we are here for the  main star of the shows let's go for another few   on this guys a very lovely situation with the  cheesy goodness i am totally digging this here   they've got a chicken alfredo version  of this as well as a veggie version so   we'll probably have to round out the uh portfolio  of pizza hut reviews eventually with those two   chances are you're probably gonna see them but i  gotta say guys this is a nice little introduction   to the alfredo goodness to go with this guys it  really works very nicely and again the value is   kicking with this one that's pretty much banging  actually with the breadsticks and the flavor is   pretty awesome i love the new recipe that they've  got compared to the old one this is pretty good man i love all the cheesy goodness on this  too the layer is thick on the top guys i mean   this is just minutes old but it is very dense  so let me just pull a couple more from this here   giving you as many money shots as i  can straight through with this because   it is totally worth it when  they say this is cheesy alfredo   they mean this is cheesy alfredo this is  definitely going the extra mile to satisfy very   creamy very indulgent with just the right amount  of saltiness like i said with the cheese and it   goes amazing with the al dente-ness of the penne  pasta pretty nice let's go for another couple man i can almost kill this whole thing  right now if i really wanted to this is so   good all right i got to keep it together to finish  this review so let's go for one more with this one   i'm gonna pick up just a little  bit more of the cheesy action   and uh we'll pull this up here let me just try  and get this set up for you one more bite we'll   finish the review out with the rating coming up  next but guys a beautiful situation of goodness   very creamy very hearty and easily worth your  time to try especially if you haven't had pasta   over here at pizza hut in a while this is  a very very nice upgraded revamped version   of what they've had before very very tasty  one more bite and we'll close it out hang on so are you tired of looking at this one yet i  am definitely not guys you gotta love that two   layers of cheese goodness on the very top of  this one that is really what sets this one off   here presentation wise and of course with the  dusting of the parmesan the creaminess of that   alfredo goodness underneath it and of course the  al dente of the pasta itself the penne is awesome   you know what you need to do guys give this  one a shot pretty tasty stuff guys pretty tasty   hashtag unsponsored okay overall i'm gonna  have to give the oven baked cheesy alfredo   pasta here at pizza hut a rock solid 9 out  of 10 guys these are really off the chart in   terms of the value the flavor is very high and  i gotta say the presentation also rocks on top   of everything else here the creaminess i gotta  say of the upgraded alfredo recipe is noticeably   different it's creamier it's a little bit richer  to me and definitely it has the right amount of   saltiness on top of that with the two layers of  cheese especially and again the upgrade over into   penne pasta is a beautiful situation because  some of that sauce gets on the inside of each   of them and i gotta say there's plenty of it to go  around but guys i keep coming back to it $8.99 over   here in southern cali with five breadsticks that's  a crazy value and i have to say again solid solid   solid across the board something worth checking  out i would recommend it for you it's pretty tasty   all right so by the time this video airs chances  are you're going to have access to these oven   baked pastas pretty much all
