 what's going on everyone and welcome back  to another high quality foodie feature for   you here on the channel where this time i've  returned to domino's to complete the trifecta   that is their all new oven baked dips that's  right and as you already know it's dessert   time so stay tuned because the baked apple  dip with cinnamon bread twists is up next   welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty all right here we go it's the baked apple dip  and cinnamon bread twist here at domino's and   i got to tell you guys the aroma in my car  right now is screaming the fall season there   is plenty of cinnamon plenty of apple here and  i haven't even lift the lid yet of the tin that   we're about to get into here but man i gotta  say this is looking and smelling great already   so starting off with the eight piece order of  cinnamon bread twists this is looking pretty   glorious right now guys a pretty decent amount  of cinnamon drizzle is all over this and you can   really smell the sweetness in the air the  cinnamon is very strong and i gotta say it   complements the puffiness of these twists very  nicely fresh baked and this is just minutes old   so it's absolutely burning hot right now and i  gotta say it looks and smells really really great   but as tasty as these look what we really want  to see is what they're gonna be paired with guys   feast your eyes on the baked apple dip itself and  again a very strong aroma of cinnamon and apples   this is looking pretty awesome guys what this  basically is is sweet and gooey oven baked apples   with plenty of cinnamon flavor and it looks very  gooey for sure and very sweet a very decent amount   and it's filling out the bottom of this tin very  nicely i'm definitely digging the presentation   it's pretty striking visually alright so let's get  these two together immediately this is the all-new   baked apple dip and cinnamon bread twists here  at domino's let's peep out this flavor yes sir   talk about a lusciously sweet looking situation  we've got in front of us here right now guys these   apples definitely look sweet and gooey and i have  to say the cinnamon is striking on this one in the   aroma department on top of the aroma of the apples  themselves this really feels like the fall season   is all in my car here right now everything  is wafting around it really smells amazing   and honestly given the flavors i'm about to get  into right now you'd expect it to kind of smell   like that guys i mean it's apple and cinnamon  it goes perfect for dessert and considering the   two dips that i just reviewed here on the channel  which you guys are now seeing on the screen here   starting off with that five cheese dip i gotta  say that was an amazing situation in general   and following that with the cheesy marinara  guys a very lovely situation indeed across   the board with those two but naturally going for  dessert at the very end of course that was gonna be   in the cards right so let me get started real  quick here we're gonna pull one of these up   let me just switch hands real quick okay there we  go take a look at this guys that cinnamon drizzle   is pretty nice this one's a little light in  that there but the flavor i have it feeling   is going to be pretty amazing on it there take a  look at the puffiness of this dough here looking   really really nice and again the aroma is very  very strong so one quick bite and then we'll   get into the dip naturally to combo it out and  then we'll see how this is hang on one second i love these things i don't care what's on them  they're puffy they're airy but they're dense at   the same time really nice and just to give you  the visual on the inside take a look at that guys   fresh baked and it is definitely on point honestly  this is really the right amount of cinnamon sugar   if you ask me this is really not overpowering  it's strong but just strong enough to not drown   out the flavor of the actual dough itself so this  almost feels like i'm having like a cinnamon donut   which is pretty amazing but pairing it up with  this take a look at that guys we're gonna try and   keep that focused as much as possible and i'm just  gonna go in try and get as much as it's very gooey   i don't think this is gonna work very  well but i'm gonna try okay there we go   some of the ooey gooey action here right now let's  give it a shot the baked apple dip here we go that's insane wow actually it's crazy insane  in terms of the flavor guys i have to say the   gooeyness that i'm getting with this right now  it almost kind of feels like there's like an   apple puree kind of mixed with it but the  cinnamon is just as strong with the apples   so it's very sweet but at the same time the  baked flavor is pretty insane and honestly   i think it's going to be easier using the end  pieces instead of that larger piece on the   actual bread twist themselves to kind of scoop  it because as you can see and you probably saw   with that first one it's very thick so i'm going  to try and scoop a little bit more but i'm getting   a lot of the gooeyness action right there it  really is pretty tasty let's keep going in   oh man this is crazy good it's like apple  pie that i'm having right now so strong   vibrant and the doughy softness that i'm getting  is so tasty with it it's really good let me get   you right up on this so you can see what  i'm dealing with here guys it's so thick   it is not even dripping down on the tin even  though this is very very warm right now it   just shows how ooey and gooey this is it's  all staying clumped together but it's really   heavenly in terms of the flavor if you like apple  which i mentioned i guess you do because you're   watching this right now you're definitely  going to dig this one here it is really nice   and of course it pairs beautifully with these  cinnamon twists guys and again a very lovely   situation in terms of the flavor these things  are just super fun to eat and i really like how   they kind of vary in size slightly they're mostly  oversized this time out which i'm really digging   and i'm really digging the puffiness there as you  can see let me see if i can try and give this a   go again it's a little difficult but i'm going  to give it a shot hopefully you guys are seeing   as much as i can show you here with this  here we go there's the madness there's the   madness right there let's give this a shot  i'm digging this guys it is really delicious come on now you already know  this is insane in-freaking sane   and don't think for a second that little piece  that just dropped off right now is going to get   away from me i'm definitely giving him  a shot right now with a little bit of   apple goodness and again that puree is lovely  guys it is really tasty let's keep going in   man oh man i may actually kill  this here in the car this is crazy   all right i think you get the point by now with  this one here let me go for one more quick scoop   of this i'll give you the close-up and then we'll  wrap this one up with the rating coming up next   but man guys a lovely situation of ooey gooey  apple goodness with plenty of cinnamon and this is   just an amazing situation it really feels like an  apple pie in your hand or a really decadent donut   with plenty of cinnamon and plenty of apple puree  just everything with this is amazing guys and the   chunks are really nice this is just easily worth  your time and a nice capper to any meal that you   get over here at domino's or if it's just going  to be the meal by itself i'm not going to judge   this is just really really great well this one's  going to be pretty easy for me right now guys with   everything you've seen and heard up to this point  i'm gonna have to give the all-new baked apple dip   and cinnamon bread twist here at domino's a rock  solid 10 out of 10 guys there is nothing wrong   with this whatsoever it really is the perfect  amount of that type of dip for the actual   breadsticks that i have and i have to say the  cinnamon on all those is just perfect for me right   now it's not really over the top it's just enough  but it's so flavorful and vibrant when you compare   that with the ooey gooey goodness of that apple  situation guys again that dip is amazing right   now the sweetness is on point even though it's a  little bit elevated but the cinnamon the overall   feeling of everything again it really feels like  i'm having apple pie in my car right now i mean   if i had some ice cream it would literally  be apple pie a la mode that's just a lovely   situation indeed and again you're getting a very  decent amount of that goodness that really covers   the bottom of the tin beautifully and the portion  size is pretty perfect for the amount of bread   twists that you get here nice combination and again  the fall season definitely has something to look   forward to as we continue through it with that one  really really good stuff all right so very simply   out of the three reviews that i've done over here  at domino's now featuring these all new oven baked   dips which is your personal favorite out of
