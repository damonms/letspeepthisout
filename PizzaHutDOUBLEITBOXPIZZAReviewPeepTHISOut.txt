 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty it's another high quality foodie feature for you with Ian K here on peep this out reviews this time over a pizza hut to go in on what looks like a pretty solid value guys for $12.99 feast your eyes on the double it box featuring two medium pan style pizzas with one topping and i gotta say this is looking pretty awesome and as you can see i decided to go with sausage on one and pepperoni on the other looking nice and crispy and definitely very very solid in this oversized box definitely can't wait to get into this so let's do just that it's the double it box brand new here at pizza hut let's peep this out yeah this is a pretty tasty looking deal for $12.99 but truth be told the main reason i wanted to try this was the fact that they're square shaped compared to what i'm usually used to from pizza hut mostly like you guys i'm sure it's pretty much the round style like we all are this is more like little caesar's traditional almost sicilian sliced and i really wanted to try it just for that reason but again you can't beat the presentation of this one guys it is looking really really nice i can barely lift this up in my car let me put this one down here and we'll give this a go but real quick and like always if you guys are fans of high quality delicious looking food reviews make sure to hit that subscribe button down below and don't forget to tap that bell icon so you can be notified as soon as brand new content drops every week all right i'm gonna save the sausage for last because that's one of my favorites here but let me pull one of these pieces up just to show you nice and crispy take a look at that those really look beautiful guys the crispiness of that pepperoni is on point and this is pan style so it's nice and thick right there i decided to go with the garlic buttery blend for the crust but this is looking really really good let's give this a go it's the pepperoni pizza in square shaped form here at pizza it's tasty you know i don't know if it's the shape of this one but for some reason there is a lot more buttery taste than that compared to what i'm used to from pizza hut and take a look at the bottom of this guys that is really very toasted there it's kind of focusing trying to focus in but as you can see very buttery i'm definitely digging the crust on this one here i haven't gotten to the very back but i'm digging the underneath part of it here it is definitely crispy nice and toasted as you can see and the toastiness of those pepperonis is on point let's go for more bite of this one yeah that is really good all right this is going to be kind of a quick video but before we get into that next slice let's go for a bite of that garlic buttery blend in the very back here i have never actually had it or at least i don't remember i've had it over here let's give it a shot garlicky buttery blended this is really really good wow that's really good feast your eyes again on that i'm definitely digging the quality of this one look at that the pepperoni action in that decent amount of cheese but man that garlic butteriness there my fingers are greasy lit up with butter and greased together this is really really tasty one more bite we're gonna get into that sausage slice just to round it out pretty good yeah that's pretty solid most of you guys know pepperoni is not really my go-to it's the sausage that is but i do have to say the pepperoni is made pretty well over here it's nice and crispy there's a decent amount of them on the top of this pizza but naturally that buttery garlicky goodness on the very back and the crust is a highlight right there so a beautiful situation and you do get eight pieces like a traditional medium anyway so pretty solid for that all right let me pull up one of these sausage slices here because why not we'll go for this nice big one right over here feast your eyes on that goodness that is looking pretty nice now these are the pellet formed sausages it looks like here they're not exactly like you know the pulled style that i'm kind of used to it more of a traditional mom and pop so it kind of is what it is for fast food pizza but again the nice toastiness on the bottom of this one and of course that garlic buttery blend on the very back let's give this a shot for a couple of bites over here it's part of the double it up box it's tasty come on you know what it is maybe it's because i took the middle piece on this one but this one's a little bit more airier on the inside but the crispiness is on point and again all that beautiful goodness from pizza hut as you can see here that sausage flavor is coming through pretty nicely the spicing is very nice on this here and naturally with that buttery goodness on the very bottom a lovely situation so let's go for a quick bite of that crust in the back here real quick and then we'll just finish it out that is good but let's add a sausage oh yeah this is gonna get demolished today i already know very good so yeah lovely situation 13 bucks you get two full-size medium pizzas here in square form i think that really makes the difference because not only is it easier to put in the box it's a different form factor it feels new because of that just having pizza in this form not normally from pizza hut anyway because like i said i'm more used to the round style as most of you guys are this is actually really really good and i'm really surprised that they don't do a deep dish style like little caesars like this because they do have the pan style action here and the height is almost the same they really should have a product line that actually offers something similar but i do like this it is worth your time for 13 bucks 8 pieces per pizza and you really can't hate on it and like i said for 13 bucks definitely solid guys definitely solid the double it box only from pizza hut so with that said i'm gonna have to give the double it box here at pizza hut a pretty rock solid 8.5 out of 10 now the only reason i'm not gonna go any higher than that is because guys let's be honest it's pizza hut pizza the only thing different about this is just the shape that it's in but granted the value is high the flavor is pretty decent and the garlic buttery blend was a beautiful situation on the back of that that's the main reason i'm pretty much gonna finish this pizza because i love the flavor of that i pretty much should have gotten that from the beginning but hey more often than not i'm pretty much reviewing a lot of the promo pizzas here at pizza hut so i have to get them as is but being that you do have your choice on crust on this one as well as toppings why not try something new right and i'm glad i got that flavored crust because it was pretty awesome all right now the obvious question at least to me anyway is did this deal look pretty awesome to you drop some comments down below first and foremost is pizza hut your favorite fast food type of pizza and if it is are you gonna be giving this one a shot for $12.99 drop those comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian closing out another high quality
