 hey everyone welcome back to another high quality  foodie feature for you here on the channel   cheaters cam style after hours over  at little caesars to go in on what   looks to be something a little extra for  their extra most bestest pepperoni pizza   that's right so here we go with the pepperoni and  cheese stuffed crust pizza and as always a very   lovely situation coming right out of the pizza  portal guys this is ultra fresh right now so   what we've got here is a large fan favorite  extramostbestest pepperoni pizza topped off with 50   slices of pepperoni or nine feet of it actually  and of course it's mixed with all the goodness in   the cheese department mozzarella and muenster all  over the place but guys the big draw with this one   is there's three feet of cheese stuffed into the  crust and i gotta say guys along with that you're   getting some pepperoni action on the inside of the  crust as well a very lovely situation and it looks   fantastic and speaking of the crust we've actually  got some parmesan and butter flavor baked right   into it as well so guys a nice combination of  goodness here all around and plenty of pepperoni   and of course cheese to go around and guys come  on it's stuffed crust how could you not want to   get into this right well i'm definitely not going  to wait to do that it's the pepperoni and cheese   stuffed crust pizza here at little caesars let's  peep out this flavor you know i got to admit and most   of you guys may know this already but pepperoni  is not my all-time go-to when it comes to pizza   toppings but i have to admit this looks pretty  fantastic and guys when it has so much cheese on   the inside of the crust i was sold right there  who doesn't love stuffed crust right all right   as difficult as pizza is to review in the car i'm  gonna give it that old college try here right now   let me pick up a piece of this real fast wow the  grease is real on this one take a look at that   guys nice and greasy the pepperoni action with  over 50 slices you expect this pizza to be a   little wet right but take a look at that on the  inside you can almost kind of see through that   there plenty of cheese and nice little rings of  pepperoni action guys let's give this a shot right   now it's the pepperoni and cheese stuffed crust  pizza from little caesars let's peep this out oh yeah come on all day long all right so  obviously i didn't want to wait on this one   of course you got to take a bite in the very  front just to kind of get the mood set you   know i mean this looks fantastic already but you  really want to dovetail right into the taste of   the pizza itself before you get into that crusty  cheese action on the very back over here but guys   i'm digging the pepperonis take a look at this  here as you guys can see nice caramelized edges   on those pepperonis and if you look carefully it  looks like it's hit with an extra dose of italian   seasoning this feels distinctly different from  the last versions that i've tried over here and   honestly i'm digging the presentation but again  the grease is real look at the very bottom of   this here right now it is absolutely soaked and  i got to be very careful with this one here my   fingers are completely lit up with the greasy  goodness but again pretty fantastic here one   more bite in the front and we're definitely  going to get into this crust guys hang on oh yeah banging let me give you another quick shot  of the crust on this one here and as you can see   another oily situation indeed but if you're  noticing in the very back it seems like it's   toasted just a little bit more maybe because it's  a little bit heavier in the back maybe the way   it's sitting in the pan the way it's baked there  but i'm really digging the presentation there and   as you guys can see plenty of the cheesy goodness  in effect guys three feet of cheese going around   this one here and i gotta say i'm pretty impressed  with the overall appearance of this one here looks   really good so a little bit of the parmesan action  in the very back and naturally with the butter   wash we're gonna get into that as well but a very  lovely situation with the extramostbestest here   just a banging situation already and for those  of you who are familiar with the little caesar's   playlist here on the channel you're probably  going to remember that i reviewed the stuffed   crest version of the extra most bestest back in  the day so this is pretty much the same pizza but   they're putting pepperoni into the actual crust  itself here and guys if you want to go way back   in the day they actually had a stuffed crust deep  deep dish version of this that was one of my early   reviews which was exactly what this is pepperoni  and cheese in the thicker deep dish version so   this is pretty much the evolution of that but on  a smaller scale but a bigger scale smaller because   it's a thin crust pizza but a bigger scale because  they've got way more pepperoni in this one here so   without further ado one more quick shot of that  one right over there i'm gonna bite to the other   side as you guys can see there nice shot of  the cheese and pepperoni let's give it a shot a block of mozzarella easy oh wow that is crazy  good well there's a reason each of these slices   is about 400 plus calories guys when you have  this much cheese and this much pepperoni and   of course with the bread you know it's going  to be a little bit up there but as you can see   there is no shortage of the good stuff here  of course you've got plenty of the extramostbestest   action on the very top and naturally  even though the cheese is beginning to settle   it is definitely hearty and of course the little  ringed action with the pepperonis to go around it   i am really digging that this is really good oh  and did i mention the grease is real guys i'm   so glad i have so many napkins under me here right  now because it is a crazy wet oily situation going   on in my car right now but guys a very delicious  situation let's keep going in this is really good and that crust light parmesan at the end you know  i gotta say all the years of doing reviews here on   youtube i have to admit guys even though pepperoni  like i said in the beginning is not my all-time   go-to i can really appreciate the tastiness  of what it has to offer now because there's so   much pepperoni on here one of the main things  that i just don't like about it is the grease   factor because it's just so oily but at the same  time the flavor is there the saltiness is there   the seasoning is there and when you combine  that with the parmesan the butter flavoring   that i'm getting in the back and the extra  cheese just a banging situation it really is   so for all you pepperoni lovers out there i get  it i see why you guys definitely dig it but guys   honestly when you combine it with all the goodness  of the standard stuffed crust goodness that you're   gonna see here but on overload because of  the amount that's in here i have to admit   even though it looks like it's settling on the  inside there's a lot of cheesy flavor with this   i love the fact that it has that extra  meat action because of the pepperoni going   with but honestly i can't help but feel i'd love  to see like a sausage extramostbestest variant   with the pepperoni on the inside as kind of like  the chaser at the very end i think that'd be kind   of cool but guys a lovely situation on this  and honestly it's a banging upgrade to the fan   favorite extramostbestest to begin with and when  you add even extra to that guys this is the extra   extramostbestest pizza as far as i'm concerned a  lovely situation pizza pizza so with all that said   i'm gonna have to give the pepperoni and cheese  stuffed crust pizza aka the super   extramostbestest pepperoni pizza as far as i'm concerned a  rock solid 9 out of 10 guys this one absolutely   delivered across the board even if it was a little  on the oily side because of all the pepperoni that   was on that and like i said pepperoni is not my  go-to but i can appreciate it it was delicious   the saltiness was pretty crazy on it but guys  if you really want my honest opinion again we   need a sausage variant of the extramostbestest  with some pepperoni in the very back for variation   that'll be a really cool combo and i think they  should really do that over here but as it stands   you're getting a lot of cheese on this one all  across the board it's a cheese lover's heaven   it's a pepperoni lover's heaven and honestly you  can't go wrong for the price on top of it 10 bucks   sign me up all right so i'm not even going to  ask you if you're going to give this one a shot   because obviously you're making it this far into  the review you probably already have already to be   honest so do me a quick favor drop some comments  down below let me know what variation of something   like this that you'd like to see on the menu  over here outside of just the standard pepperoni   or sausage do you want to see some hybrid meats  something extra to go into that crust in the back   there's so much they can do over here i don't know  why they haven't yet drop some comments down below   and definitely let me know and with that this  is Ian K closing out another high quality foodie   feature for you here on peep this out reviews  cheaters cam style after hours bringing you brand   new content every single week here on my channel  so while you stay tuned for that next
