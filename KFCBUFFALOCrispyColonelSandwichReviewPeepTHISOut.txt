 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty with KFC pushing buffalo and Honey BBQ with their all-new Kentucky Fried wings I was thinking how could I not try one of those sauces on their flagship chicken sandwich so here we go with the Buffalo crispy colonel sandwich and I don't know about you guys but this is looking like it kind of shrunk since the last time that I reviewed this here this is really looking pretty tiny and when you compare it with my hand here this is very very small I know it's part of the 2 for $6 right now but considering the size of this I think I can see why they can do two sandwiches for 6 bucks let's pop the top of this fairly small bun this is really looking like a crazy crazy chicken little if you ask me plenty of the buffalo sauce in here the creamy Ranchy goodness a decent amount there from the Kentucky Fried wings looking really really nice on a fairly thick piece of extra crispy chicken here and it is definitely not wide but it is pretty thick let's take a look underneath this further we've got some pickles you've got some Mayo so just the standard stuff there but guys again very very small for what this is let's see if the flavor's gonna deliver though it's the Buffalo crispy colonel sandwich here at KFC let's peep out this flavor yeah this is definitely pretty small and at $4.49 by itself for part of that 2 for $6 promo again I can see why they can get away with giving you two of these for 6 bucks again very very tiny it really feels just a little bit above a chicken little as far as I'm concerned guys it is what it is so let's get into this one but before I take the first bite and like always if you guys are fans of high-quality delicious looking food reviews make sure to hit that subscribe button down below and don't forget to tap the Bell icon so you can be notified as soon as new content drops every week here we go with the buffalo chicken little I mean crispy colonel sandwich here at KFC it's decent yeah it's a pretty tasty crunchy piece of chicken for sure although it's not quite on the juicy side and again I know it is white meat I know it tends to be a little bit drier in general but that buffalo sauce is helping out just a bit that creamy Ranchy like consistency that this one has got really goes nicely with the heat that it's delivering and of course it soaks up beautifully into the batter of the chicken itself and that's in addition to the crunch of the pickles all that good stuff as well but again I can't help but feel after one bite a couple of more bites into this and I'm pretty much done with the sandwich already it's kind of a downer I got to be honest but the taste is good it is fairly decent lemme give me that close-up again well it looks like the white meat chicken on this one is a little inconsistent in terms of the size I mean I thought it was gonna be a lot thicker but as you can see it's fairly thin it does have a decent amount of breading as you'd expect the extra crispness is shining through but that buffalo Ranchy type of goodness that it's got on top of it is the highlight so it is a recommendation to get it with this especially if you like buffalo it is actually a very nice flavor in terms of the heat from the buffalo sauce itself I'd probably say it's maybe like a 3 I mean it's nothing crazy there's a decent amount of sizzle to this one but it's got a thick consistency so as you bite into it you're getting that flavor you're gonna feel like you have a very nice type of sauce on top of this as well for the Mayo on the bottom I'm glad I don't have too much on here I'm actually not really tasting that at all because of the overpowering flavor of the buffalo sauce and that's a good thing because that's the whole reason I wanted to give this a shot but again the downer for me at least aside from the fact that the chicken's on the thinner side today is the fact that this is literally a four biter type of sandwich and you're done so you know what I would probably recommend you get the 2 for $6 because I have a feeling after you slam the first one you're really gonna be still hungry it's gonna be nice to have that second on back up still solid though well let's go a little 360 on this one just to round this one out guys as you can see the crispy goodness from the colonel is on display it's a very nice amount of coating the flavor is decent on it not too salty the flavor does come through but the fact that you're mixing it with that Buffalo goodness goes a long way and of course the pickles the light mayo and the fact that the bun is fairly soft really caps off a pretty nice sandwich but do get the 2 for $6 I'm telling you you're gonna thank me for that well I'm definitely glad I checked this one out today because I was super curious to see how this new buffalo sauce was gonna pair with the crispy colonel chicken patty itself and I definitely wasn't disappointed in that regard but where this one ultimately fell short for me was obviously the price for what it was naturally $4.49 for a single one of those for a value sized bun definitely no bueno situation on that and obviously that correlates with the size of the chicken itself because once I popped the top for that initial close-up I definitely thought it was gonna be a thick piece of chicken I mean it looked like it was but once I got into it you guys obviously saw what I got a little on the thin side a decent amount of breading but still thin so given all those factors I'm gonna have to give the Buffalo variant of the crispy colonel sandwich here at KFC just an OK 6 out of 10 this is just above average just above passable I gotta say guys because aside from me being hungry the flavor was actually pretty decent on it and that buffalo sauce is pretty awesome whether it's on wings or just a regular chicken it's pretty tasty so I got a question for you like always right did this one look pretty tasty to you drop some comments down below are you a fan of the crispy colonel sandwich to begin with here and if you are what about Buffalo are you gonna combine the two and give this one a go drop those comments down
