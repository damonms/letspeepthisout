 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty hey everyone welcome back to another high quality  foodie feature for you here on the channel out on   another beautiful day in southern cali right  now guys after hitting up popeyes because it   looks like an annual favorite's back on the menu  just in time for the season of lent only this   time it's under a different name so since you  clearly know the title to this review you know   exactly what it is feast your eyes on the cajun  crispy shrimp here at popeyes and as always a   nice box of fried goodness for five bucks here  so starting off with the obvious we've got eight   of their shrimp marinated in the cajun goodness  before they're battered and fried up to a crispy   golden brown and they're looking pretty decent  of course the side of choice this time you can   obviously tell it's gonna be their cajun fries a  lovely situation and of course the world famous   biscuit action you gotta love that right there  guys for dipping we're gonna go into a couple   of sauces with this one starting off with the  mardi gras mustard and their all-new smoky garlic   tartar sauce which it looks like it's finally an  official packaging which is looking pretty nice   and obviously you can't go wrong with these five  dollar promos from popeyes they're known for these   types of things and actually like i said earlier  with the season of lent upon us you've got some   fish options out there of course shrimp is gonna  be back on the menu and considering you've also   got the cajun flounder sandwich available as well  which if you haven't seen that review it's popping   up on your screen here right now definitely check  that one out you've got more choices than ever   when it comes to lent so plenty of fish action so  let's put this box down and i'll give you another   close-up look at this here they're kind of chunky  guys i really like that so hopefully the breading   to meat ratio for the shrimp on the inside  is going to be decent but definitely digging   the seasoning you can kind of see that peppered  all throughout there and of course that crispy   fried coating let's give this a shot it's the  cajun crispy shrimp here at popeyes let's do it meaty that was a meaty one really good i had a  nice chunk of shrimp on that first bite guys and   honestly the cajun seasoning is beginning to pop  just a little bit here i'm really digging that   as you guys can see on the inside let me  focus this in for you a decent amount of   coating on this one here but considering  the little bulb at the end that i just bit   off this is a very lovely situation in  terms of the quality though pretty nice   and of course since you know this is popeyes  the coating of course is going to be pretty   banging because they're known for it on  top of their chicken so let's keep going in that is really good that is a really  thick piece of shrimp on this one   all right so let's knock off the tail real  quick and actually you know what drop some   comments down below do you guys actually eat  the tails when it comes to fried shrimp i'm   kind of curious some people don't a lot  of people do i'm one of them let's do it   really good and because i got them let's  do a couple of these cajun fries here real   fast and as you can see seasoned up very  nicely let's give this a shot real quick they're really decent i like the  fries over the popeyes they're good   just the right amount of spicing to kind of  let you know that it's got something on it   but they're nice and crispy very lovely all right  so let's get into some sauce action here starting   off with my favorite the mardi gras mustard  sauce a combination of that mustard little   horseradish goodness as well let me grab another  shrimp here real quick let's go for another   actually they're all pretty decently  sized guys take a look at this here   nice and creamy on this sauce for sure hopefully  that's going to stay in focus there we go   kind of hard a little bit on the outside here  filming there but this is fun as you can see a   lovely situation of the creamy goodness let's give  this a shot with the mardi gras mustard i didn't   want to do cocktail sauce because that's so basic  this is definitely the jam so far let's do it oh yeah i'm picturing that mardi gras  mustard sauce on their chicken sandwiches   actually with the coating very reminiscent  little bitty heat on its own actually   on top of the spicing the light spicing  of the shrimp itself but guys the flavor   is amazing on this and if you guys don't know this  already you need to be putting this on just about   everything over here at popeyes it's pretty  awesome let's do it again and just actually   you know what one more quick showcase of that  one there before we dive into the next sauce   oh yeah yeah definitely banging i love the  mardi gras mustard sauce all right on to the   smoky garlic tartar sauce i figured this would  go nicely considering it is fish after all and   apparently with the official packaging here i'm  hoping this stays on the menu permanently this   really looks pretty nice and considering  the fish sandwich out now this is probably   something they probably should have put on that  with the smoky garlic goodness but you know what   we're not about that right now we  are about going into these shrimps   let's give this a shot let's take a look  at it there it kind of looks like a creamy   mayo situation just a little bit let me pull  up another one of these shrimp actions here   give you more of the close-ups i love giving  you all the details of these things here   here we go smoky garlic tartar sauce and you can  tell very rich very creamy on that let's do it whoa that is the one why this is not paired up  in the advertising i don't know this is amazing   that garlic is strong the tartar on the back end  light smokiness actually it's got a little bit of   something extra this is delicious guys wow let's go for a little bit extra on that take a look focus focus   this is delicious mmm oh yeah you know i love  the fact that these cajun shrimp actually have a   little bit of elevated heat going with them right  now because i got to admit it goes so beautifully   with the smoky garlic on this one here the tartar  sauce is pretty banging let me go for a quick   bite of the biscuit before i go for a dip actually  it's going to be easier to get into this container   here we go buttery flaky kind of dense on the  inside as it begins to focus there we go but guys   buttery toasted goodness on this one here as  always the world famous biscuits at popeyes   always banging and because now i've made it  easier let's go for a dunk into that smokey garlic   tartar sauce just to give it a shot and as i've  said in all my past reviews from popeyes mostly   whatever the promo sauce is whatever  sauce it is that you get you always want   to dunk the biscuit trust me it is just it's  something you got to do you just gotta do it the buttery goodness and the garlic it's not  very heavy on the tartar flavor but the garlic is   rich on it wow that's really good and because i'm  curious here let's go for a little of my favorite   mardi gras mustard action again you can always see  the seasonings in there too this is just done very   very well let's do it again hmm they're both good  a little bit of extra heat though i'm getting   from this and it's heightening the flavor of  the biscuit that's always a beautiful thing   it's really good all right so let's go for one  more shrimp actually with that smoky garlic   action because i am loving this here i'll give you  another cross-section shot of the shrimp as you   can see they're very decently sized this time out  i usually don't have this luck you know whenever   i'm doing some of these shrimp reviews here at  popeyes but i've done so many of them at the same   time you can probably compare them for yourself  by that playlist popping up on your screen here   right now this is a lovely situation especially  doing this outside let's go for another bite   mmm thick there's a lot of shrimp in these i'm  digging it that's really good so yeah a lovely   situation on this guys i'm so glad to have checked  this one out here right now now granted it's just   like every other five dollar promo that popeyes  usually has it's just a little bit of a name swap   with this one but i'm glad i'm adding this one to  the collection of reviews here on the channel and   obviously as you can see a lot to look forward to  with the shrimp over here especially if you get it   plump like this this is pretty awesome very decent  amount of shrimp to go around the seasoning of the   coating is awesome and overall a very solid value  for five bucks pretty satisfied with this today all right so getting right to the rating i'm gonna  have to give the cajun crispy shrimp combo for   five bucks over here at popeyes a very easy 8 out  of 10 i'm not going to go much higher than that   because like i said this is a menu favorite that's  been out so many different ways in the past pretty   much the same type of recipe just a little bit of  a different spin on the name naturally there but   considering that flounder sandwich has got cajun  in that name a little bit of heat you're getting   the same type of concept with this but in the  standard pack that you're used to from popeyes and   for five bucks the value is good you've got the  biscuit the fries or your side of choice depending   and eight of these shrimp that's actually a lovely  situation and like i said the quality of that   breading is pretty bagging because you already  know it is it's popeyes all right so i've got just   one simple question for you do you personally  look forward to the five dollar promos every   single month mostly here at popeyes drop those  comments down below and definitely let me know   and with that this is Ian K closing out another  high quality foodie feature for you here on peep   this out reviews bringing you brand new content  every single week here on my channel so while you   stay tuned for that next review coming real soon in  the meantime stay frosty yesir different name or   not this is still classic popeyes and that's not  a bad thing especially for five bucks alright guys   until next time i'll talk to you soon hey thanks  for checking out another one of my reviews but   just in case you didn't see the one before this  one you can find it right up over here along   with what i
