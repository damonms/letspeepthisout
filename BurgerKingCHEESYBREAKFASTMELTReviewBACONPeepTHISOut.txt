 well good morning and welcome or welcome  back to the channel everyone it's Ian K   where today i'm up at the break of dawn at good  old bk to check out their latest upcoming yet very   familiar looking breakfast promo and of course  i'm going to explain so get ready for it because   it's the bacon variant of their all new cheesy  breakfast melt stay tuned because it's up next   welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty yes sir this smells like a very familiar bacon egg  and cheese breakfast sandwich here at bk guys and   without further ado let's do it here we go one of  the all-new cheesy breakfast melts featuring the   bacon variant and as you're going to see guys a  very tasty situation nonetheless let's break this   one down real quick all right so starting off what  looks to be some pretty toasted white round bread   here at bk let's pop in and take a look underneath  and there's your first shot at the cheesiness guys   it looks like we've got one of the two slices  of american cheese there and as we pan down   you're gonna notice we've got a strip of bacon  broken in half and as you can see more cheesy   goodness and that's all on top of a folded egg  and i gotta say this is still looking and smelling   pretty great guys a pretty basic build on this one  but like i said it smells like a pretty familiar   bacon egg and cheese sandwich here bk underneath  it it looks like we've got nothing there but even   still guys we've got the main ingredients cheese  bacon and egg and it's still looking pretty good   so there you go it's the bacon variant of one of  their all new cheesy breakfast melts here at bk   let's peep out this flavor alright so if you're  wondering if they're using the same bread from   their recent whopper melts you would be correct  guys essentially this is the breakfast version   using that same bread so it's pretty much the same  type of thing minus the caramelized onions and the   stacker sauce but even still looking really  really tasty and again a very basic build but   i gotta be honest this is definitely reminding  me of the double bacon breakfast sourdough king   that i reviewed back in 2021 and guys aside from  the extra bacon on that this looks exactly the   same minus the bread not being sourdough on this  one and again all the stacker sauce goodness and   the caramelized onions of the recent whopper  melts it's really the same thing but again a   very very basic build very familiar still  but guys how bad could this be right bacon   eggs and cheese in the morning on some bread  come on let's just give this a shot it's the   all-new quote-unquote cheesy breakfast melt the  bacon variant here at bk let's peep this out yup good though   well it's still bacon eggs and cheese and  it's still pretty banging over here at bk in   the morning guys take a look on the inside again  that folded fluffy egg i am really digging along   with the combination of the melted cheese and of  course the smokiness of the bacon not really too   crunchy on the bacon it's got maybe a little bit  of crunch but at the same time it's really encased   in a very nice amount of bread here and while it  does look rather toasted it's a little on the soft   side but still pretty tasty nonetheless  let's go for another couple on this one i do like the eggs over here at bk they are  definitely fluffy this is absolutely fresh   and it's really set off very beautifully with  a couple of those cheese slices in there so   that's actually winning already and naturally  with the hickory smoked goodness of the bacon   and naturally the bread on this one a very very  tasty breakfast sandwich pretty competitively   priced for $2.99 i have to say this is actually not  bad but considering the size of it it's rather on   the small side guys as you can tell by the bread  the fact that they were originally calling this   the whopper melts was always a little suspect to  me because the whopper was a much bigger burger   but still very cool on what you've got here and  again for breakfast you really can't hate on it   again for three bucks this is not too bad so yes  while this definitely checks off the boxes on   what a basic fast food breakfast sandwich should  have i really wish it had maybe a little bit of   sauce or something extra with it i mean having  the grilled onions or having something maybe   extra from the whopper melt on this one even some  stacker sauce would have been something different   to differentiate it from the other things that are  out there and again it would kind of remind me of   almost like a brunch type of situation and what  i mean by that is if you've ever been to a place   that has like full-service omelette bars where  they make the omelets for you where you can add   certain things to it adding onions and different  things that would have been kind of cool to add   to this just to kind of break up the monotony of  the basic ingredients but guys like i said it's   still a very tasty breakfast sandwich nonetheless  and for three bucks you really can't hate on it   it's really not bad alright so let's go for one  more bite on this one before we wrap the review   up with the rating coming up next but guys even  though i'm not a morning person i'm glad i got up   to give this one a shot because like i said it's a  decent breakfast sandwich for what it is for three   bucks and it's those quality flavors especially  for a fast food breakfast sandwich that really   lights this one up three bucks you can't hate on  it still one more bite we'll close it out hang out well let's just go around the world with this one  guys and again there's really not too much else   to talk about with this one aside from the fact  the price is right the flavor is pretty decent   you're getting a very nice amount of eggs and the  cheese is really nice as well it satisfies for what   it is and again for three bucks i know i keep  killing that one to death it still is a pretty   good value for what you've got here not bad in  terms of the size and the flavor is pretty decent   and hey if for some reason bacon really isn't  your thing naturally you've got their sausage   and the black forest ham variants to go in on  as well so even still you're getting a decent   amount of choice with that and of course it's the  basic choices but it gets the job done and like i   said for three bucks you can't hate on it all  right price point aside because i know you're   sick of hearing about that but truth be told that  is gonna help this one score wise considering the   size of it i'm gonna have to give the cheesy  breakfast melts at least the bacon variant   here at bk a pretty okay 7 out of 10 it's  definitely above average and again one last time   the price point is really helping this one along  aside from the flavor being what it is it's basic   familiar flavor the fast food breakfast type but  at the same time guys it really does satisfy and   it is tasty i have to admit not bad for what it is  again i just wish it had like a sauce or some type   of grilled onions or something from the whopper  melt to really kind of give you that feeling like   it was something a little bit more than what it  is but at the same time it is what it is pretty   much all you can say about it all right so now  the obvious question are you going to be giving   this one a shot drop some comments down below let  me know what your thoughts are on this particular   one and overall what's your favorite out of the  three out of the bacon ham and sausage which   is your personal favorite and why drop those  comments down below and definitely let me know   and with that this is Ian K closing out another  high quality foodie
