pretty unanimous in me heading on over here to give their triple king burger a shot and i have a feeling i'm really in for with this one feast your eyes on a true beast of a burger this is looking pretty awesome starting off with that toasted sponge dough bun on top here let's take a look underneath plenty of lettuce we've got onions pickles and mustard in there and that's all on top of three 100 pure lean beef patties guys one and a half pounds of pure beef and this is looking pretty insane of course you've got cheese separating each of the layers and on the very bottom because why not we've got a fried egg in there as well this is looking absolutely insane so without further ado let's get into this one and see if the flavor is going to deliver how could it not right it's the fat burger triple king burger let's peep out this flavor you know i gotta say as glorious as this looks and as amazing as this feels in my hands right now it's almost a little embarrassing at the same time guys this is absolutely insane very very heavy one and a half pounds of beef and everything else on it but it has got some denseness i mean look at that absolutely insane with that egg on the very bottom so much beef so much seasoned goodness right there pickles peeking out the top this is just looking absolutely incredible and believe me when i tell you i am having a lot of trouble holding this with one hand right now this is seriously a beefy burger so guys real quick before i get into this one or attempt to anyway if you guys are fans of high quality delicious looking food

couldn't be where i'm at right now on my channel without you i'm so glad to finally give this a go to scratch this one off the bucket list it's looking really really amazing it's the fat burger triple king burger let's do this man i don't know if i can get my mouth around this whole thing here but i'm gonna try here we go i think i did as good as i possibly could in that first bite but all i got was a block of meat guys not too much else as you can see there a little bit of the egg on the bottom but there is so much seasoned beef that's overpowering everything and it's absolutely delicious let me go in again i'm gonna keep going in as much as i can to get all those toppings but this is insane in freakin sane let's keep going man this is straight out one of the best burgers i have ever had guys i'm getting everything in there with this one now finally some of the egg on the bottom plenty of that cheese a little bit of the pickles the onions the lettuce the mustard but just a wall of beef this is really a showcase for the lean beef over here at fat burger and i can easily see why this one is the gargantuan on the menu it is insane across the board so insane in fact that if you want to take this challenge on to complete this burger in one sitting there at fat burger you can actually have your picture taken and put up on their wall of fame that they have there as well as receiving a certificate of completion and guys believe me there's been a lot of people who've done it this is insane in general you're gonna hear insane all throughout this review because it is absolutely in freakin sane i've never had a burger like this literally one and a half pounds of beef guys look at the size of this thing it is absolutely crazy you're gonna get close-ups galore all throughout this review because i can't contain my excitement and truth be told i was a little careful on the amount of toppings i wanted to put on this because i wanted to try and have a nice balance obviously of all the meat and cheese but with everything else that this has got with the onions the lettuce the pickles the mustard a little bit more basic but then at the very end having that fried egg in there as well how could you not do that guys but the prep on this one i gotta tell you is absolutely glorious naturally there's plenty of seasoning put on the beef patties themselves and with the fried egg on top of it added to the mix it's a beautiful situation and naturally with all the condiments on top of that even you already know this thing is gonna be a gargantuan i was blown away when i saw this being constructed i knew this was going to be a little bit of a problem to try and finish in one sitting and i can already tell if you can do this in one sitting god bless you because i'm telling you it is very very dense enough talking more eating let's do it oh wow oh my god this burger is not playing around and i gotta say i'm so glad they put the egg in the very bottom because it's actually keeping everything together on this i mean the placeholders are working pretty nicely the cheeses holding the meat together in the middle and the top is three slices and then you have the egg in the very bottom to kind of stabilize it all but guys with no matter what toppings you get on the very top of this it's gonna be a little messy in general but everything that you're seeing here is so worth the time to give a try at least once because it is absolutely glorious glorious insane what else could i possibly say about this all right how about nothing else for a quick moment because i'm going in for another bite i really have to this thing is insane take a look one more time we're gonna go in for that block right over there craziness guys craziness paul thank you so much for the push to get this one done as well as to all of you guys in unison with paul on live stream recently to really have me do this i was looking forward to it honestly like i said this has been a bucket list item to give a go i just couldn't get around to do it and i figured you know what 30,000+ plus subscribers that i couldn't do on my channel without you obviously how could i not jump on over and satisfy the expectation of doing this as well as giving this present to you guys right now as well and as much as this is a love letter to make right now currently this is an absolute love letter to my stomach to give a try because honestly guys i'm a few bites in and i'm already feeling very very full with this so let's go for one more bite we'll close this one out after the rating some more close-ups but guys insane if you've got a fat burger in the area you need to be doing the do and jumping on over to giving this one a shot and hopefully getting your name up on that wall of fame get your picture taken get the certificate it's so worth your time and guys again just insanity pure insanity pure lean beef insanity one more bite all right guys i'm going to try and do this as careful as i can a 360 shot of this one for you the fat burger xxxl triple king burger is no joke it is absolutely insane three half pound patties with this one guys and i gotta say it is glorious as we're losing part of the bun super fresh on that one there too by the way a lovely situation plenty of meat be very careful with the amount of toppings you add to this but honestly nothing is going to overtake the flavor that you're going to get from these beef patties absolutely insane but i think you know that by now right and hey real quick a huge shout out and thank you to victor and the amazing team at my local fat burger here in pasadena california guys thank you for the amazing customer service and just the overall experience in general it was a lot of fun being able to get the footage for this one and i do greatly appreciate the help with it and let me just also say guys again thank you thank you thank you for 30,000+ subscribers and like i always say the best is always yet to come i couldn't do what i do without you as i always say and i love and appreciate every one of you guys for taking the time to take a look at my content to share the content the comment on the content thumbs up thumbs down either way it all counts the same and i greatly appreciate that so with this burger in mind the fat burger xxxl triple king burger i almost don't want to give it a rating because once you give it a rating that means it's like the top that's as high as you can go and truth be told this burger breaks a lot of levels because it's so much above that so honestly if i'm going to give it a rating obviously you know it's going to be a 10 out of 10 i don't think i can because there's really nothing i've ever had that can go against that honestly so let's just say like i said earlier in the review this is easily one of the best if not the best burgers i've had like ever it is insane because of the amount of beef and it really comes down to your choice of toppings being that i constructed this version for me of course it's going to be amazing of course it's going to be 10 out of 10 but guys like i said if you've got a fat burger in the area you need to be jumping on over to give this one a shot at the very least to attempt the challenge that they have there in store get your name up on the wall get that certificate get the bragging rights you know okay
