 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty hey everyone I'm back at it cheaters cam style after hours here at Sonic to go in in their latest burger promo and guys without further ado let's get right on into it it's a sweet and tangy bacon cheeseburger and as you can see a pretty lovely situation of ingredients we've got here guys starting off with a nice soft brioche bun underneath it looks like a combination of honey mustard lettuce and some grilled onions underneath that it looks like we've got some bacon of course and underneath that looks like the cheese that's on here is not quite melted but not too bad underneath the cheese it looks like we've got a little bit of that burger action essentially a quarter pound beef patty exactly but it looks a little on the dry side so underneath that on the bottom there really isn't anything but as you can see not too bad I'm just a little worried about that meat let's see if we can give this one a shot and peep out this flavor and oh yeah you know we're going to because obviously it's the channel you're watching right now guys it's peep this out reviews here on YouTube so before I confirm the hopefully goodness

icon so you can be notified as soon as brand-new content drops every week guys we're after hours here at Sonic it's the sweet and tangy bacon cheeseburger let's do it hmm dry I knew it man what is going on well the bacon and the cheese are fairly decent guys but the cheese not being melted is the dead giveaway and as you guys can see on the inside here it is definitely a dry situation even with that honey mustard I'm not really getting too much else in terms of the moisture department here but guys it is fairly flavorful it's just that it is very dry and honestly I probably should have brought a drink with me but what are you gonna do guys let's just keep going with it but so far pretty underwhelming so far let's do it mmm it's killing the experience for me right now it really is I mean the meat is fairly thick the bun is definitely fresh it's just that the overall juiciness is not there and this is literally minutes old I guess you can kind of tell by the cheese not being melted right away I figured maybe it would melt really quickly because naturally if it's a fresh burger it should immediately begin to go but as you guys can see the cheese is definitely not melted so this feels like it's been sitting for a minute guys the honey mustard though is coming through it is really decent it works really well with the bacon but just the overall dryness of this beef patty completely kills this burger right now what are you gonna do well what I'm gonna do is take one more bite of this and wrap this one up because there's really nothing else to talk about with it naturally if you're not having a juicy beef patty it pretty much kills the whole burger eating experience but hey they can't all be winners sometimes Sonic is hit or miss it is what it is what are you gonna do one more bite will wrap it up after the rating call it a night well the only thing really saving this one are those grilled onions with a honey mustard sauce guys that really is a nice combination and again the smokehouse cheddar that I forgot to mention that this is supposed to be I'm not really getting anything above and beyond an American cheese slice so I'm not really getting any smokiness from that but the bacon is decent everything else around the main star of the show is definitely lighting it up and I don't know about the sweet and tangy I'm not really getting too much about it what I'm getting is a lot of dry beef so it is what it is what are you gonna do well I hate to sound like a broken record right now guys but what I have to do is rate it accordingly so with that said I'm gonna have to give this sweet and tangy bacon cheeseburger here at Sonic a pretty mediocre 4 out of 10 like I said the beef should be the main star of the show on top of all the ingredients on that and believe me that was a really awesome laundry list of goodness that that beef could have really combined with had it been juicier but overall it doesn't really matter what's around the beef the beef has got to be quality and unfortunately tonight it just wasn't the case it is what it is all right so now's your chance to tell me what you think it is drop some comments down below did this burger look legit to you right now have you actually had this over here at Sonic already did I just have a bad experience on purpose tonight I'm beginning to think somebody's playing a joke on me I have no idea what do you guys think drop some comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K closing out another episode of peep this out cheaters cam style
