new blueberry and creme pies so stay tuned  because that's exactly what's about to go down   welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty all right so welcome or welcome back  to the channel it's ian k so let's peep   this out guys feast your eyes on the all  new limited time only blueberry and creme   pie a very luscious situation here i have to  say guys this is actually looking really nice   and it's nice and warm in my hands here right  now definitely digging the presentation on this   and this looks to be paired pretty nicely with  the hot coffee that i've got here all right so   what you're looking at here is a baked outer  pastry filled with blueberry and a cream cheese   type filling and i gotta say the presentation  again looking very nice looks like we've got   a decent amount of each on the inside and of  course nice and warm nice and toasty looking   yeah this definitely feels freshly made guys it's  actually very very hot in my hands here right now   so let me start this off by breaking this up right  in the middle and we'll see if we can try and give   you a nice cross-section shot right away and as  you guys are going to see it first time take a   look at that plenty of blueberry preserves on  the inside of this guys and of course that cream   definitely looking like a very lovely situation  here there is a decent amount like i said on   the inside the aroma in my car right now let me  just start off with that is lighting up big time   lots of blueberry that i'm getting with this  so without wasting any more time here we go   it's the blueberry and creme pie over here at  mcdonald's for a limited time only let's try it oh yeah oh yeah that is a lovely situation already  let me go for a quick sip of this coffee hang on   hmm oh yeah chasing that one absolutely a  lovely situation let me just show this to you   guys plenty of blueberry preserves on this  one very very nice in terms of the flavor   not overly sweet but the fried outer coating  or shall i say baked is actually simulating   fried to me for some reason this actually  feels like a fried pie but it's not not too   greasy in my hands but i'm definitely digging the  overall flavor of this one guys as you can see   the quality is very nice and that cream is not  overpowered by the blueberries believe it or   not it's a nice mix of even across the board and  i'm definitely digging this let's keep going in oh yeah but you gotta chase it  with some coffee it's the best so good on a rainy day no less here  in southern cali this is a nice treat   i am missing the holiday pie i got to tell you  already take a look at that review jumping up on   your screen right now if you haven't checked that  one out i've done that a few times over the years   but this is a nice little follow-up to that i have  to say completely different but i'm definitely   digging the flavor of the blueberry on this and  again a very very nice amount of that good stuff   right there it actually feels like there's pieces  of blueberry in with it it's not just a puree   but of course with that cream going very  nicely with it as well i am absolutely   digging the combination let's keep going  in guys for a couple this is pretty good oh yeah but again you gotta chase it so good medium coffee four cream three  sugar definitely bomb drop some comments   down below let me know how you get your  coffee over here at mickey d's that's like   the perfect balance of sweet and creamy on  top of the flavor of the coffee pretty good   and as i'm about to kill off this last piece of  the half that i'm working on here for the review   i got to say this is kind of reminding me of the  blueberry and lemon pie that i did over at popeyes   a while back and actually that actually had a  little bit more lemon in it but it was really   really tasty and very similar in flavor to this  from what i remember because guys even though this   is not fried it's baked it's actually better for  you and it's actually pretty nice texture anyway   it's crispy the fried aspect of the popeye's  version from back in the day was actually pretty   much similar to this so i'm not really missing  the fact that this is not fried right now but at   the same time very very tasty i'm glad we've got  an option for blueberry over here at mickey d's   about 99 cents to $1.29 depending upon where you  get it but not bad all right so let's knock off   this last little piece of the half that i'm  working on here and of course we'll wrap up   the review with the rating coming up next but  guys a nice sweet treat semi-sweet i should say   and it's definitely made that much more because  i'm having some nice hot coffee on top of it   being a rainy day just a nice combination  one more bite we'll close it out hang on yes sir nine times out of ten i usually dig the  limited time only promos they have over here for   these pies at mcdonald's and i have to say this  one is a very nice addition for winter blueberry   is definitely a nice flavor with this and across  the board you're seeing it very nicely here along   with the cream and again the even distribution of  that goodness all around is very much welcomed on   this one aside from the crust being nice and baked  i'm not really minding the fact that it's not   fried at all it's nice quality overall and again  very very nice and especially something to pair up   with a nice hot drink very beautiful situation  yup some pretty tasty stuff for a rainy day or   otherwise okay so with everything you've seen  and heard of my review up to this point i'm gonna   have to give the limited time only a blueberry and  creme pie here at mcdonald's a pretty solid   8 out of 10 guys the flavor is definitely tasty on  this one especially if you love blueberry and i   eventually guess you probably do if you've made it  this far into the review i have to say that while   i definitely dug the flavor of this one my overall  love for the holiday pie and the pumpkin and creme   pie over here mcdonald's is definitely stronger  because guys those are my favorite after all and i   think some of the best that they produce over here  in general but what you're gonna get with this   is a very nice blueberry treat and i have to say  the combination of everything on the inside again   the even distribution of the blueberry itself  as well as the cream goes a very long way and   the fact that it was super hot paired up very  nicely with the coffee that i'm drinking right   now just a nice combination and again like i said  for a rainy day or otherwise pretty tasty stuff   all right so aside from letting me know down  below in the comment section how you actually   get your coffee over here at mickey d's what  did you personally think of this blueberry and   cream pie is this something that you're really  looking forward to trying drop some comments down   below and definitely let me know and with that  this is Ian K closing out another high quality   foodie feature for you here on peep this out  reviews bringing you brand new content every   single week here on my channel so while you stay tuned for  that next
