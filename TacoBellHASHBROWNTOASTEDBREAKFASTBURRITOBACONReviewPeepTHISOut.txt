right buh-bye alright guys let's peep this out here we go with the hash brown toasted breakfast burrito here at Taco Bell and already the aroma in my car is lit up pretty beautifully right now guys this is definitely smelling like a lovely breakfast situation but of course done the Taco Bell way you've got those trademark grilled marks right there in the very top of the burrito let's take a look at this cross-section shot we've got here is a warm tortilla filled with bacon a hash brown a nacho cheese sauce a three-cheese blend and some eggs so it definitely checks off the boxes and what a breakfast burrito should have and naturally like I mentioned done the Taco Bell way this is definitely looking pretty tasty let's see if that flavor is gonna deliver on this one it's the hash brown toasted breakfast burrito here at Taco Bell let's peep out this flavor everything you love about breakfast wrapped up and toasted to perfection ahhh yes the sweet smell of breakfast in the morning and coming from someone who's not really a morning person as you've heard me say countless times by now you already know this is gonna be a lovely situation because it's already starting off well in the aroma department and that's always a nice precursor to what I think is gonna be something pretty tasty but like always before I get started if you guys are fans of high-quality delicious looking food

breakfast burrito with bacon of course you got to have bacon right let's do it mm-hmm you definitely need to have bacon that's pretty good but as good as it is believe it or not I'm not really getting any cheese yet have a look at that on the inside there guys lots of potato lots of bacon and the egg is there but no cheese to be found just yet I'm loving what I'm tasting already though the flavorfulness and the smokiness of that bacon is pretty awesome and of course with that crispy hash brown it's a lovely situation indeed let's keep going with this one but so far no cheese and I gotta have cheese that's really gonna be the capper for me you need cheese in a breakfast burrito let's hope there's some more in here let's go I don't have any cheese in here what is up with that hmm that is disappointing flavorful but I can only imagine a cheese squirt the three cheese blend some shredded cheese some type of cheese it's tasty though but man now I'm really really wishing there was something else in here besides what I've got because don't get me wrong like I've said the flavor is definitely there it's a beautiful situation in that department but guys you need cheese in a breakfast burrito and I don't have any of the nacho cheese apparently or any other type of cheese in here to be honest but what you've got is a lot of other tasty goodness so it's gonna get points for that but obviously no visible cheese I am disappointed with that but still tasty nonetheless yeah that's definitely no bueno let me see if I can take a bite of the other side because maybe the cheese is just not distributed evenly hopefully there's gonna be something in this one let's go for one more bite no cheese nothing that's sad well that's pretty unfortunate because I was really looking forward to some of that nacho cheese goodness that Taco Bell is known for on all of their other stuff that's really a shame but guys this is still gonna get some points because the bacon flavor is there the smokiness is definitely there there's plenty of egg the hash brown is good but it really needs a shot of cheese and unfortunately I just don't have it right now so it is what it is what can I say what are you gonna do hey well I'm definitely digging everything else on the inside of this one I haven't even mentioned the fact that the toastiness is really nice on the tortilla itself I'm always a big fan of like a little extra toastiness here but as you can see they do a pretty good job and you definitely get a little added crunch overall with this I'm really diggin that overall I just really wish there was just some cheese to go with everything else on the inside of this it would have been a lot better than it is now but don't get me wrong it's still pretty decent oh well so what are you gonna do right well for me I'm gonna have to rate it accordingly so based upon my overall experience right now which wasn't bad because the flavor was decent I'm gonna have to give the hash brown toasted breakfast burrito with bacon here at Taco Bell just enough case 6.5 out of 10 guys you need cheese in a breakfast burrito and that is a key component as far as I'm concerned on top of your protein choice now naturally with bacon being what it is they definitely Rock in the bacon department over here at Taco Bell it's chopped up nonetheless it's not really super crispy you can't taste it that way but the flavorfulness is definitely there and there's plenty of those bits in there so keep in mind I really wish this had cheese in it but that's not gonna completely blow this one out so it is definitely above average but it needed that cheese what can I say it is what it is so guys do me a quick favor drop some comments down below do you agree with my assessment of this one is cheese a key component for you in a breakfast burrito drop those comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K closing out another episode of peep this out bringing you
