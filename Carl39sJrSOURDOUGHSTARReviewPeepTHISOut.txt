 what's going on everyone and welcome back to  another high quality foodie feature for you   here on the channel cheaters cam style after  hours over at carl's jr to take a look at their   latest burger promo which admittedly is looking  a little bit more traditional this time out   that's right so stay tuned because  the sourdough star is up next   welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty yesir it's flavor lit by fire once again here at  carl's jr as we go in and their all-new sourdough   star and like i mentioned earlier while this  admittedly is a little bit more traditional   this time out i have to admit this does look like  a pretty decent looking sourdough burger it really   presents pretty nicely and judging by how buttery  and toasted the sourdough bread looks itself here   i'm pretty excited to get into this one so  let's pop it and take a look underneath and   starting us off it looks like we've got a healthy  portion of their classic sauce mixed in with some   caramelized onions definitely a lovely situation  there and as we pan down it looks like we've got   more of it a very lovely situation guys there's  a lot of that good stuff and that's obviously   in addition to the two nice bacon strips there  along with plenty of melted american cheese and   naturally all of that is sitting on top of one of  the main stars of the show if not the star of the   show besides the bread the charbroiled beef patty  itself 100% pure beef and i gotta say it's covering   this piece of sourdough pretty nicely underneath  it for added color as well as moisture it looks   like we've got a tomato slice as well as a nice  piece of leaf lettuce and a little bit of mayo   on the bottom there as well but guys again it's  all about the beef it's all about the caramelized   onions and that classic sauce for sure along with  that toasted sourdough this is looking pretty   dynamite so let's not waste any more time on this  one let's get into it it's the all-new sourdough   star here at carl's jr let's peep out this flavor  oh yeah a gooey cheeseburger after hours slathered   with sauce and caramelized onions guys that's  a recipe for some tasty goodness right there on   top of the toasted sourdough bread on top of  it again the presentation is pretty awesome   and the smell in my car right now believe it  or not is screaming california classic to me   i reviewed that actually a while back here at  carl's jr kind of like their take on the in-n-out   double-double it was pretty much the same type of  ingredients but the classic sauce was very similar   so a little bit more relishy a little bit more  thousand islandy but still you've got a lot of   caramelized onions on this and that's adding to  the overall aroma in general pretty banging all   right let's get down to business it's the all-new  sourdough star here at carl's jr let's do it man the bread is not toasted i mean it's  flavorful don't get me wrong but this is only   minutes old and it's already very very soggy but  again gooey in the cheese department the flavor   of that sauce is definitely shining through this  really is the same classic sauce from the classic   burger that they have over here but even still the  combination works amazingly well haven't really   gotten into too much bacon yet let's keep going in  oh yeah yeah this sucker is super moist because of   all that classic sauce and again it's giving me  shades of thousand island dressing with a little   bit of relish and the caramelized onions are a  major highlight with this one and of course with   the mayo on the bottom all that mixture together  along with the tomato and the lettuce it's very   very moist but not crunchy at all that's really  the only downside and of course the beef patty   itself not super thick but the flavor is on point  along with that bacon not bad but on the real this   is really kind of reminding me like i said of that  california classic it's just got some different   clothing that's pretty much the only thing and  it's a single patty compared to double which   side note you can actually get this as a double  as well but guys even still the toastiness of the   bread is non-existent there is really nothing  going on with this it's very very soft but it   looks like it's toasted that's the only thing  by appearance is there it definitely looks like   it's got a little bit of crispness a little bit of  crunch none of that whatsoever let's keep going in bacon is banging though yeah you definitely  can't fade the bacon on this whatsoever and   when you mix that in there with the caramelized  onions that is a lovely combination there you got   the smokiness you've got the flavor of the onions  themselves the light sweetness and of course that   relish type of dressing on this one here with  that classic sauce that's what it kind of feels   like and you've got literally what feels like  a very traditional type of sourdough burger   but even still guys very very nice in the meat  department i just wish it was just a little bit   toastier in the sourdough department you know now  that i'm getting further into this i'm kind of   glad i didn't do the double because considering  the width of this patient it's a pretty large   sandwich guys i mean as you can probably  see here it is definitely very very wide   i think it's got just the perfect amount of meat  considering the type of toppings that are on here   there's nothing that really kind of overpowers the  other and it's a pretty even mix across the board   and as you can see plenty of that beefy goodness  to go around but again i just wish the bread was   toasted just a little bit more but even still  plenty of that classic sauce those onions are   pretty banging as well and the combination works  extremely well as you'd expect it to because guys   this is their latest promo i think somebody  approved this right all right so let's go for   one more bite on this one we'll wrap this review  up after the rating coming up but guys again i   really wish it was just a little bit toastier  on the bread but even still it's super flavorful   super moist and definitely fun to check out  after hours one more bite we'll close it up all right so let's go around the world with this  one here and i took off the burger diaper because   it really needs one considering all the mayo and  everything else on this one falling out the back   literally i'm going to be very careful as we  go around very little situation with that chargrilled   beef it definitely is a signature over  here at carl's and with everything else that   you're seeing here as you can see it presents  very very nicely all the condiments on the top   work very well and again the moisture is off the  chart with this one but even still like i said the   showcase on this is easily going to be the beef  along with that bacon the caramelized onions and   that classic sauce it is really a nice combination  if only it was actually toasted sourdough that's   the only thing so with that said i'm going to have  to give the all-new sourdough star here at carl's   jr a pretty solid 8.8 out of 10 guys it loses a  couple of points for the obvious reason that i've   said all throughout the review the bread is just  not toasted it's nice quality of the sourdough in   general and the size is good but it's not crunchy  it's not crispy and for something that's only a   few minutes old that's pretty inexcusable there  needs to be a little bit more crunch with that   it would complement all the other wet flavors  together so beautifully if you can actually bite   into it and feel the crunch and naturally you  dovetail into all those flavors there but even   still that classic sauce is banging all the onions  on that there's plenty of the good stuff and even   with two strips of bacon it still delivers some  pretty awesome smoky flavor on top of the flavor   of the beef banging stuff all right so i've got  one simple question for you considering the bread   is the main thing with this one in addition to  all the other condiments naturally what is your   favorite type of hamburger bun is it a brioche is  it a standard burger bun is it sourdough what do   you prefer personally drop those comments down  below and definitely let me know and with that   this is ian k closing out another high quality  foodie feature for you here on peep this out   reviews cheaters cam style after hours bringing  you brand new content every single week here on   my channel so
