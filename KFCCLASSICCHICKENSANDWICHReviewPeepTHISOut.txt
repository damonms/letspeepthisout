 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty hey everyone welcome back to another high quality  foodie feature for you here on the channel where   this time i'm over a good old kfc for an early  look at their all-new chicken sandwich and judging   by the promo image that you're looking at right  now this is looking like it's gonna be pretty   awesome and as awesome as that image looked it's  nothing compared to it live and i gotta admit guys   a very lovely situation this is looking fantastic  what we've got here is a huge chicken sandwich   officially from kfc to really go toe-to-toe with  the other guys starting off with the obvious we've   got a lightly buttered brioche bun and underneath  it 100% white meat guys that's hand breaded in   store it's also double breaded on top of it 20%  larger than usual with all the classic goodness   that kfc has to offer underneath it we've got some  classic mayo and some sweet crinkle cut pickles to   go with and they're fairly thick cut three of them  there and i gotta admit guys a lovely accent to   what we're about to get into here but very lovely  in the chicken size department and i gotta say i   am very excited to get into this it's looking  really really great and like i said the heft is   definitely there and again guys let me just keep  popping this up for you this is massive this is   no crispy colonel this is pretty much what they do  on steroids and for $3.99 this is already a banging   value so let me peep out the flavor on this after  that initial first bite and then of course we're   gonna get into the detail breakdown here we go  it's the kfc chicken sandwich let's give it a shot oh my god that is juicy whoa okay so are you looking for a competitor to really take it to the other   guys when it comes to their chicken sandwiches  because guys we have got one here with this this   is pretty insane after that first bite which was  a very meaty bite i gotta say that flavor is off   the chart with this one here the pickles are  amazing on this the crunch of course is awesome   but the flavor of the chicken is ultra  juicy very thick white meat on this   with a light buttery toastiness that i'm getting  from that brioche style bun this is a very lovely   situation let's keep going in because obviously  i really want to this is freaking delicious you know i'm almost sorry i didn't ask for some  extra pickles on the side had i known they were   going to be this amazing because the thickness are  on point and i have to admit they're adding just   the right snap crunch and acidity to everything  you've got in front of you here right now   the flavor of the chicken is off the chain guys  it's kentucky fried chicken through and through   but a lot of it it's a massive amount of  white meat and a lovely situation and again   the thickness is crazy all right so let me  just get this off my chest because i've said   this before especially on live streams when it  comes to watching the popeye's chick-fil-a war   it's always been fun watching them go toe-to-toe  with each other and it's really what sparked the   whole chicken sandwich game to be what it is  today as good as those sandwiches are and i   love each of them if you really want to know  who has the best chicken sandwich you have to   put two of the same chicken sandwiches together  and chick-fil-a is not the same type of chicken   sandwich as it is with a traditional fried chicken  sandwich like popeyes with the heavy breading so   you're getting kfc that's got 20% larger across  the board and it's double breaded if you ask me   that's the real competition guys a truly fully  breaded chicken sandwich going toe-to-toe with   each other so i love the whole chick-fil-a  angle but if you really want to know the truth   this is where it's at popeyes and kfc and of  course church's thrown into the mix the real   kings of the chicken game when it comes to the  traditional type of chicken that you'd expect from   something like this and i gotta say this is just  a crazy situation and again i'm gonna keep going   around with this one as much as possible there  is a lot of mayo about to fall off the back here   right now so it's got a nice amount of everything  the moisture is pretty amazing the pickles are   really off the chart with this they're noticeably  elevated in flavor and i got to admit they go   amazingly well with the chicken I think kfc knows  what they're doing obviously let's keep going in and it's crunchy yeah this is so much direct  competition with popeyes because of what   it is guys and especially church's on top of  it too because like i said it's very similar   but a little bit closer to popeye's because of  the size of the chicken and considering the price   point being the same a lovely situation again  those pickles are awesome and again the white   meat on top of it i keep coming back to it because  it's just so prevalent it's thick it's juicy   it's just an awesome show piece of chicken  sandwich power from the colonel and i gotta   admit again guys i keep coming back to it  the size of the chicken is crazy on this   very very solid let's go for one  more bite we'll close this one out   after the rating but as you can tell an  amazing situation with this guys hang on all right so let's do a little 360 with this  one here and as you guys can see again all the   goodness here a very simple ingredients list  but what it's doing it's doing amazingly well   it checks all the boxes and what you'd expect  from a chicken sandwich in the fast food game   only this time it is from the colonel and it has  done amazingly well as you can see and of course   those pickles again an amazing situation just a  beautiful chicken sandwich guys and absolutely   worth the wait well as much as i've enjoyed the  crispy colonel in the past believe me i've reviewed   it actually on my channel as well you can take a  look at the review that may be popping up on your   screen here right now if not the playlist this is  definitely the high water benchmark for kfc when   it comes to their chicken sandwiches it really is  a top tier chicken sandwich and easily worth the   wait just a beautiful situation in terms of what  you're getting with that one and again the simple   ingredients list notwithstanding that's really  all you need it's just a beautiful situation   across the board so with that said i'm gonna have  to give the all-new kfc chicken sandwich an easy   10 out of 10 this one cruised to the top right  after that first bite guys because everything   was so flavorful right up front everything that  was gotten in that first bite was on display and   everything meshed together so beautifully starting  off with the softness of that brioche style bun   naturally the 20% larger chicken patty that  you're getting on that really is evident   along with the double breading you can really  feel how quality that's made of course a little bit   of the mayo the pickles everything together a  very lovely situation say it with me one more   time a very lovely situation all right so now the  all-important question because i have a feeling a   lot of you are going to want to run out right  away to give this one a shot how excited are   you to give this one a shot i mean compared to  everything else out there on the market right   now how important is a chicken sandwich like this  from kfc to you personally drop some comments down   below and definitely let me know oh and real  quick before we fully wrap this up right now   of course there's gonna be a spicy variant of  this chicken sandwich available and you're not   gonna have to wait too long to check it out trust  me and with that this is Ian K closing out
