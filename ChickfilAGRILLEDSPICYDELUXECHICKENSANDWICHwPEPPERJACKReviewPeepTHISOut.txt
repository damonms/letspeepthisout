 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty hey everyone welcome back to another high quality  foodie feature for you here on the channel   this time over a good old chick-fil-a and a  cold and rainy day to check out what looks   to be a spicy little upgrade to a popular  menu favorite but there's something about   this one that's got me a little on edge  and we'll get into that in just a sec   so without further ado let's jump into the all-new  grilled spicy deluxe chicken sandwich and already   i'm digging the way that the chicken breast looks  on this guys it really does look marinated in   some heated goodness there but let's start off  with the basics from top to bottom starting with   what's holding everything together we've got a  toasted and lightly buttered multigrain brioche   bun guys looking pretty nice here on the inside  what you're seeing first thing is pepper jack   cheese now you do have the option to go with colby  which is what this comes with standard or american   but being that this is spicy how could you not  do the pepper jack right underneath that and one   of the main stars of the show obviously is that  chicken breast guys antibiotic-free looking very   nice marinated in a blend of peppers and it's  grilled up very nicely guys definitely digging   the way that looks in terms of those marks on it  they're very cool and of course to give it some   more color we've got some leaf lettuce and two  slices of tomato but guys the big draw with this   one besides the chicken is this all new cilantro  lime sauce which is created specifically for   the sandwich and that's what i'm on the fence  with because i'm not a super fan of cilantro   but even still i'm hoping it's gonna be more of  a creamy lime flavor with this one because guys i   gotta admit this is kind of reminding me of ranch  believe it or not and honestly it really does have   that consistency so let's hope there's gonna be  more lime in this than cilantro but guys it's all   about the spiciness of the chicken itself and of  course with the pepper jack i'm thinking this is   going to be pretty great so let's get the party  started with this one once again it's the all   new grilled spicy deluxe chicken sandwich here  at chick-fil-a let's do it mmm lime with just a   little hint of that soapy cilantro it's not bad  it's tolerable but wow the lime sauce is strong   thankfully there's more lime than anything else  this almost feels like a kicked up ranch with   lime and a little bit of cilantro but guys the  chicken so far pretty good let's keep going in you know the funny thing about this is that  the spice is not really jumping out initially   up front but as you're beginning to chew it  you're beginning to feel like this is a little   bit more heated so the grilled juiciness that i'm  getting from their standard grilled chicken here   is definitely on display but guys i got to admit  that cilantro lime is really kicking this one up   and adding to the overall flavor to it and i  guess maybe a little bit of that lime juice   that's in this sauce has something to do with  that because it really mixes beautifully guys   and the combination is beginning to work pretty  nicely and hey it's also doing a pretty nice job   of masking the tomato flavor guys but so far  i'm not really getting too much pepper jack   with that the sauce is pretty vibrant and i'm  really digging that on top of it so i guess   the cheese is kind of helping to hold everything  together ad nauseum i'm always saying it like it   usually does with these types of things but  guys so far pretty good let's keep going in yeah you know what that cilantro lime is  a pretty banging situation guys i'm glad i   got an extra package of this to take home  with me here right now this is definitely   a lovely situation i think this is going to go  pretty nicely on some other stuff i have at home   but pretty good on this guys i was a little  worried about it because of the cilantro aspect   but so far i'm really liking the sandwich not bad  and side note i gotta tell you chick-fil-a really   has their lettuce game down pat guys i mean the  leaf lettuce on this is really really a lovely   situation it's vibrant it's fresh you can really  see i've got a couple of nice pieces in here and   they really do add the overall color light crunch  as well it definitely tastes fresh it doesn't   really feel like a fast food situation actually  it feels more of an upper scale chicken sandwich   which is i guess the reputation that chick-fil-a  is kind of known for so pretty good guys pretty   good let's go for a couple more bites on this one  i only wish i was tasting the pepper jack just a   little bit but overall the nice sizzle that i'm  getting in the back of my throat here right now   is a nice little accent to what's really a pretty  tasty chicken sandwich so let's keep going in all right i'm about halfway into the sandwich and  now those spices are really beginning to come out   guys it is really strong and i gotta admit for  chick-fil-a it's elevated so i'm really loving   the overall quality the juiciness of the chicken  of course is on point but the flavors of those   peppers and the marination that this has got going  on with this right now is a lovely situation guys   on a heat scale i'd probably say maybe like a  four and a half five but it's noticeably elevated   compared to the other type of spicy options on  the menu here but really really tasty yeah really   tasty and i got to be honest on the real i'm not  really into the grilled chicken sandwiches over   here at chick-fil-a i mean they're okay but of  course i like the standard original fried variant   naturally and even the spicy version of that this  is noticeably more elevated than that spice and   for obvious reasons this is really kind of a  brand new thing and it really feels heightened   so i'm digging it guys i mean it goes well with  the juiciness of the chicken and again coming back   to that chicken i absolutely love the way that  this piece looks here right now the grill marks   are beautiful on it it's juicy it's fresh and  honestly it covers the bun which is a beautiful   situation so how bad could that really be let's  go for one more bite we'll finish this one up   after the rating but guys a very lovely outing  on a rainy day here at chick-fil-a beautiful   situation let's go in well all the juiciness from  the chicken along with that cilantro lime sauce is   beginning to leak out the back just a bit because  this is still pretty hot here right now so i'm   really glad i've got that chicken sandwich diaper  so let's just show you one more close-up shot of   this here and guys like i said i'm very surprised  by the quality of the cilantro lime sauce i was   really hoping it would just be a lime sauce but  i can see why the cilantro's in it for you peeps   who are really down with that herb you're gonna  have something to enjoy with it but it's more   of an accent to the overall flavor and overall a  very very nice addition to this chicken sandwich   and let me just also say the spice is gonna  kind of creep up on you just a bit especially   if you're trying to eat and talk at the same  time guys you're going to be going to notice   it is very nicely done on this and i got to admit  very surprising on top of the sauce so very nice   outing over here at chick-fil-a today so with that  said i'm going to have to give the all-new grilled   spicy deluxe chicken sandwich here at chick-fil-a  a pretty solid 9 out of 10 like i said this is   not my go-to chicken sandwich but what i got today  was super juicy super fresh and the quality of the   sauce overall and the spice in general really lit  this one up on top of the freshness of the veggies   on that guys and like i said the sauce completely  drowned out that tomato and that's not a bad thing   especially since tomatoes are not my go-to either  but the freshness of the lettuce like i said was   on point so overall a very worthy chicken sandwich  to go for right now especially if you like heat   but guys it is chick-fil-a the quality is pretty  banging it's pretty up there i think you're   gonna dig it if you're into just a little bit of  spice but overall if you love chicken sandwiches   it's a great option all right so aside from the  obvious question of asking you if you're going   to be giving this one a shot which i ventured  i guess you're probably going to if you've made   it this far into the review let me just simply  ask you are you a fan of cilantro drop those   comments down below and definitely let me know and  with that this is Ian K closing out another high   quality foodie
