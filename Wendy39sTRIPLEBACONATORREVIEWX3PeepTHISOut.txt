 you already know what it is it's Ian K for peep this out reviews this time over at Wendy's and take a look at a burger that I've actually never tried until right now so I figured from my very first time we're definitely going big so stay tuned because the triple Baconator is up next welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty let the insanity commence I think I'm in for it it's the triple Baconator here at Wendy's and guys this thing looks absolutely insane to say this actually looks like a super beefy super meaty burger would be an understatement because in triple fashion I think this thing is going to completely deliver it looks awesome starting off with this nice soft bun on the very top underneath it it looks like we've got a little bit of mayo some ketchup applewood smoked bacon and American cheese and this is seperated going down the line here guys 3/4 pound of beef in effect here fresh never frozen take a look it up more bacon the cheese let's go down one more layer cuz why not more bacon more cheese now this supposedly comes with 6 strips of bacon here but with an extra patty we're getting an extra slice of cheese and three more strips so it looks like nine strips of bacon and probably half strips here but guys lots of beefy goodness and on the very bottom not like it needs anything it looks like it's just a bun but man insanity definitely I can't wait to get into this right now it is super tall how am I going to bite into this we're about to find out it's the triple Baconator here at Wendy's let's peep out this flavor oh my god guys take a look at 3/4 of a pound of fresh beef in my hand here right now this is looking really really insane before I take the first bite on this one this looks really really incredible why I waited so long to do this right now I don't know but I'm glad I'm doing it right now on camera with you guys in triple form so before I take that first bite to hopefully confirm what I think is gonna be amazing if you

though Oh hurt me so bad but in a good way mmm guys I'm not really gonna edit this one too much we're going straight through look at that one bite of beefy goodness lots of bacon lots of cheese a little bit of ketchup in there but man the beef is insane oh my god I can't get over how flavorful this is I think a double would have been perfectly fine a triple is a little out there guys it really is but they offer it as you can see I'm gonna keep doing this to you throughout this whole review because it is nuts it is absolutely nuts gluttonous flavorful just the right amount of saltiness nice and hot but man the bacon the applewood smoked crispiness on this right now let me grab a little bit of it to pull off for you take a look at that guys lots and lots of goodies very little b-roll with this one guys you're getting it firsthand as we go but nice and crispy nice and crunchy right now mmm definitely not soggy at all Wow all right bite number two after all that because I really want to here we go I'm gonna try and get my mouth around this wish me luck it's a burger that's gonna make you cry only because it's so insane you can really taste the freshness of the beef on this but man it is ultra flavorful this was absolutely made fresh as you can see here it really is just insane so many glory shots of goodness for you in this review guys this is just insanity personified and definitely something I think I would proudly partake in every so often this is absolutely not an everyday thing for sure but guys an insane amount of beef all of you guys who recommended that I check this out I'm so glad that I finally did right now in triple form as promised and I gotta say I am not disappointed in the slightest I'm gonna go for one more bite of this and we're definitely gonna wrap this up can you obviously tell what the rating is gonna be on this one guys its way up there this is absolutely an insane burger with all the hickory-smoked goodness that you know applewood I should say from Wendy's on top of all the cheese and that beef the insanity of the beef on this 3/4 of a pound before cooking and it really didn't lose much in that process as you can see this thing is massive in my hands right now guys this is huge so let's go for another bite we'll finish this one up after the rating but guys I'm so glad I did this I love you guys greatly for suggesting that I do it here we go insanity pure insanity and I didn't even really taste the mayo too much either because of all the other flavor going on with that one just the right amount of saltiness from the beef the bacon the cheese everything together and the juiciness and the heartiness of it was completely off the chain I can easily see why the Baconator is a favorite without a doubt all right so let me confirm the obvious score for you clearly the triple Baconator here at Wendy's is gonna get a rock-solid 10 out of 10 there is no way that burger could have failed as soon as I unwrapped it and saw the way that it looked unless of course the flavor just simply wasn't there which thankfully it was in spades guys like I said the flavor off the chart just the right amount of saltiness the juiciness of that meat the freshness of it on top of the crispiness of that applewood smoked bacon everything in general with the cheese even the light mayo the ketchup the combination it was insane with a soft catcher's mitt style bun guys insanity like I said ok so I've just got one question for you have you ever tried the triple Baconator over here at Wendy's drop those comments down below and definitely
