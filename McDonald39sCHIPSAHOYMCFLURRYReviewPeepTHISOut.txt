vanilla soft serve mixed with a little bit of caramel topping and of course chips ahoy cookie pieces blended all throughout gotta say it's looking pretty refreshing especially on a hot day like today so let's not waste any more time on this one let's dive right on in it's the all new chips ahoy mcflurry here at mcdonald's let's peep out this flavor yeah i'm so down to get into this right now

nice lots of chocolatey pieces in this on top of the cookies guys this is actually really nice i mean it's chips ahoy chocolate cookies after all yeah those chips are really really nice in here and i gotta admit with the vanilla soft serve action that is a lovely situation as it focuses in i was really kind of surprised i was hoping this was gonna be a pretty decent size and it is it's actually really really good for what it is and considering the sweet level on it right now i guess it's kind of perfect that it's this size it's not overly big but again i guess you can always get two right yeah the cookie pieces are absolutely blended beautifully into this they're crushed up very nicely you're getting a nice almost graham cracker crust type of feeling as you're eating this with a little bit of chunky style on top of it and i have to admit the chocolate chips really do add so let's go for a couple more on this one it's as tasty as you'd expect it to be and it really works nicely guys i mean it's a mcflurry there's so many of them that they've had over the years here at mcdonald's and believe me i've reviewed a lot of them just take a look at that mcdonald's playlist popping up on your screen right now for proof of that but i gotta admit this is another one of my favorites and guys who doesn't like chocolate chip cookies i mean come on when you combine that with ice cream especially the vanilla soft serve here with the mcflurries it's pretty bomb all right so let me see if i can scoop up just a little bit more of this here just to show you because guys there's a lot of chunky pieces here and i am really digging that even though it's blended pretty nicely as it focuses in you're getting lots of cookie goodness here that name brand chips ahoy goodness mixed altar out so very nice combination of sweetness and of course the vanilla soft serve over here at mcdonald's beautiful situation guys beautiful situation indeed and hey let's not forget about that beautiful caramel they have swirled all throughout that as well a very nice creamy situation on top of the cookies on top of the vanilla just a nice beautiful combination of sweetness guys as you'd expect over here with the mcflurries at mcdonald's so with that said i'm gonna have to give the all new chips ahoy mcflurry here at mcdonald's a pretty rock solid 9 out of 10 now as tasty as this is and believe me it is because of that combination of the caramel and chips ahoy goodness my absolute favorite i think is probably still going to be the snickerdoodle i had a lot of fun checking that one out there
