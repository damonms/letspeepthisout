 hey everyone welcome back to another high quality  foodie feature for you here in the channel   cheaters cam style after hours a good  old jack-in-the-box because not only do   they have an all-new two for five bagel  breakfast sandwich situation going on   they've also got a stacked version as  well so stay tuned because it's up next   welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty oh yeah guys i think i'm in for it right now feast  your eyes on the stacked bagel breakfast sandwich   this thing is ridiculous and i think stacked isn't  the right term for it behemoth is more like it   there is a lot going on here so if i can remember  what this has exactly what you're looking at is   two sausage patties two cracked eggs two slices  of american cheese and two slices of ham guys   this is actually looking really good makes you  wonder why they didn't just throw bacon into   this because why not but guys it is massive as  you can see and there's plenty of nice gooeyness   on the inside with that cheese and plenty of  meat this is looking pretty fantastic so let's   not waste any more time with this one this is very  hot i've got cheesy goodness coming out the bottom   of this one right now it's the all new stacked  bagel breakfast sandwich here at jack in the box   after hours conveniently this is the perfect  time to do it as far as i'm concerned here we go oh man that's insane already all right before i  break down this first bite for you let me just   say first and foremost i'm not a super fan  of breakfast sausage and regular viewers on   my channel probably know that already right now  i usually bring that up whenever i do sausage   of any type like this which is not very frequent  but i gotta be honest guys this is pretty awesome   it's got like a hickory smoke to it and it really  feels very nicely cooked guys doesn't feel like   it's greasy doesn't feel like it's fried but the  meltiness of the cheese the cracked egg especially   is a lovely situation so i've been stalling long  enough let me just show it to you on the inside   feast your eyes on that guys this is definitely  stacked i only wish i had a little bit of bacon   thrown into the mix because why not  you've got everything else in here   and i got to admit it is a lovely situation  the toastiness of the bagel is a little on   the light side i would have liked  it just a little bit more crunchier   but man look at this delivery mechanism to get  all this into your face right now this is crazy   in terms of the quality let's go for  another bite this is pretty banging definitely banging i almost had a problem after  that bite because of this cheese coming out the   very bottom of the middle of this one guys there  is no shortage of it it actually feels like   there's more than two slices on this but man the quality is amazing the ham fairly lean it's   actually really really good with those eggs guys  the nice light butteriness that it's got as well   and i can't stop showing this to ya i gotta just  keep going in this is really really beautiful   really really worth the money for this one  guys a little over five bucks and i gotta say   it's absolutely worth it again the toastiness of  that bagel itself there i really wish was just a   little bit more but as you can see it looks like  it's not really cooked but it is it's got some   crunch to it it's light but guys the delivery  mechanism to get everything into your face like   i'm showing you here is a very nice combination  really really solid and as you can see plenty   of protein on the inside of this guys plenty of  protein let's go for a couple of quick more bites man I do love me a breakfast sandwich especially  on a bagel and honestly with this sausage being   as tasty as it is it's almost changing my mind  to really kind of go in a little bit more with   breakfast sausage for future reviews because  this is really done very well the sweetness   the hickory smokiness that i'm getting from it as  well is awesome and the spicing is spot on you can   tell it's sausage it's the real deal but man the eggs everything on this this is just very   very decadent so are you tired of taking a look  on the inside of this one i'd venture to guess   probably not if you made it this far into the  review guys this is really a very solid entry on   the breakfast lineup over here at jack in the box  and the fact that you can get this 24 hours a day   at most locations if not all of them is  awesome i love the idea of all day breakfast   and this is a beautiful situation for a late night  and i gotta say guys this is a lovely thing in   terms of the egg the butteriness again is done  very well and as you can see it looks legit guys   very very high quality for a fast food breakfast  sandwich and it's on a bagel semi toasted anyway   and again i'm only saying semi toasted because  i wish it was just a little bit more but guys   a beautiful situation right now i'm so glad to  have given this one a shot and honestly i wish   i had just a little bit of bacon thrown into the  mix that would have been a nice little duality on   top of the sausage to go with because you've got  ham you've got everything else here bacon i think   would have been primo even if you're going to up  the price slightly $5.39 for this here in southern   california is not bad but a couple of strips of  bacon just to add just a little bit more because   why not look what you've got here already why not  give it a go guys one more bite we'll finish this   one up after the rating but beautiful situation  so let's see if we can go around the world with   this one here just to give you that 360 and  as you can see a very very awesome breakfast   sandwich from jack-in-the-box this is an easy  recommendation i'd probably say skip the other one   they have a bacon egg and cheese and a sausage egg  and cheese and just jump right to this one guys   because it's everything under the sun pretty much  minus the bacon but the quality is awesome on it   and the size like i said this is a behemoth it's  not just stacked it's a behemoth order on ubereats   postmates and grubhub yeah i love breakfast  pretty much any time of the day but i gotta admit   doing it after hours on camera with you guys is  absolutely a blast this is super delicious right   now even though it's extremely cold outside it's  cold here in the car the hot goodness that that   one has to offer is lighting me up big time it's  keeping me warm and the flavor is amazing on it   so with that said i'm gonna have to give the  all-new stacked bagel breakfast sandwich here   with jack-in-the-box a rock-solid 9 out of 10  this could have easily scored the perfect 10 out   of 10 right now had they had you guessed it some  bacon on there because like i said everything else   is already there in between the bagel why not  just add some bacon into the mix and just blow   it out of the water the size alone is crazy on  that just diving into it with the melty cheese   is a beautiful situation great flavor across the  board and like i said it's kind of changing my   mind to breakfast sausage because it's done very  well over here at jack and i gotta admit i really   love the hickory smoked spicing that it's got  going with it very delicious stuff and an easy   recommendation okay now the all-important question  if you've got jack in the box in the area or if   there's one relatively close to you are you going  to be giving this one a shot drop some comments   down below let me know if you're going to be given  this all-new stacked bagel breakfast sandwich to   go and if you do are you gonna be doing it  after hours like i am because i gotta say   it's always fun eating this type of food super  late night just saying and with that this is Ian K   closing out another high quality foodie feature  for you here on peep this out reviews cheaters cam   style after hours
