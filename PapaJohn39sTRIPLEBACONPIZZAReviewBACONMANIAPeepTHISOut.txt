 hey everyone welcome back to another high quality  foodie feature for you here in the channel where   this time i'm over at papa john's because it looks  like baconmania is in full swing that's right and   we're most definitely tripling up the fun so stay  tuned because the triple bacon pizza is up next   welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty so here it is the triple bacon pizza here at papa  john's and what's easily the big gun in terms of   the lineup when it comes to baconmania guys this  is looking pretty awesome and not only that the   aroma is off the chart plenty of hints of smoke  in the air and i gotta say guys the bacon is very   strong in this all right so basically what we've  got here is a large papa john's pizza featuring   their fresh never frozen crust and of course  their signature pizza sauce along with their   usual cheese blend but guys it's the triple  threat of goodness that it's got on top of it   here starting off with the smoky crumbled bacon i  gotta say guys very nice little bits of goodness   all throughout this we've also got julienne-cut  canadian bacon which is basically long slivers of   that canadian bacon action and of course guys take  a look at what's finishing it off full slices of   bacon goodness and i gotta say it really sets this  one off in the presentation department and again   very delicious in terms of the aroma it's  really making my mouth water right now   for dipping of course we're going to go in on  some of their awesome garlic dipping sauce but   guys the combination of that smokiness in my car  right now along with just the standard pizza smell   in general is pretty awesome and again i can't  wait to get into this because the aroma is really   setting this one off all right so let's not waste  any more time on this one this is the all-new   triple bacon pizza part of the baconmania promo  here at papa john's let's peep out this flavor yes   sir it's one thing to have bacon on a pizza but to  have it three ways and not only that having full   slices of bacon on top of it guys like i said for  the presentation this is looking pretty awesome i   have to admit again it looks fantastic it smells  fantastic and i can't remember the last time i've   seen full strips of bacon on a pizza like this  i mean this really is baconmania guys it really   looks pretty awesome right now all right let's  put this one down here i'm gonna pull up a slice   and we'll give this a shot man this is looking  awesome look at those strips of bacon guys i am   really digging this here again presentation wise  it's just a standard large cheese pizza but with   a triple threat of pork goodness on the very top  the bacon looks pretty awesome here we go let's   confirm the goodness for you it's the all-new  triple bacon pizza here at papa john's let's do it mmm heavy smoke wow lots of bacon as soon as i  bit into this one it was instant smoke from the   bacon guys a very very nice amount of goodness  here that actually complements pretty nicely   here i'm not sure what's standing out more  it's really more of the general bacon flavor   the smokiness of it but it's definitely got some  textural goodness going along with this as well   you can really feel the bacon strips as you're  chewing this one down the thicker cut julienne-cut   of the canadian bacon not so much the  crumbles just yet but with all the other   goodness of papa john's this is pretty banging  so far let's keep going in guys very tasty that's really good you know i got to keep showing  this to you and if you're watching this after   hours right now please accept my humble apologies  but guys this is very delicious very aromatic   very flavorful in the bacon department i actually  got a decent mouthful of the bacon crumbles with   that second bite but overall the flavor is just  off the chart it's really good cheesy goodness   on top of very heavy amounts of bacon guys  and again that smoke is really standing out   and i mean hey come on i mean bacon makes  everything taste amazing right no matter what you   put it on it's going to be awesome but with three  different variations of it all on one type of item   i'm definitely digging that so for all you bacon  lovers out there i'm sure you're watching this   for this reason alone this is definitely going to  be worth it just for the bacon portion of it here   on top of the tastiness of the actual pizza  itself over here at papa john's very lovely   situation on this and again i really love the  visual presentation of the full strips on this   that's what really does it for me right now  just visually it's playing with my head on   top of playing around with my taste buds in a very  good way so speaking of taste buds let's see if we   can light them up even further with some goodness  here the garlic specialty sauce the dipping sauce   goodness you already know what it is they're  known for for this over here at papa john's   let's give this one a shot yeah this stuff  is amazing i almost contemplated trying the   spicy variant but i probably should have asked  if that was actually still available to get but   even still just with what this is i can only  imagine guys so as you can see as it focuses in   we have got a little contrasty action but  as you can see there we go you've got the   margarine goodness the butter goodness the  garlic dipping action let's just give this a   shot light it up i can only imagine the smokiness  along with uh with this flavor here here we go as soon as it touched my tongue right away   heavy bacon heavy garlic heavy creamy margarine  butter goodness with this oh my god this is a   match made in heaven right now it really  is this works so well especially with this   yeah it's crazy delicious let's just keep going in  guys i am really loving this right now giving you   as many money shots as i can for you as you can  see the garlic dipping sauce is such a banger of a   sauce over here at papa john's pairing it up with  the smokiness of the bacon the cheesy goodness   the flavor of the sauce and just overall the  heartiness of everything it's awesome it really is banging banging and you know what we got three times  the bacon on this let's go for a third shot real   quick for another dip for you really really nice  guys really nice i gotta keep going in hang on man yes sir crazy delicious on this one and i'm  actually kind of digging the fact of the canadian   bacon the julienne-cut kind of like i always think  of julienne fries every time i hear the word julienne   when it comes to food it's pretty much the same  thing they're cutting them in long slivers and   there's a fairly decent amount of them on here and  again it adds a little bit more of the heartiness   to it when you bite into this so again beautiful  flavor on this all around you know what to expect   it's a standard cheese pizza but with plenty of  smoky bacon goodness to go with and you're pairing   it up with this come on guys you already know  this is a banging situation when it's paired up   very delicious stuff overall all right so before  i wrap this one up with the rating coming up next   here we're gonna go for one last one because why  not we'll just do a little bit here on the back   i'm gonna go for one more bite and we'll give you  another close-up shot of a full slice so you can   get another salivating look at this one and then  we'll wrap this one up fully coming up hang on   you know i'm so glad they have full strips of  bacon on this because had this been chopped up   with everything else it really kind of would  have been just kind of a basic bacon type of   pizza but when you have the full strips on this  it adds such personality to it and overall it   dovetails into the flavor beautifully so you're  getting something visually that looks great   and the smokiness that it tastes great as well  very delicious stuff an easy recommendation so with that said i'm going to have to give  the all new triple bacon pizza is part of baconmania   here at papa john's a pretty solid 8.5  out of 10 guys at its core it's a   standard cheese pizza with just lots of smoky  bacon goodness and there's nothing wrong with   that whatsoever pair it up with your favorite  sauce on the menu in this case it's gonna be   the garlic dipping sauce for me and it comes  with its standard and you've got an absolute   winner i guess together that would be closer  to a 10 because the flavor is off the chart   just truly delicious stuff all right so i  venture to guess if you've made it this far   into the review you're pretty much a bacon lover  at heart just like me so do me a quick favor drop   some comments down below how excited are you to  try three different variations of bacon on top   of a standard papa john's pizza is that something  that really excites you and if you are gonna give   this one a go outside of the garlic sauce what's  gonna be your favorite dipping sauce of choice to   go into with it drop those comments down below and  definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K   closing out another high quality foodie feature  for you here on peep this out reviews bringing   you brand new content every single week here on  my channel so while you stay tuned for that next review   coming real soon in the meantime
