 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty summer may be ending the McDonald's looks to be keeping the dream alive with its latest barbecue themed chicken sandwich and things could be a little heated with this one so let's go in on the spicy barbecue chicken sandwich and already we're greeted with that familiar sesame seed bun let's take a look on the inside and see what this one is working with looks like we have a decent amount of this new barbecue sauce which is supposed to be a Southwestern type of sauce with a hint of jalapeno we've got some slivered onions we've got a couple of pickles on here as well and then a 100% white meat buttermilk chicken filet crispy golden-brown fried up very nicely there let's take a look underneath it and it looks like we've got just a little bit more of the barbecue sauce there but a very simple build on this one but I have to admit very aromatic it really smells like a very rich barbecue sauce on this one here so let's see if the flavor's gonna deliver on it it's the all-new spicy barbecue chicken sandwich here at McDonald's let's peep out this flavor not a bad-looking chicken sandwich I mean it does check off the boxes and what I think a chicken sandwich should have that's barbecue themed I mean the patty itself being crispy is one thing not having crispy onions I guess you can take it or leave it with that but the slivered onions and the pickles you got to have that on top of the barbecue sauce all right let's get into this one right now but like always before I take that first bite if you guys are fans of high-quality delicious looking food reviews make sure to hit that subscribe button down below and don't forget to tap the Bell icon so you can be notified as soon as new content drops every week here we go it's the spicy barbecue chicken sandwich here McDonald's let's do it sweet very sweet but I'm not getting very much heat from this maybe just a little bit of a sizzle but it's just an overabundance of sweetness so far a nice crispiness coming from a chicken patty with plenty of barbecue sauce dripping out the bottom of this right now and of course the snap of the pickle let's keep going in on it and I'll give you that close-up well there's a lot of barbecue sauce coming out the back of this one so there's definitely lots of moisture to be had but where it's lacking just a little bit for me right now is the chicken itself is not super moist I know it's a fried chicken patty naturally but it's not super juicy but everything else very flavorful very sweet the snap and crunch of the pickles and the onions are definitely adding a nice little dimension to this one but overall it's just an OK tasting barbecue chicken sandwich with just a little bit of sizzle nothing too crazy though you know I think this one could have benefited from like an artisan style bun or maybe even a potato bun something toasted of that variety that would have been a lovely situation but as it stands there's a lot of barbecue sauce it didn't really look like it when I opened up the lid on this one initially but guys there's a lot of it here and on the bottom especially it is just dripping out the bottom a decent quality although it does feel just a little thrown together it's really just the sauce a little bit of the pickles and the slivered onions you kind of know what to expect but don't expect a lot of heat from this one it's just okay all right so let's do a little 360 on this action and hopefully not drop any barbecue sauce off the back of it here guys not a bad chicken patty itself the buttermilk crispiness is definitely there I wish it was just a little bit juicier but plenty of barbecue sauce and the onions and the pickles go very nicely as well overall it's just an OK chicken sandwich but nothing to write home about guys I'm really diggin the sauce but the sweetness is just a little up there for me decent though yeah I can't say I'm gonna be getting that one again but it was definitely fun to check out at least one time and I am a fan of a chicken sandwiches here at McDonald's in general so I was looking forward to it anyway but overall I got to say the sweetness was just a little bit too much for me and the heat really didn't deliver like I was expecting it to it's not really super spicy at all so with that said I'm gonna have to give the spicy barbecue chicken sandwich here at McDonald's just an OK 7 out of 10 if the chicken patty itself was maybe just a little bit juicier and the overall spiciness of the sauce was up there just a little bit this would have easily been in the eight and a half nine category but as it stands it's just a pretty basic barbecue chicken sandwich with onions and pickles and a barbecue sauce itself that's just a little bit up there in terms of sweetness but still pretty tasty now the question is are you going to this one is shot drop those comments down below and let me know if you're gonna be swinging on by Mickey D's to give this one a go and if you're a fan of spice what's the level of heat that you can handle drop those comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K closing out another episode of peep this out bringing you brand-new content every single week here on my channel so while you stay tuned for that next review coming real soon in the meantime stay frosty yeah this one is definitely at least a 2 on the heat scale at least in my opinion anyway if only they would have added some heat to the patty itself that would have been a beautiful situation alright guys until next time I'll talk to you soon but hey real quick before you go and just in case you haven't already take a look at the last review that I put out right up over here
