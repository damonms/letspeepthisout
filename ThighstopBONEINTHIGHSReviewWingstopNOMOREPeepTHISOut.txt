 what's going on everyone and welcome back  to another high quality foodie feature for   you here on the channel where this time  i'm over at wing stop or shall i say   thigh stop to go in and some pretty tasty  looking bone-in chicken thighs that are   launching nationally across the country  as part of this all-new virtual brand   so without further ado let's get right on into  it guys feast your eyes on the bone in thighs   three-piece combo and i gotta say i'm already  digging all the fried goodness that i've got in   front of me here right now this is looking pretty  awesome starting off with a very nice size order   of their seasoned fries as you can see nice and  crispy nice and golden plenty of the natural   potato skins on all of these here looking really  really tasty and for dipping obviously it comes   with ranch and that's definitely the best thing  to go with but guys the main star of the show   the three-piece bone-in chicken thighs and i opted  for the lemon pepper flavor because that's my   absolute favorite guys but judging by the size of  these i got to admit they're a little on the small   side but the crispiness is absolutely on point as  you can see that pepper goodness is all in there   you definitely have a nice crispy coating  on the outside absolutely meatier than their   standard chicken wings of course but guys i  gotta admit still a little on the small side   but very nice presentation overall so let's not  waste any more time on this one it's their all   new bone-in chicken thighs our first over here  at wing stop a.ka. thigh stop let's peep this out   yesir these definitely look reminiscent to  the regular lemon pepper chicken wings that   i get over here at wingstop but obviously these  are much bigger pieces of chicken and i have to   admit i am really digging the presentation even  if they're a little on the smaller side still   it's a lot more meat considering on the  bone here compared to the wings but again   a little on the small side let me bring  this up for you just to show you again   i wouldn't even say these are medium thighs  they're really kind of small it almost feels   like they're two chicken wings put together maybe  the drumettes guys but still a lovely situation   and like i said the aroma in my car the crispy  goodness the pepper goodness you can smell it all   it's pretty nice all right enough talking i want  to get into eating these right now it's their all   new bone-in chicken thighs the first over here  at wing stop a.k.a thigh stop let's give it a shot come on i already knew this wasn't going to be  bad considering what it is i mean it's a bigger   piece of chicken naturally with all the flavors  depending upon whatever you get over here at   wingstop that you know you know it's going to  be pretty awesome because you're getting more   of it and thankfully it's on a bigger piece of  chicken and i'm down with that let me put this   down really quick here and i'm going to  show you as it begins to kind of focus in   i am really digging the quality of this so far  now keep in mind because it is fried it is a   little on the dryer side and depending upon your  sauce of choice if you go for the barbecue or   anything else it's going to give you that much  saucy action but even still a very nice piece   of meat here even though they're a little bit on  the smaller side you're getting a decent amount   of meat and like i said maybe two drumettes worth  as long as these are actually put together that   way i guess if you look at it really really nice  overall guys let's keep going in pretty banging come on this is tasty you know it's actually  nice and juicy towards the middle and that's   one of the nice things about bone in chicken guys  it's completely different compared to eating quote   unquote boneless wings or chicken nuggets that's  why i opted to go for this you can absolutely get   these like that over here just a bigger piece  of chicken naturally without the bone but even   still very nice quality and again this really does  feel like i'm eating a regular chicken wing just   with more meat so i see what they're simulating  here but guys either way it works very well and   of course you can't forget about the fries right  let me get the ranch action going over here real   quick and we'll pull up one of these natural cut  fries i'm really digging the quality of these   guys they have the skin on them which is kind of  nice you can obviously see the seasoning as well   i really really love the fries over here and of  course with their homemade or house made ranch   it's always a banging situation let's go real  quick oh yeah the tang and the tartness of their   ranch is banging here so good one more time hang  on again really really nice little bit of sugar   there's like the seasoning that it's got here  it's a little bit of sweetness just a little bit   but i love the fact that the fries  themselves are natural cut pretty nice where are my manners here we go let me bring this  up close to you again one more shot really good   and actually before i put this down now that i  think about it how could i not want to go for   a little bit of a dunk with this guys here we go   let's give this a shot really quick nice  little shot of the meat real fast here   let's just get this one coated up as nice as  we possibly can here let's go a little bit   more on the other side there you go dunked  all over the place let's give this a shot come on yep that is crazy delicious and again  this feels like a massive wing the way they're   cut guys i am really liking this right now  i really hope they keep these on the menu   the whole virtual brand of thigh  stop i think that's very cool   just so you guys know this is considered a  chicken thigh it's small but like i said what   you're getting here it feels more like two  wings put together a lovely situation indeed   let's go for some more dunk action because  that was just a banging situation for sure   really loving the quality of the lemon pepper  of course it's everything that i know and love   with that flavor on a bigger scale because  it's a bigger piece of chicken let's go in all right that one was a little dryer than usual  towards the end and i got just about all of it   off the bone naturally but as you can see guys  the fried goodness is on display for you guys i   think this is gonna be a better way to go compared  to the wings believe it or not i am really loving   the fact that the meat is more plentiful on these  and the quality is pretty good $7.99 for the combo   with the fries without a drink you get a dipping  sauce that's actually not bad considering how much   meat is on these even though they're smaller it's  pretty good and hey you could always go for the   boneless versions of these as well which again is  just a bigger piece of meat breaded naturally and   fried to a crispy golden brown they're just  bigger chicken nuggets essentially that was   a dollar more i believe was like $8.99 for a  version of that but guys the bone in is the way   to go the quality is better on it and like i said  for what you're getting for the money it's not bad   and hey another cool thing about this is if you  don't want to go through doordash exclusively   and have them delivered to you can actually choose  the pickup option which is what i did and just get   it on your own so i'm sure the prices may be  a little bit higher i think if you go through   doordash but if you're picking it up that's  actually the better way to do it so let me give   you one more look at this one here so you can kind  of see it here this is more of a full-size chicken   thigh but guys nice quality overall like i said  and depending upon your sauce of choice you have   that much more to look forward to with this a very  lovely combination of goodness and i'm loving the   fact that the skin is really toasted up pretty  nicely here it is fried really beautifully and   obviously with the lemon pepper standing out this  is just a step above the naked wings and honestly   guys a lovely situation an easy recommendation  to give this one a shot how could you not from thigh stop   save a wing at thighstop.com well if it's the  supposed chicken wing shortage or the increase   in prices across the board i'm not seeing any  difference here on southern cali it was the same   price as the regular wings that i would see on the  menu over here with the exception of having these   available now so your mileage may vary believe  what you will i can honestly say i'm going to   be getting that a lot more often if it stays on  the menu as long as i'm thinking it's going to   because honestly the quality seems so much  better it's thicker it's definitely more   hearty and like i said it's more of everything  on a bigger scale how could you not like that   so with that said i'm going to have to give  these all new bone in chicken thighs as part   of wingstop a.ka. thigh stop a rock solid 9 out  of 10 guys the only hit against this one and   the only thing that i can personally see down  the road if i do get these again is worrying   about maybe the size of some of the pieces that's  really the only thing because like i said you may   get one that's a little bit smaller than i think  it needs to be but overall it's a lot more meat   in general the quality is good it's exactly as  you'd expect it to get from wing stop the flavor   is going to be the same but you're getting it on  some really tasty dark meat and i got to say guys   that's my all-time favorite anyway chicken thighs  are the bomb a beautiful situation and like i said   depending upon your sauce of choice you have a  lot to look forward to with this one easily okay   so i've got one basic question for you because i  have a feeling like i always say if you've made it   this far into the review chances are you're going  to be giving this one a go and when you do are   you going to be opting for door dash delivery are  you personally going to go pick it up drop those   comments down below and definitely let me know and  with that this is Ian K closing out another high   quality foodie feature for you here on peep this  out reviews bringing you brand new content every   single week here on my channel so while you stay tuned for  that next review coming real soon in the meantime   stay frosty all right wing stop i mean thigh stop  i think you're going gonna do pretty well in the   sales department when it comes to these bone  in chicken thighs so how about creating some   flavors exclusively for them that you can't  get on wings i think that'd be pretty cool   all right guys until next time
