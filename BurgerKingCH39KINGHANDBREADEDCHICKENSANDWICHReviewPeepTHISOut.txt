 welcome to peep this out  reviews with ian K stay frosty hey everyone welcome back to another high quality  foodie feature for you here on the channel where   this time i'm over a good old bk to check out  their long awaited and hotly anticipated entry   into the ongoing chicken sandwich wars and i  gotta say what i'm about to get into right now   is looking pretty serious yesir serious indeed  you gotta love how these chicken sandwiches look   on the advertising so without further ado  guys feast your eyes on the classic hand   breaded chicken sandwich here at bk and i gotta  say i'm already blown away by the sheer amount   of crispiness on display here guys so let's break  this one down top to bottom starting off with that   shiny potato bun once we pop it you're gonna  notice we've got three large deli pickles and   a lot of what they're calling a savory sauce it  almost looks like a buttery type of mayo and it's   definitely a heaping portion of it for sure and  as you can see as we pan down we've got the hand   breaded chicken breast itself guys done in store  fresh for you and i gotta say this is looking   really nice really crispy and definitely sizeable  underneath it looks like we've got more of that   savory sauce so again there is plenty of it to go  around along with the bottom of the bun but guys a   very lovely presentation on this one for sure so  let's see if this one's going to deliver in the   all-important flavor category it's the all-new  hand breaded chicken sandwich here at bk let's   peep out this flavor yeah i am so down with the  pickles on this already guys and as you can see   by that one peeking out at you right there it is  looking very nice plenty of that savory sauce for   sure and guys the chicken patty itself is pretty  sizable sticking out on both sides of the bun let   me just keep showing this to you here this is  looking pretty fantastic very very excited to   do this finally right so let's see if i saved the  best for last as in the last part of april right   now let's give this a go it's the all-new hand  breaded chicken sandwich here at bk let's do it crunchy well i gotta say right off the bat this  has definitely got some salty fried chicken action   going on right now guys i'm really digging  the overall flavor so far with this one and   considering the outside of the package says ultra  crispy that is absolutely warranted because it is   very very crispy and guys it really feels like an  upscale version of the older chicken sandwiches   that they had here let me just show this to you up  close again the savory sauce itself that's on this   is actually a little bit more on the buttery side  and i'm digging that so it's not really mayo it's   not quite butter it's kind of like in the middle  but it really dovetails nicely with the awesome   flavor of this chicken itself and as you can see  a very sizable piece of chicken it is and i think   you can already tell this is going to be a pretty  tasty chicken sandwich just by the size of the   patty itself i mean i hardly got some of the bun  in that believe it or not it was really more of   the chicken and that's really what you want guys a  lovely situation indeed so far let's keep going in yeah this is pretty tasty it's not so much thick  as it is wide and long and it really takes up a   lot of the bun and as you guys are going to see  here guys a lovely situation with the amount   of sauce and the pickles on this that's the real  differentiator with this one aside from the flavor   of the breading itself you can really taste the  freshness of this one and it really is pretty bomb   that sauce like i said a little bit in between  butter and mayo kind of but more on the butter   side and i kind of like that because it's really  really flavorful so let's go for a couple more   bites on this one guys because it was absolutely  worth the wait and the fact that the pickles are   huge is a major bonus right now i'm digging the  pickle situation along with the savory sauce and   again gotta keep showing it to you there is plenty  of sauce i know bk has a reputation to kind of   have a lot of mayo and things on their sandwiches  this is actually something you want to have a   lot of on this one because it really is adding  to the overall experience let's keep going in yeah this is pretty banging right now guys and i  love the fact that it's coming in the foil pouch   as you'd expect it to and pretty much everyone  is doing that now copying popeyes naturally   and speaking of popeyes for those of you  who don't know the same company who owns   popeyes also owns bk so i guess i was kind of  expecting a little cross-pollination in terms   of the prep in terms of maybe the appearance  and the overall flavor but the good thing is   it's really not like popeyes so it has like its  own unique identifier especially with the sauce   in particular and overall the prep is pretty  much going to be the same obviously it's hand   breaded in store but with the pickles with the  sauce with the potato bun a lovely situation   and again with the chicken being the star of the  show with this one and as i mentioned earlier in   the review this really is a nice upgrade over  the existing chicken sandwich which they only   upgraded maybe a couple of years or so ago since  i've been doing reviews anyway but i gotta say   guys it's like doing it all over again but with  an even fresher type of way to prepare this one   the crispiness is on point the obviously the  sauce is going to be pretty awesome with it   it really is a nice combination of flavors along  with the acidity the snap and the crunch of the   pickles combination together guys is just  banging all right so let's go for one more   bite of this one and we'll wrap it up after  the rating but guys a very hotly anticipated   and well worth the wait entry into the ongoing  chicken sandwich boys here at bk let's do it yesir i was just hoping this was going to be  different enough to really differentiate from the   other guys and thankfully with that savory sauce  it is doing just that it is absolutely unique   in its own way and with the hand breaded chicken  itself here you can really tell this is an upscale   version of what they've had here in the past just  done very very nicely the addition of the pickles   as always a lovely situation and of course  when it comes in that foil pouch you already   know the good stuff is about to be had guys this  is a very very solid chicken sandwich here at bk   and again like i mentioned earlier it's nice to  know that the same company who owns both bk and   popeyes is actually in the game fully across  the board on both restaurants ends now which   is really really a solid thing because guys  like i said if you don't have a popeyes around   now you've got bk offering something very  similar but with its own unique sauce   and that's really the differentiating factor  with it super delicious because of that   so with that said i'm going to have to give the  all-new hand breaded chicken sandwich here at bk   a rock solid 8.8 out of 10 the only thing that  kind of hurts this one just a little bit is the   price point it's not exactly the $3.99 that i was  thinking it was gonna be but the quality of what you're getting like i said is really up there  when it comes to fast food chicken sandwiches   while there's plenty of choices out there now  this is still a very very solid choice especially   because of the savory sauce that's what really  does it for me on top of the pickles of course   okay now the obvious question if you're a fan of  chicken sandwiches in general which you probably   are if you've made it this far into the review how  excited are you personally to give this one a shot   drop some comments down below have you tried all  the other guys were you waiting for bk to come out   with their variant drop those comments down below  and definitely let me know and with that this is   Ian K closing out another high quality foodie  feature for you here on peep this out reviews   bringing you brand new content every single
