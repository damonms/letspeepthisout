 what's going on everyone and welcome or  welcome back to the channel it's Ian K   where today i'm over at carl's jr because  just in time for the new jurassic park movie   we've got a brand new promo menu to go in on  that's right so stay tuned because i've got   the primal angus thickburger up next welcome  to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty well i sure do think good old dr hammond would  be super proud of this one guys feast your eyes   on the primal angus thickburger over here at  carl's jr and guys we've got a nice little meaty   situation to go in on let's break this one down  real fast it's flavor lit by fire featuring 100%   angus beef with this all new primal angus thick  burger and i got to say guys the presentation is   looking pretty nice a fairly decent sized potato  bun here let's pop it and take a look underneath   and it looks like we've got a little of what  they're calling amber barbecue sauce more on that   in just a second but as we pan down guys you're  gonna notice one of the main stars of the show   sliced prime rib and i gotta say it's a fairly  decent amount and it looks very nice on top of   this beef and speaking of that beef again it's  that 100% angus beef patty the thick burger   goodness over here at carl's jr featuring a slice  of smoked cheddar to go with along with more of   that amber barbecue sauce which is basically  a carolina barbecue sauce and you can really   smell it in the car very nicely it's really nice  and sweet with little notes of mesquite goodness   for sure and underneath that you're going to find  two of their classic onion rings along with more   of that amber barbecue sauce aka the carolina  barbecue sauce but guys the beef is looking   pretty awesome and again coming back to that prime  rib it is looking very nice on top of this let's   not waste any more time on this one guys let's get  into it it's the all-new primal angus thick burger   here at carl's jr celebrating the release of  jurassic park dominion let's peep out this flavor   yeah this is checking off all the lovely  situation boxes with this guys and i gotta   say i am totally digging the presentation of  this one along with that smoked cheddar this   is really looking pretty good but i got to be  real this is kind of reminding me of the prime   rib and cheddar angus thick burger that i reviewed  back in 2020 i think it was back in september so   take a look at that review jumping up on your  screen just to refresh yourself with that one   this looks like a retread of that with a little  bit of a different barbecue sauce but guys even   still this is looking pretty banging without  further ado let's confirm hopefully the goodness   with this one it's the all-new primal angus thick  burger here calls junior let's peep this out oh oh right off the break that mesquite-like  smokiness of that carolina barbecue sauce aka   the amber barbecue sauce is really lighting this  one up guys i have to say that's a very nice   combination along with the angus beef which  is very soft very flavorful and i gotta say   very juicy at the same time guys feast  your eyes right after this first bite   not too much of the prime rib just yet but  the burger is setting it off beautifully with   that barbecue sauce i gotta say that is  really nice combo along with that smoked   cheddar which i can actually taste with  this on top of that barbecue sauce but   pretty lovely let's not forget about that potato  bun very soft here we go we're going in again mmm oh prime rib is banging on this wow definitely a  carnivorous situation with this i guess the only   thing that's really missing is some bacon but i  think that would have overpowered just a little   bit of what i've got here guys because even still  the quality of that prime rib is awesome on this   it goes amazing with the burger and again that  smoked cheddar is a major upgrade compared to   the last time around along with that carolina  barbecue sauce aka the amber barbecue sauce   again very very tasty on this and of course  with the crispy onion rings on the bottom a   very flavorful situation all around you know  considering the price point of this one i get   the whole licensing aspect of it but here in  southern cali this is $9.99 for a single but   it's a sizable single considering the type of  patty that it's got i mean it's the angus thick   burger goodness naturally it's very meaty very  wide and again just to keep showing it to you   that prime rib is a lovely situation thankfully  i've got a very decent amount on here and while   it doesn't look as high as the ad naturally what  you're getting is a lot of carnivorous goodness   in every bite and the flavor is pretty banging  let's go for another couple of bites on this i love how juicy the beef is it's really good   yeah this really does feel like the prime rib and  cheddar angus thickburger 2.0 guys it really is a   major upgrade over the original one that i tried  and even still like i said with the prime rib being   as tender as it is it's so much more of a better  flavor profile along with that carolina barbecue   sauce aka the amber barbecue sauce i know it's  the whole movie tie-in thing but i love the fact   that it's that golden goodness they're trying  to simulate that on top of being carnivorous so   i can see carl's jr really capitalizing on  that whole thing and guys again the quality   of everything on this one is pretty sizable and  considering that potato bun being what it is   it is pretty decent but again $9.99 for this what  are you gonna do well what i'm gonna do is go in   on one more bite of this one before we wrap  the review up with the rating coming up next   and while we all wait for the latest jurassic park  movie to come out to close out the current trilogy   let's just say guys this is a very fun promo  and a lot more to go in on over here at carl's   jr which you're going to see here on the channel  in the near future you're probably seeing some   video up on your screen here right now to showcase  all the other goodies they've got let's just say   you've got a lot to look forward to all right  guys one more bite and we'll close it out hang out yes sir pretty nice textual profile with  this one along with the flavorfulness of   everything guys those crunchy onion rings  really dovetail very nicely with all the   meaty aspects of this burger along with the smoked  cheddar which i can actually taste and of course   that carolina aka amber barbecue sauce really  dovetailing with everything else on here on   top of the softness of the potato bun a banging  situation on this one in a fun movie tie-in   so with that said i'm going to have to give the  all-new primal angus thick burger aka the prime   rib and cheddar angus thickburger 2.0 here at  carl's jr a pretty rock solid   8.5 out of 10 guys the only thing really hurting this one  is the price point i mean at $9.99 it's definitely   up there and maybe adding a little bit of bacon  for those of you guys who really want an ultimate   carnivore type of burger that would have been the  way to go but i can see what they're going for   with this one by showcasing that amber barbecue  sauce along with the smokiness overall of that   cheddar and then naturally with the tenderness  of the prime rib and of course the angus thick   burger itself overall a very banging situation  and again a fun movie tie-in all right so do me   a quick favor drop some comments down below first  and foremost let me know how excited you are to   check out the all-new jurassic park dominion film  coming out this summer to close out the current   jurassic world trilogy and overall what did you  think of this all new
