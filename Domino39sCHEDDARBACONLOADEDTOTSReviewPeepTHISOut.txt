 [Music] welcome to peep this out reviews with  Ian K stay frosty what's going on everyone   and welcome to the channel where today I'm over at  Domino's to check out their first major promo for   2023 that's actually looking pretty loaded and  guys not only that it also features a first for   them too that's right guys you already know it's  potato tots over here at Domino's for the very   first time and naturally it's going to be down  to Domino's ways let's take a look at one of them   right now and as you can see cheddar bacon loaded  Tots in effect guys this is looking very nice with   that sauce on top let's break this one on down  for you real fast that's right guys completely   random tots over here at Domino's this is pretty  crazy so guys what you're looking at here for this   version is a portion of their golden brown potato  tots that are topped off with Smoky bacon a blend   of cheese made from mozzarella and cheddar and  a nice heavy-handed drizzle of garlic Parmesan   sauce guys very much comfort food for what you've  got in front of you here right now and I gotta say   the aroma of those tots and everything on this  is lighting up my car pretty beautifully the   presentation is pretty solid and this actually  fills out the box pretty nicely as well not bad   in that department all right so there you go let's  see if the flavor is going to deliver on this one   these are the all new cheddar bacon loaded tots  over here at Domino's let's peep out this flavor   yeah man this definitely looks like something  out of left field but at the same time it looks   very very gluttonous and very tasty guys I have to  admit all right now naturally with touch you kind   of want to use your fingers but this one has got a  lot of toppings on it here so what I'm going to do   is take a trusty Fork naturally and uh we'll get  this going here so let me lift up some of these   this is looking pretty nice plenty of bacon here  very nice indeed along with that cheese action   and I'm kind of destroying this one here  but here you go a little bit of everything   there that garlic Parmesan sauce of course  we've got the cheddar action the bacon the   tots themselves looking nice and brown  very cool let's give this a shot guys   here we go finally it's the cheddar bacon  loaded Tots at Domino's let's peep this out you know this is not going to be bad  right I mean come on mmm Crispy Crunchy on those   tots the bacon the cheese and the pungentness  of that garlic Parmesan sauce pretty banging   yeah man the baked goodness on these tots are  pretty awesome guys and naturally with the   cheese and the bacon and everything else this one  has here let me try and lift up one of these as   you can see it's a little bit congealed together  we're gonna get this to go come on come on it's   pulling it's pulling it's cheddar very nice guys  very nice indeed the garlic Parmesan sauce is a   major highlight with this I think even without  it it would be decent but that added zip that   I'm getting from the garlic and of course the  cheesier flavor pretty nice let's keep going in excellent accent almost like a ranch type  goodness that I'm tasting right now but   it's Parmesan it's creamy garlic is good and  again it's tots over at Domino's who would have   thought guys that is pretty crazy so let's go  for another one here and as that's a bite right   there I'm gonna try and take this down lovely  situation with that sauce guys very tasty we're   gonna go for a couple more bites on this but  it's gluttonous almost like a potato au gratin   situation with the cheese the garlic parmesan  and the smokiness of the bacon it's pretty nice mmm oh yeah yeah tons of flavor on this guys  and not a lot of salt believe it or not I mean   the flavor of that garlic parmesan is the  instant standout along with the smokiness   of the bacon and of course the crispiness  of the tots themselves very gluttonous on   this one guys very gluttonous indeed so let's go  for one more bite we'll wrap this little quickie   review up with the rating coming up next  but a lovely combination of cheddar action   take a look at that there very nicely done and  again tots at Domino's who would have thought   pretty tasty let's go for one more bite and we'll  wrap this one up hang on come on this is good   so yeah guys a tasty little side item over  here at Domino's I have to admit very random   very different and actually with all the stuff  that they have on the top of this they pretty   much put on their pizzas anyway you have a nice  combination of flavor with this one the hickory   smoked bacon the garlic parmesan absolutely and  the blend of the mozzarella and cheddar together   I mean with those toppings there's no way this can  really fail unless it's just not made correctly   and this actually is made very nicely it's  definitely something worth checking out and I'd   highly recommend you do so not bad with this one  so with that said I'm gonna have to give these all   new cheddar bacon loaded tots here at Domino's a  pretty solid 8 out of 10 guys like I said there's   no way this can really fail unless it's just  not made correctly but the combination of the   cheeses in general along with the garlic Parmesan  sauce that instantly rates right away because the   combination works extremely well on top of the  bacon and guys just so you know there's actually   two other ones on top of this one actually that  you're going to be seeing here on the channel   you're probably seeing them up on your screen  here right now look forward to those but for   this variation the garlic parmesan is banging an  easy recommendation to give this one a shot first   pretty tasty all right so do me a quick favor like  always drop those comments down below let me know   what you thought of these cheddar bacon loaded  tots here at Domino's does it seem like it's   completely random to you as well and out of the  two other ones that are available in that little   clip you saw in the beginning of this review  which are you most looking forward to trying   first out of those drop those
