 hey everyone welcome back to another high quality  foodie feature for you here on the channel   cheaters cam style after hours over at carl's jr  because it looks like they've upgraded a few of   their burgers with some awesome 100% angus beef  action and you better believe we're taking a   look at one of them so stay tuned because  the guacamole bacon angus burger is up next   welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty it's flavor lit by fire here at carl's jr after  hours with our guacamole bacon angus burger and   already we are in for one messy situation here  guys take a look at all that guacamole falling off   the front of this one here in the front it looks  really really awesome let's pop the top of this   potato bun and see what we've got underneath it  and actually it looks like a decent amount of that   santa fe sauce that orange sauce is all across the  top and as you can see it dovetails right into all   the guacamole underneath it and guys there is a  decent amount of that guacamole as well we've got   two strips of bacon mixed in with some pepper jack  cheese on top of it guys and again a very messy   situation of goodness that's all sitting on top of  a third pound charbroiled angus beef patty 100% and   i gotta say it is very sizable here for sure and  as usual i'm definitely digging those grill marks   for this one here and on the very bottom it looks  like we've got the usual lettuce tomato and red   onion and underneath that even more of the santa  fe sauce but guys lots of goodness here there is a   massive ingredients list with this one and i gotta  say it's looking pretty tasty so let's see if i   can confirm the awesomeness for you flavor-wise  this is the all-new guacamole bacon angus burger   here at carl's jr let's peep out this flavor yeah  definitely a messy situation they pretty much   threw everything but the kitchen sink at this one  guys look at all of those ingredients along with   that angus beef patty that's buried in there and  i gotta say it is pretty awesome especially with   this potato bun on top of it very excited to do  this especially after hours so without further ado   let's do just that it's the all-new guacamole  bacon angus burger here at carl's let's hit it well it's not just a messy situation it's  an ultra creamy situation on top of it and   you'd kind of expect that with the amount of  guacamole that's on this guys but actually   when that's blending with the santa fe sauce  it's giving a little bit of sizzle to it on   top of it so that flavor is beautiful  a little bit of an elevated spice that   i'm getting on top of the creaminess of the  guac but guys then right into that angus beef   patty action and then some of the hickory  smoke of the bacon pretty lovely situation   let's go for another bite we'll give you  some close-ups this is pretty delicious well i gotta say i'm really digging the way the  smokiness of that bacon is really adding to the   overall flavor of this one guys that angus beef  is really shining through as well that quality   is really really on display with this one here  and all of the condiments around it are really   lighting up beautifully again i just wish  the bacon was a little bit crispier but guys   super flavorful so far and the main reason  for that is easily going to be the guacamole   and that santa fe sauce along with the bacon  because that's really the dominant flavors that   i'm getting here and then the beef comes in right  away right after that and guys the quality again   very very nice over here at carl's jr similar  to hardee's if you guys have that in your area   this is really really delicious i only  wish i can taste the cheese but again   it's kind of the placeholder to hold all this  together but considering how much guacamole and   everything that's on this right now i don't  really mind that it's kind of blending in   with everything guys because the flavor of  those other ingredients are taking this one   to new heights right now let's go in for  another couple of bites guys pretty tasty well i gotta say this is easily turning into one  of the times where i'm glad there are so many   condiments on this burger right now because  it's really helping to mask the tomatoes in   the very bottom of this i can kind of taste them  trying to come through but the dominant flavors   of the guacamole and the santa fe sauce the  smokiness of the bacon it's doing a beautiful   job of masking the situation that i have in  front of me here right now and guys honestly   i am so impressed with the size of the burger  considering the price point of this one   a little over nine dollars very very expensive  for this but again the quality is pretty banging   and while i am a fan of the guacamole even if  i wasn't there is a jalapeno and an original   variant on the menu that you can also go with  as well but guys the quality of the meat alone   is the main showpiece for this one on top of  the guacamole variant that i'm having right now   guys just super delicious all around and that  obviously includes this oversized potato bun   which is actually i think a first i don't  think i've ever really had a potato bun   over here at carl's jr that i can remember  being that i've done so many reviews here   but guys a lovely situation on this one i'm super  glad to be giving this one a shot after hours   and hey it's a really delicious bacon cheeseburger  after hours from carl's jr how bad could that   really be right one more bite we'll close this  one up after the rating guys pretty delicious so as you can see that tomato hanging off the  end over there is no match for the guacamole and   santa fe combo when it comes to the flavor  on this one guys and as you can see here   a lovely situation of goodness without a doubt on  this one here i'm really digging the quality of   the flavors on this one and the guacamole makes  a huge difference along with the santa fe sauce   and the smokiness of the bacon to go with  dovetailing right into all little crunchies   of the onions on the bottom the lettuce and  everything else on this one here aside from   the pepper jack cheese but even still this is  a super delicious cheeseburger very very nice   a super delicious bacon cheeseburger we can't  forget about the bacon this is pretty awesome   on this one so overall i'm gonna have to give the  guacamole bacon angus burger here at carl's jr a   pretty solid 8 out of 10 and the only  reason i'm not going much higher than that   is the price point guys i mean at almost nine  dollars or a little over in my case it's very very   expensive and considering what it is i know it's  a delicious burger and all the quality is high   but when you're getting close to the double digits  for a burger without a drink and without fries   come on i mean that's a little bit up there right  and hey i know i live in southern cali where the   national average for most fast food items tends  to skew a little bit higher than normal but even   still ten dollars pretty much close to that  with tax gotta say guys i feel just a little   bit taken advantage of even though it was a pretty  delicious burger but even still what are you gonna   do well actually what i'm gonna do is ask you if  you're gonna be giving this one a shot if you've   got carl's jr in the area drop some comments down  below are you going to be giving this one a go and   if you've got hardee's in the area do they even  have this on the menu over there for you guys   drop those comments down below and definitely let  me know and with that this is Ian K closing out   another high quality foodie feature for you here  on peep this out reviews cheaters cam style
