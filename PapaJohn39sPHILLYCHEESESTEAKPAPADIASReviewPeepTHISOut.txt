it's up next welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty so it looks like we've got some handheld happiness from Papa John's in store for us with their all-new Philly cheesesteak Papadia and I gotta say this looks pretty nice guys the smell of that pizza dough is glorious in the car right now definitely freshly made and the smell of the peppers is coming through just as well let me swing this box around we'll get a closer look at this one billed as part Pizza part sandwich all delicious the smell is glorious and of course we've got the nice toastiness of everything and we lift this one up here we'll take a look on the inside all the Philly cheesesteak goodness this is burning hot we got to do this quick we've got some Philly sauce we've got some cheese we've got some steak onions and green peppers all on the inside of what you're seeing here and guys I got to say this actually feels really really nice it feels as thin as a quesadilla but definitely packed right here in the middle as my fingers are pressing into this but lovely situation of course for dipping we have got some of their special garlic sauce my all-time favorite I can't wait to get into this but guys let's get into this right now the toastiness the smell the aroma and everything this one has to offer I think is gonna deliver its the Philly cheesesteak Papadia here at Papa John's let's peep out this flavor yeah glorious isn't the word the freshly made pizza dough is easily the standout of this right now in the aroma department on top of those peppers so I'm very excited to bite into this but before I do in like always if you guys are fans of high-quality delicious looking food reviews make sure to hit that subscribe button down below and don't forget to tap the Bell icon so you could be notified as soon as brand new content drops every week guys the Philly cheesesteak Papadia got to admit I really like the name of this one let's give it a shot blast of cheese and meat all ready mm mm hmm the onions that's a lovely situation that Philly sauce along with the cheese they're using in this gives it a nice very thick dense type of bite and then you get to meat the cheese everything together all in one but that initial blast of the meat and cheese that I got right there was a very nice beginning to what's already a pretty nice experience the dough itself a little on the thin side it's supposed to be simulating a quesadilla after all part Pizza part quesadilla and I'm saying quesadilla because it's actually closer to that than a sandwich in my opinion anyway I mean the thinness of the dough really kind of speaks for itself it feels more like a flat type of tortilla but more Italian style because you're getting that feeling like it's like a pizza but then again it's not because it's Philly cheesesteak so it doesn't have the Omarosa roll and I'm cool with that but I like the idea of all the flavors melding together beautifully let's go for one more bite and I'll give you another one of these close-ups guys it's delicious I'm glad I started with this one mmm well I gotta say I don't think the $6 price point is too bad for what you're getting here it's essentially a hybrid quesadilla with a really nice amount of flavor coming from that Philly cheese goodness on the inside and while it's a little on the thinner side it does pack a nice wallop right there in the middle guys as it's folded over that's where you're gonna get a bulk of that topping right there and it's really delicious but of course the part that I think that's gonna make it even more delicious than it already is is going for a dip in my all-time favorite that special garlic dipping sauce let's do that all right how bad can this really be compared to their regular pizza and considering this is essentially that same pizza dough I think this is gonna go very nicely let's get it nice and coated up here and go for a nice bite with it let's do it and yes it even smells more heavily than it already does here we go this is amazing life-changing all the time hmm you know with the peppers and the onions I think this garlic sauce is perfectly paired with this because that extra garlic that I'm getting is simulating like marinated grilled onions on a regular Philly cheese and guys it just adds overall to the experience because the creaminess is there and in this case the butteriness is going with it but guys everything else along with this with the cheese the meat heavenly guys and I really can't say it any better than that because it truly is this stuff is life-changing with anything you put it on over here and with these new papadias it's no exception mmm man I love it with the cheese and all that meat it's really good you know one thing I like about this is how its prepared this is actually made open-faced in their ovens and then they simply cut it and then fold it over so it really is kind of like a mini pizza just flipped over and cut down the middle but the fact that it's made that way you can really appreciate the toastiness of that crust because it is perfectly browned of course it's fresh dough on top of it and with my topping of choice for this review in this case the Philly cheesesteak I'm glad I had a chance to see how this was prepared and I'm enjoying it right out the oven so one more bite with this one guys I'm definitely gonna go for more of this garlic dipping sauce here and we'll wrap this one up with a rating after another close up let's do it so good all right so let's go a little 360 here and I'll split this one at the very end for you so you can see the insides but guys a very nice quesadilla hybrid here from Papa John's I love the concept of it it's very simple but I love the idea of the execution being what it is and with the topping being the Philly cheesesteak goodness that you see there it is just a lovely situation essentially a mini pizza flipped over with a dipping sauce but guys a very lovely situation what is not to like about this well that's not a bad back up to an original Philly cheesesteak sandwich of course being what it is you really can't compare it fully because naturally Philly cheesesteak on its own especially the OG Philly back in Philadelphia is the bomb but when it comes to a hybrid version in pseudo pizza form it's not quite a sandwich not quite a pizza a little bit in the middle I would say it a little bit closer to a quesadilla that definitely fits the bill and I would easily recommend that one delicious stuff so for the execution flavor an overall presentation of everything with this one today I'm gonna have to give the Philly cheesesteak papadia here at Papa John's a pretty rock-solid 10 out of 10 it was hot fresh delicious and with that garlic dipping sauce that really was the icing on the cake and it really is the perfect pairing for that because it really brought out the fullness of those onions and the peppers themselves just a very delicious sandwich over here at Papa John's now of course the obvious question is did this look pretty delicious to you do me a quick favor drop some comments down below first and foremost are you a fan of Philly cheesesteak in
