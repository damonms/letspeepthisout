 here we go with another high quality foodie  feature for you here on the channel where this   time i'm headed into pizza hut to pick up what  looks to be a nicely wrapped tasty looking box   meal just in time for the holidays that's right so  stay tuned because the triple treat box is up next   welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty well this should be a lot of fun i mean i've never  done like a whole box meal situation over here at   pizza hut with like dessert and bread sticks and  all that stuff here so let me pull off to the side   here we'll pick this up curbside and then we'll  get it going hey how you doing awesome thank you   wow this box is huge happy holidays  to you stay frosty we'll see ya   that is a huge box guys let's peep this out so  here we go with the triple treat box here at pizza   hut but as you can see we've got four total items  on display here guys so if you ask me this should   really be called the quadruple treat box but i  digress it's still looking pretty tasty so let's   get started with one of the two medium one-topping  pizzas and obviously we're going to begin with   pepperoni and i got to admit guys these are  looking pretty good as you can see the pepperoni   is looking curled up i am definitely digging  that it's the standard cheese the standard crust   of course as you can see here of course we've got  that wash in the very back of olive oil and garlic   and obviously the classic marinara looking  pretty good moving on over of course we had to   do sausage it's one of my all-time favorites it's  not the beyond meat version this is the real deal   and again we've got the classic marinara we've  got the cheese and of course the garlic wash in   the very back let's pan on over and check out  the five breadsticks that we've got here now   i opted to go for cheese sticks which you can do  in this case it actually upped it by a dollar for   the overall price but as you can see we've got  five glorious cheese sticks here dusted with a   little bit of that parmesan goodness on the very  top and you can really smell it pretty nicely   for dipping of course you've got classic marinara  to go with but guys take a look at dessert we've   got 10 cinnabon mini rolls and they're looking  pretty tasty i had a lot of fun reviewing these   the first time around but very very nice loaded  with cinnamon and obviously a nice amount of   icing on the very top there and looking very  classic like cinnabon usually does so let's   sample a little of this goodness considering  i just unwrapped this whole box in my car guys   let's do it it's the triple treat box here at  pizza hut let's peep out this flavor well as you   can tell by the thumbnail to this review this is  exactly how i have it set up in my car here right   now guys i have pretty much everything perched up  on boxes and i gotta admit it looks pretty crazy   to do this in my car by myself i'm getting a few  looks of people walking by me here right now but   you know what it's all good i'm eating my feelings  right now it's the holiday season okay so before i   get into this because i'm literally feeling like  i'm being pushed off to the side here right now   in my own car with all this food right over  here and like always if you guys are fans of   high quality delicious looking food reviews make  sure to hit that subscribe button down below and   don't forget to tap that bell icon so you can  be notified as soon as brand new content drops   every week all right guys let's start off with  the obvious i'm gonna go for a pepperoni slice   here and i gotta admit i'm really looking forward  to it even though pepperoni is not my favorite   here at all i do like it it's okay but obviously  sausage i'm definitely looking forward to getting   into but take a look at that up close there you  can really see the nice seasoning on there and   the crispiness of this pepperonis looks pretty  awesome let's give this a quick shot real fast oh yeah classic pizza hut this almost feels  like a thin crust pizza considering how thin   the crust actually is on this one here guys but  it's not it's got a little bit of doughiness to   it which is nice but the crispiness of those  pepperonis again a very lovely situation and   obviously the very back with the crust of course  i'm going to take a bite of this here real fast   i'm really digging the amount of seasoning this  has got as well so not bad for the overall value   of what i'm getting here right now considering  this is just the first slice of one of these   one topping pizzas you get two of them which is  pretty cool let's go for another bite real quick not bad i wish it was just a little  bit crunchier crust on the bottom   is a little on the light side in terms of  toastiness but it's good and again it's classic   pizza hut even though it's not the pan style which  really is the ultimate classic pizza hut because   that's what they're known for but still pretty  good on this let's go for a quick slice of the   sausage and again a very lovely situation with  the amount of sausage on there you can see all   the nice spicing you get the individual seeds that  you can see on some of those sausage pieces there   you know honestly it kind of looks like beyond  me but i know it's not but still pretty tasty on   this one and again fairly thin let's give this  one a shot here sausage pizza here pizza hut it's tasty the spicing is exactly like  the beyond meat for what they're using so   quality is good but this is the real deal  but still very tasty guys still very tasty   again the nice thinness of the crust itself  it's not pan like i mentioned but even still   not bad let me try and give you a look at the  very back here obviously it rises a little bit   more in the back the crust itself is looking  pretty toasty but again this one looks a little   bit more toasted compared to the other one it  still feels just a little soft though so let's   go for a quick bite of the crust in the back then  we'll move on to some of the fun stuff hang on it's actually a little bit toastier this side  feels like it's been cooked a little bit more   too so a little bit of an uneven job slightly but  not just because sausage is one of my favorite   toppings i mean it is but i'm really glad this  is really good right now because i'm hungry for   it and it's tasty all right so this definitely  satisfied my itch for some pizza right now and   there's a really fun sampling at least a couple of  those slices let's go in for a breadstick though   and again we've got some more toasty goodness here  and these are pretty sizable i have to admit not   bad whatsoever here take a look at the cheese on  that guys again it's got that nice italian dusting   some parmesan goodness and a little bit of that  cheese and if you're a fan like me i definitely   dig a little bit of burnt cheese the burnt ends  on the crust that the way it kind of caramelizes   up right there looking pretty good here right  now let's give the bread stick a shot real quick more tender loving care to make these than the  pizza believe it or not at least in the crust   department yeah it's good it's got a little bit  more of a buttery type of bottom which i really   like there that looks really really nice and again  you've got all the nice cheesy goodness to go with   this is worth a dollar upgrade if you decide to  do this guys obviously the regular breadsticks are   what they are but a little bit of cheese for a dollar  you definitely want to do that and obviously with   the marinara sauce that it comes with here let's  just go for a dip in this real fast somewhat thick   this is the pizza sauce obviously that they  use on their pizzas let's give this a shot yeah it's good i would have preferred ranch like i  usually do but tasty it's got some light sweetness   some tang to it as well and of course that nice  tomatoey flavor classic goodness right over there   as i'm dropping a little bit of pizza here believe  it or not let's just get into a little further   guys not bad for what this is as well but again a  nice throwaway to throw into this box to go with   the pizza naturally pretty tasty and i'm only  saying throw away because obviously it's a way   to fill the box outside of what they're offering  here in general besides the pizza and dessert so   a nice little add-on i should say to go with here  so with that let's get into a little dessert and   go for a cinnabon mini roll and there it is and  actually these kind of look like the centers of   the cinnabons themselves there when you get to  that gooey middle that's really a lovely situation   and that's really the best way to actually  have these so the mini version is the way to go   you don't really have to feel too bad about eating  more than one or two or three or five of these at   one time but as you can see by the very bottom  lots of cinnamon goodness swirled throughout   and of course we've got that icing action  to go with right there very lovely situation   let's give this a go because it really does  smell like classic cinnabon let's do it doughy sweet cinnamon goodness so good yeah i  definitely had a lot of fun checking these out   the first time around and if you want a little  bit more detail on these bad boys take a look at   my official review popping up on your screen here  right now it was a lot of fun to put together how   could you not love some doughy gooey cinnamon  goodness right with plenty of icing on the   top these are actually pretty good and as you  can see it's got all of that a fairly decent   amount of cinnamon on the inside here guys and  i have to admit with the icing kind of melting   down into the middle these are nice little  bite-sized nuggets of good sides and honestly   they really do feel like i said the very center  of the cinnabon pretty tasty guys pretty tasty all right so after a little bit of cleanup scratch  that a lot of cleanup everything is packed up on   the side over here i don't really feel so boxed in  off to the side but speaking of boxes guys again   a very cool option from pizza hut actually for  the holidays my very first time doing one of   these dinner deals actually personally here on  the channel i'm glad that i did this right now   i've never done anything with like bread sticks  like a dessert to go with so this was a lot of fun   but if for some reason what you're seeing right  now is not to your liking you can customize   the pizza options naturally you've got the two  medium one-topping pieces that i did right now   but you can also do a medium one-topping pizza and  a specialty pizza or just two specialty pizzas and   of course all the breadstick stuff the cinnabon  goodness all that stuff is gonna be the same but   you have the option to at least customize  the pizzas which is cool but again the very   cool packaging and as i'm probably being blocked  off sound wise as you can see very very slick so   i may even save this box because this is actually  pretty cool right now i'm a nerd like that what   can i say well what i can say is i'm going to  be reviewing this based upon the value of what   i got today so overall for $22.99 i'm gonna have  to give the triple treat box here with pizza hut   A.K.A. the quadruple box as far as i'm concerned are  pretty rock solid 9 out of 10 considering two   medium one topping pizzas is like 16 bucks on its  own over here that's not bad for about five more   dollars five or six more dollars if you get the  cheese on the bread sticks not a bad deal and you   do get the name brand cinnabon rolls to go with  and that's really is what kind of enticed me to   give this a go because it's been a minute since  i've had those so personally for me i think the   value is pretty decent for what you're getting and  the fact that it also comes custom gift wrapped on   the inside of this box is a pretty cool thing if  you ask me i'm definitely digging the marketing   and it really does fit the holiday because guys  come on it's the holidays after all you really   want to dress up your products right they're doing  it pretty well okay now the obvious question is   do you personally think this one was done pretty  well right now do you think it's a pretty banging   value for what i just reviewed overall in terms  of price point drop some comments down below let   me know what your personal thoughts are on this  particular one and also if cinnabon mini rolls are   definitely the jam for you because they are for  me drop those comments down below and definitely   let me know and with that this is Ian K closing  out another high quality foodie feature
