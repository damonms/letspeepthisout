 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty hey everyone it's ian K back again with another high quality foodie feature for you here on peep this out reviews this time returning on over to mcdonald's because they finally have something on the menu that i've never been able to try until right now filming this review feast your eyes on the hot and spicy mcchicken or in this case the 2 for $3.50 and as you already know by the title to this review i think you know what we're gonna do with it so let's start off with exactly what the hot and spicy mcchicken is it's a value-sized bun as you can see here and underneath it you've got a little bit of chopped lettuce a little bit of mayo and then obviously we've got that chicken patty that's kicked up with a little bit of heat looking nice and crispy with a little tinge of red nothing too threatening but absolutely different from the regular mcchicken underneath that there is nothing there so it's all going to be about how much spice is actually in this on top of that classic flavor that the mcchicken has but we're definitely not going to do just the normal version of this one we're going to do it the way i like to do it in this case we're going to double it up and i got to say that extra meat patty really makes a difference in terms of the presentation and of course the overall protein on the inside and this actually looks like it's worth the $3.50 asking price for that 2 for $3.50 not bad so let's see if the flavor and the heat is going to deliver on this one it's the double hot and spicy mcchicken here at mcdonald's let's peep out this flavor so yeah i've always wanted to try this hot and spicy mcchicken and i always said to myself if this ever becomes available in my area i absolutely want to double up on it and do it like i usually do my mcchickens which is of course the two patties in one and i gotta say guys it really does make the difference right there take a look at that it really goes a long way to adding a little bit more meat to this one and considering one of these goes for $2.89 for a few cents more you're actually getting a much more substantial sandwich and i got to admit i'm digging the way this looks already alright so before i take the first bite to hopefully confirm some decent heat as well as the flavor on this one and like always if you guys are fans of high quality

can't believe this finally it's the double hot and spicy mcchicken here at mcdonald's let's do it mmm thick all right there we go with a little bit of the sizzle but truth be told because i've got the extra patty on this right now it's a little bit more of a peppery type of heat that i'm getting it's a little bit more elevated than i think it would be normally with just a single patty so it's not crazy crazy strong but it is different from the regular mcchicken so it satisfies for that because it's got a little bit of heat but with the extra patty as you guys can see it's definitely got some thickness and with that thickness comes a little bit of that extra heat there so a little bit more of a peppery type of heat that i'm getting with this and the overall flavor of the mcchicken is exactly the same the chopped lettuce obviously a little bit of the light mayo action and naturally with a little bit more of the protein this really is the preferred way to eat it as far as i'm concerned the crispy coating is pretty solid and overall this works pretty well but just so you know as with all my reviews i have to review it as is so naturally even though mayo is not really my thing believe it or not what i usually get on my double mcchickens is ranch so imagine a double version of this with a little bit of ranch thrown into the mix you know that's going to be a lovely situation because for me ranch is primo with fried chicken and i absolutely love it so naturally when you're having the crispy goodness of something that this offers here with a little bit of heat on top of it with a little bit of the coolness of the ranch a lovely situation but for you guys right now i have to review it as is so when you get two of these take the patty put it in there if you guys are down with mayo you're gonna like it that much more but obviously the quality is pretty decent for the mcchicken in general it's essentially a big chicken nugget that's really pretty much all that it is but the value of what it offers and the tastiness that it gives you is pretty solid and the fact that you're having a little bit of extra heat on top of it that's not too bad either just expect it to be peppery heat it's not really like chili is there anything that i'm really tasting like that it's just a little bit of an elevated pepper type of situation but not bad let's keep going yeah i knew i was gonna like this because it's the mcchicken guys and as you can tell already on the inside about halfway in with a couple of bites here it is a pretty decent situation in terms of what you're getting and like i said the quality for $3.50 not too bad it's a value chicken sandwich naturally with a little bit of heat the peppery kind but i'm really digging the overall presentation of the crispiness the overall feeling of it and naturally the heat is a nice little add-on touch yeah definitely a pretty tasty value chicken sandwich really but do yourself a favor and like i said at the top of this review $2.89 for a single is not the way to go with this you really want to spend the extra few cents and go for that second one if you're gonna have them on their own that's cool but double it up it's absolutely fun to do and then add your favorite dipping sauce of choice from the nuggets that really is a nice combination all right so let's go for one more bite on this one before we wrap this one up after the rating but guys very very tasty i'm glad to have finally given this one a shot thankfully it's on the menu hopefully not for just a limited time only this really should be a permanent option but let's just see what happens pretty good all right let's do a little 360 of the double i pretty much said all i possibly can with this here guys you know what to expect the value is high 2 for $3.50 is solid and what you're getting here is very familiar it's very popular item on the mcdonald's menu and for good reason not bad for what this is and obviously with a sauce of choice to go with it outside of mayo you've got a lot to look forward to so with that said i'm gonna have to give the double hot and spicy mcchicken here at mcdonald's a pretty decent 8 out of 10 like i said the value is pretty high and technically at $1.75 a piece when you get it with that 2 for $3.50 it's not a bad value for what you're getting maybe just a little bit more elevated here on the west coast anyway but the size is okay and when you add that second patty and like i said your sauce of choice in my case it would be ranch to add to that absolutely you've got a pretty tasty chicken sandwich that's less than the average four to five dollar price point that's not bad either pretty solid okay so now i gotta ask you did this version of the hot and spicy mcchicken do it for you right now drop some comments down below have you ever doubled up on the mcchickens in general do you usually switch the sauces out do you simply add something different to it to make it a little bit different drop those comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K closing out another high quality foodie feature for you here on peep this out reviews bringing you
