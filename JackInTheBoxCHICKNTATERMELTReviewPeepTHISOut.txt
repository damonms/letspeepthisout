 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty hey everyone welcome back to another high  quality foodie feature here on the channel   this time i'm back on over at jack in the box  to go in on something that's normally part of   a late night promo for a discounted price with a  few other things but still available during the   day should you wish to get it and get it i most  definitely did take a look at the chicken tater   melt here at jack in the box and already i'm a  little underwhelmed by the size of this one guys   it's a little on the small side but that croissant  bun does look pretty cool alright let's pop it   underneath and see what we've got here it looks  like we've got an okay amount of bacon here not   exactly the leanest type of bacon it's a little on  the fatty side and the ranch that it's supposed to   have here as well is not as plentiful either just  a little dollop if that but the hash brown does   look nice and crispy so i'm definitely digging  that so far but being that it's actually stuck   to the chicken patty on the bottom separated with  cheese let me flip this one on over here so we can   take a look at that chicken patty and as expected  it's a little on the value side but it does seem   to be cooked pretty nicely guys not too bad and  like i mentioned earlier it is separated with some   gooey white cheese so naturally that's going to  add a little bit of creaminess i'm hoping to this   one here so let's not waste any more time on this  one this is the chicken tater melt here at jack   in the box let's peep out this flavor yeah this is  definitely something i've always wanted to come on   back to try and whenever i do all the other promo  items here at jack in the box i always see this   one staring at me in the menu and i've always said  to myself i'm gonna come back and give this one a   shot at some point now being that you can actually  get this at night which is what they'd recommend   you do this is actually part of jack's munchie  meals which are promo items that you can get   after 9 pm at night until 5am in the morning that  include an entree two tacos halfsey fries which is   essentially half curly fries and regular fries  and a drink and it's a discounted price point so   it's pretty cool just for that but like i said you  can also get this one during the day now granted   the price point's not going to be anywhere near  worth it being four dollars for this and normally   six dollars after hours it is what it is this is  actually not exactly the best value right now but   i was just curious to try the sandwich itself and  that's what we're definitely gonna get into but   before we do and like always if you guys are fans  of high quality delicious looking food reviews   make sure to hit that subscribe button down below  and don't forget to tap that bell icon so you can   be notified as soon as brand new content drops  every week guys here we go let me give you another   look at it here take a look at it the chicken  tater melt and i'm really hoping this actually   had an egg on it to be honest with the hash brown  with the cheese it would have been a nice combo   with the bacon kind of like a breakfast sandwich  but it actually kind of feels like one it's nice   and greasy actually in my hands here the butter  from the croissant is pretty heavy but let's   give this one a shot it's the chicken tater melt  solo dolo over here jack in the box let's do it flavorful that's actually not bad   right off the break that buttery croissant  is lighting this one up already guys it's   really setting the tone because the quality is  pretty decent and it really is not greasy like   i thought it was going to be it's more buttery  and that's a good thing all the other flavors   so far a little bit more of the hickory smoked  bacon which is a little on the fatty side but   the quality is okay on it not very crispy but  then you get into the hash brown a little bit   of that chicken solid guys but i'm not really  tasting any ranch or any cheese unfortunately so   take a look at this on the inside before we go for  another bite but as you can see it's okay for what   it is but at four bucks i don't really necessarily  think it's worth it naturally you really want to   do the regular jacks munchie meal of course and  go for that promo but for what this is so far   it's okay but it's really the croissant that's  really lighting this one up let's keep going in i got a nice chunk of the chicken with that second  bite and it's actually a huge chicken nugget which   is not bad guys the quality is decent and it is  actually kind of packed even though it's a little   on the small side for the value portion that  you have here but everything else on this one   i am not tasting i'm not tasting any cheese or any  ranch at all it's really just the chicken the hash   brown and that buttery croissant with the bacon  so i'd expect a little bit of tang from ranch and   at least something with the cheese maybe it's just  the glue to hold it together like i always say but   still guys not bad in terms of the flavor what you  get with this one well i'm glad i'm checking this   one out right now because like i mentioned every  time i come to jack in the box for all the reviews   i've done over the years i've always seen this  one on the menu and i always said i'm definitely   coming back to give this one a shot at some point  and today is obviously the day because you're   watching this review and i'm glad that i did  because the highlight is easily the croissant bun   on this here i can't remember the last time i had  something like this from jack but obviously with   the breakfast sandwich style that this is this  really needs an egg to really light that up even   further because the butteriness of the croissant  is pretty awesome i just wish the bacon was a   little bit more crispier and there's a little bit  of ranch to kind of offset a little bit of the   flavor that i have here because naturally ranch  is what they highlight on top of the gooey cheese   that they say but i'm not really getting any of  those flavors but guys still super delicious on   this one and the decent thickness juiciness and of  course the crispiness of that value chicken patty   is only enhancing the flavor that much further  on top of the butteriness of the croissants so   guys one more bite we'll finish this one up after  the rating but super glad to have given this one   a shot for you guys and i think you've known that  because i'm talking about it like crazy throughout   this review i'm glad to be doing this right now  because it's decent one more bite alright so   let's do 360 on this one as this croissant bun is  a little destroyed here right now but guys it's   super buttery and that really is the gluttonous  factor of it here i'm really digging that overall   the crispiness of the chicken is solid the bacon  is okay i wish it was a little bit leaner a   little bit more crispier but at the same time the  hashbrown is adding a nice dimension to this one   i just wish i could taste the ranch and the cheese  and again i really wish this one had an egg on   it that would have been amazing order on ubereats  postmates and grubhub well if you want to go back   in time and take a look at a full-fledged jack's  munchie meal review take a look at that one popping   up on your screen here right now that was the one  that i've got on here that i did way back in the   day when i was starting my channel out there and  it was the grilled cheese goodness that you're   gonna see in that one and it'll give you a good  idea of what all those other items that you have   to look forward to come with on this meal should  you decide to give one of those meals a shot   but guys as it stands this was a lot of fun to  check out like i said throughout this review and   i'm glad to finally scratch this one off the food  review bucket list here at jack in the box i only   wish like i said that it had an egg on it that  would have been just a primo thing to add overall   because it really does feel like a breakfast  sandwich but still as it stands very tasty so with   that said i'm gonna have to give the chicken tater  melt part of jack's munchie meals normally here at   jack in the box a pretty okay 7.5 out  of 10 would i get this one again definitely after   hours because like i said four bucks on its  own right now it's not necessarily worth that   but six bucks with everything else later easy  recommendation between 9 pm and 5 am every single   night that's the time to really get this one but  still very tasty for what it is and again that   buttery croissant very primo very primo indeed
