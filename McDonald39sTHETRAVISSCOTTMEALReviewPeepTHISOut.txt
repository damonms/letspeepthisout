mcdonald's featuring a medium sprite with extra ice a medium fries with a side of tangy barbecue sauce and the main star of the show outside of who it's fashioned after a special version of the quarter pounder with cheese let's take a look under this one here starting off with the sesame seed bun underneath it looks like all the usual goodies here we've got ketchup mustard slivered onions we have pickles and obviously you're noticing it already bacon applewood smoked bacon along with shredded lettuce all on top of a quarter pound of fresh beef along with that cheesy goodness as well guys looking really really tasty so let's not waste any more time with this one let's sample some of this goodness it's the all new travis scott meal here at mcdonald's let's peep out this flavor alright so after a few direct messages and actually a mention on one of my most recent live streams i decided to cave in and give this one a shot here and i figured the reason i'd probably want to do this is to try the quarter pounder with cheese with bacon because i've actually never done that and considering how tasty this looks i gotta admit i think i made the right decision by doing this here right now guys looking really really nice at 100% beefy goodness along with the lettuce along with the pickles and all the other stuff that it's got here but the applewood smoked bacon is gonna be the wild card with this one and i'm thinking it's gonna be pretty good i mean if it's good enough for travis scott how bad could this really be right okay so real quick before i take the first bite of this one

a shot i'm glad i'm doing this for you right now let's see how amazing this is it's the quarter pounder with cheese with bacon with lettuce a.k.a the travis scott sandwich as it's known let's do it it's a quarter pounder it's juicy and of course it's got all that amazing flavor with the cheesy goodness on top of the applewood smoked bacon so i'm seeing why this is a favorite already here guys and i got to admit this is really really tasty here nice juicy fresh beef you can't beat that along with the cheesy goodness and then the apple would smoke bacon the lettuce is a little bit of a throwaway on this one here it's okay for a little bit of extra crunch on top of the onions and the pickles i guess but this really is just a pretty tasty quarter pounder with cheese with bacon as it's advertised really this is actually pretty good yeah pretty tasty along with being pretty much what i expected actually here so let's go for a quick sip of that sprite with extra ice real fast being that it's about 106 degrees right now here in southern cali it's pretty crazy and as i'm getting myself set up to try some of the fries with that tangy barbecue action here right now just so you guys know and i mentioned at the top of the review they haven't done a themed type of promo like this here at mcdonald's in close to 30 years and believe it or not i believe it was with michael jordan back in the day i think it was the mcjordan something like that if you guys remember that burger if you remember the promo drop some comments down below and let me know what actually was on that burger to call it the mcjordan what was so special about it here let's give this a shot here with this tangy action barbecue sauce travis scott style let's give it a go as expected the awesome fries here at mcdonald's their iconic flavor you really can't replicate it anywhere else as far as i'm concerned with that nice tangy tartness that i'm getting from the barbecue sauce here lovely situation of course it's tasty as you'd expect it to be so yeah i'm digging that it's a very cool combo i can honestly see why this would be a favorite of him and i'm sure a lot of other people as well and that sprite actually does go very well with it as on top of it but as far as i'm concerned the main star of the show outside of the namesake of who we're dealing with here let me pull some of this bread off is this guy and i'm really glad to have given this a go here guys a very very nice combination of the beefy goodness over here at mcdonald's it's kind of an odd shape for that quarter pound patty right there as you can see but the bacon is really really nice on this the smoky flavor i can see why it's a regular on the menu now really really solid for what this is and again the throw away with that lettuce maybe to add a little bit of healthy aspect to it there i suppose but it's tasty it's what you'd expect it to be over here and again a very cool fun marketing promo to go with somebody who's pretty iconic in the game right now pretty pretty cool and hey you know it's also pretty cool this is actually only six bucks right now for about a month so that's actually not a bad deal considering the sandwich itself is usually in that range anyway you're getting the fries you're getting the drink pretty cool promo easy recommendation just for that aspect alone so as for the rating i think i'm gonna base this one strictly on the quarter pounder with cheese with bacon because it's my first time giving it a go and in that regard i'm gonna have to give it a really rock solid 9 out of 10 beautiful flavor on this one guys it's the iconic mcdonald's flavor with applewood smoked goodness thrown into the mix juicy because it's made fresh to order now i love that they switched over to that about a year ago or so really really solid it really does something for the quality of it and overall with the cheesy goodness the iconic flavor and naturally with everything else including the sprite with extra ice and considering how crazy hot it is right now this is already making me feel like i've got a lot of drink in here even though it's got a lot of ice it's all melted practically so it is what it is but guys really really solid definitely something to check out okay now the all-important question price point not withstanding because six bucks is a good deal would you actually get this regardless drop some comments down below is this one of your go-to's over here at mcdonald's even before travis scott announced it as his favorite meal over here at mickey d's
