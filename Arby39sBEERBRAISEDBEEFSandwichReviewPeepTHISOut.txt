wanted me to go in on their new beer braised beef sandwich as well so we're doing just that and here it is the beer braised beef sandwich from Arby's looking crazy fantastic right now guys I'm really diggin the amount of meat on the inside of this one it's looking really really great definitely diggin how the overall presentation is the way that this looks here especially with the pretzel roll in effect for you starting off on the very top here nice and soft it definitely feels very authentic let's take a look on the inside of course this is Arby's we've got the crispy onions we've got a mixture of pub mustard and beer cheese in this and as you guys can see that shredded beef goodness looks like it's been marinated in like a gravy broth of some type I don't maybe a combination of the two it's very wet and it looks very distinct and as you guys can see there is plenty of it in here guys looking really really nice the very bottom looks like it's got more of that action in there with the pub cheese and the mustard just a lovely situation overall guys and looking really really awesome so let's not waste any more time on this one let's see if the flavor's gonna deliver on it this is the all-new beer braised beef sandwich here at Arby's as part of meatoberfest let's peep out this flavor man the smell is pretty glorious on this guys and looks like it's got about maybe a quarter pound of beef on the inside of this it really feels very hefty and it's an Arby's sandwich of course it's gonna feel hefty right can't wait to get into this but as always before I take the first bite

do no wrong the light saltiness of that creamy type of braised beef is really jumping out of me right now it's very very rich and it really does feel like it was marinating in like a thick type of beef gravy it's distinctly different and I got to say guys absolutely delicious of course it goes amazing with the pretzel bun itself and when you mix in the even richer flavor coming from that beer cheese and the pub mustard combo that's a a beautiful situation let's keep going with this one and we'll give you that close-up it's really really good mmm absolutely beefy and absolutely flavorful it really is set off beautifully with this pretzel bun and the fact that the pretzel bun itself has a nice boiled yet baked flavor to it it really feels authentic goes a long way to really solidifying this one to being really up there with one of the best sandwiches I think Arby's has put out the braised beef is amazing it's just ultra rich and it really stood out beautifully on that beer cheese triple stack that I reviewed recently which you guys can take a look at popping up on your screen right now just a beautiful combination of Arby's goodness on the inside of a soft pretzel roll and again I'm really diggin the fact that the flavor of the braised beef is so distinctly different from the other meats Arby's has on the menu and I'm telling you I really do feel like this was marinated in some type of beef gravy or a broth of some type because it is so strong and so distinct and I can't really say it any better than that it's just noticeably different but flavorful guys super flavorful and super awesome but as awesome as this is you know we gotta light this one up with my favorite condiment right and I think you all know what's coming horsey sauce let's do it I think we'll go for this bite right here in the middle what do you guys think let's light it up very nicely yeah I do love me some horsey sauce and I venture to guess most of you guys who frequent Arby's do as well let's do it mmm insane flavor insane flavor horsey sauce is absolutely engineered to be amazing with meat guys and this is no exception the really really awesome flavor I'm getting from the braised beef with that brothy type of rich flavor is dovetailing so beautifully with the creaminess and the light bite from the horsey sauce just a beautiful combination and it lights up your taste buds it really is pretty amazing mmm you know nothing against that beer cheese triple stack but the flavor of this braised beef is standing out far and above and beyond anything else on that sandwich and that was a pretty amazing sandwich to check out as well but you can really taste the quality of the braised beef action that Arby's has got going on over here right now this is a beautiful showcase of that and while it was fun to check out three different meats all in one sandwich as always at Arby's the braised beef I think is definitely gonna edge it out in overall flavor even if it's just a little bit smaller but guys what you're getting is still a lot of meat amazing situation with this one one more bite and then we'll wrap this one up after the next close-up mmm well again I'm super thankful to Arby's for supplying the sandwich diaper for this one because these beer cheese sandwiches absolutely need them badly there is so much falling out the back of them and that's not a bad thing because it gives you something to look forward to at the end but guys as you can see a lovely situation with this one an easy recommendation for anyone who's into meat period this is definitely something you want to check out here at Arby's as part of meatobfest just a super delicious sandwich that delivers big-time definitely give this one a go so let's just get right to it because personally for me after everything you've seen and heard right now I think the rating should be pretty obvious so let me just confirm it for you the beer-braised beef sandwich here at Arby's as part of meatoberfest is gonna get the obvious 10 out of 10 there is nothing wrong with this sandwich whatsoever if you like meat you're covered and if you're at Arby's you obviously do and if you
