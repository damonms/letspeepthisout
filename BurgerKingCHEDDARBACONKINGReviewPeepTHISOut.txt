hail the cheddar bacon king here at BK and already this is winning in that meat and cheese Department as expected guys this is looking pretty glorious right there in the middle it looks to be loaded for sure starting off with that sesame seed bun on top let's pop it and take a look underneath looks like we have got plenty of ketchup looks like we've got some mayo as well and hence the name bacon king plenty of bacon guys there is a lot of it here and this is all on top of a half pound of beef we've got two quarter-pound patties here with four slices of cheddar cheese I'm gonna try and split this for you here and see if we can look a little bit further in its very gooey very much stuck together but lots of cheese for sure and I'm definitely diggin the amount that is actually right there in the middle take a close gander at that that is pretty awesome underneath it take a look a little further looks like it is just the bottom of the bun so very simple build on this one but plenty of meat plenty of cheese hence the name bacon king plenty of bacon and I got to say this is gonna be pretty tasty I think let's see if it's gonna deliver in overall flavor I think I know what to expect it's the cheddar bacon king brand-new for the new year here at BK let's peep out this flavor yeah this is definitely a meat and cheese showcase as always with these king burgers here at bk and regardless of the theme in this case cheddar there's always gonna be plenty of cheese plenty of meat and it really does shine in that department guys there's just so much of it on here so before I confirm the flavor and obviously satisfy my curiosity as always if you guys are fans of high quality delicious looking food reviews make sure to hit that subscribe button down below and don't forget to tap the bell icon so you can be notified as soon as brand-new content drops every week here we go guys the cheddar bacon king let's do it Oh already thick beef a lot of cheese mmm that cheddar is actually really nice on this I'm with the bacon on top of it the hickory smoked goodness that that's delivering you're getting a lot of flavor initially up front along with the flame grilled goodness that BK is known for with their beef but man that is just a very packed bite and I gotta say a very thick one let's keep going guys this is actually pretty tasty we'll give you that close-up well we're definitely not reinventing the wheel with this one and when it comes to the bacon king there is no reason to it's a total meat and cheese showcase with plenty of bacon and what it does it does extremely well with the theme this month being cheddar I have to admit I do like the subtleness of it and I have to admit with four slices on here it really does stand out very nicely and that's over the ketchup and the mayo in general very basic build on this one but guys it's a meat and cheese showcase of epic proportions and it really does satisfy it very tasty yeah I think BK knows what it's doing when it comes to these king burgers they're absolutely catering to the meat and cheese crowd and I'm very glad to be part of that group guys because this really does satisfy every time I try one of them I am overwhelmed with the amount of meat the amount of cheese it's just very hearty and there's just a ton of bacon on this on top of it so the bacon King is obviously a flagship promo burger here and with the cheddar cheese added to it and everything else that it's got the light salt and pepper blend in between the meat which is tasty as well everything really blends together to give you a very flavorful burger and guys the cheddar cheese like I said it's subtle but there's a lot of it in here and you can really taste the difference along with that hickory smoked bacon definitely bomb let's go for one more bite and we'll wrap this one up I think you can tell I like this one right pretty awesome here we go so let's do a little 360 action because why not right guys feast your eyes once again as we go around here on the cheddar bacon King very lovely situation plenty of beef plenty of cheese there is a lot to like with this one and if you like cheddar like I mentioned at the top of this review this one is definitely gonna be for you plenty of bacon on top of it and just overall a meat and cheese showcase very delicious and you've got the appetite for one of these things I really don't think you need the fries but go for it if that's your thing this is actually really really good so let's just get right to it overall I'm gonna have to give the cheddar bacon King here at BK are pretty rock solid 8.5 out of 10 like I said earlier in this review it's not reinventing the wheel this is the same bacon king that you know and love if you've had it already but with that swap out to cheddar this time out let's just say the flavor profile is gonna be enhanced just a little bit and I have to admit with four slices on there how could it not be pretty awesome now of course the
