 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty hey everyone welcome back to another high quality  foodie feature for you here on the channel where   this time i'm over at the habit burger girl  to check out their latest promo and let's   just say if you're a fan of breakfast you've  got every reason to be excited about this one   so without further ado here we go with the brunch  charburger here at the habit and guys this looks   absolutely massive i am totally digging what  i've got in front of me here right now and   the aroma is screaming breakfast so let's  pop the top of this toasted brioche bun and   take a look underneath and as you can see one  of the main stars of the show feast your eyes   on that sunny side up egg i gotta say this  is looking really nice very yolky for sure   underneath that we've got a nice bed of hickory  smoked bacon and guys it's looking really crispy   already going further on down we've got a slice of  american cheese and that's all sitting on top of   their chargrilled beef patty caramelized edges  that's completely encased by that cheese slice   very very awesome and for good measure underneath  it we've got about six crispy tots and that's all   along with our house-made secret sauce on the very  bottom and i gotta say guys everything is looking   absolutely beautiful with this here right now  the smell like i said is screaming breakfast and   i cannot wait to get into this it looks awesome  here we go with the brunch charburger here at the   habit let's peep out this flavor yeah man glorious  isn't even the word for this right now take a look   at all of those awesome ingredients stacked  up high right now this is looking absolutely   beautiful and again guys the presentation is  crazy i have a feeling i'm gonna really like this   just because of the amount of yolk that's on  the bottom of the container here right now   you can really tell this is a freshly made egg  and it smells and looks awesome all right enough   talking let's get this one going it's the all new  brunch charburger here at the habit let's do it mmm that crispy bacon a little bit of the egg  that i got in that first bite is mixing so   beautifully with the sauce in the very bottom  of this guys it's kind of like a mix of like a   thousand island kind of like a ketchupy  type of sauce a little bit of sweetness   but man really really awesome take a look at that  on the inside guys that bacon you can see is so   crispy it is stacked up it is holding up that  egg on the very top there and the cheese on the   very bottom on the patty itself the hash brown  goodness very very delicious and of course it's   held together beautifully with this brioche bun  guys this is awesome already let's keep going in i just got to say it after that second bite this  is hands down my favorite burger over here at the   habit right now promo wise anyway because their  standard charburgers are awesome but guys all the   smokiness of the bacon the crispiness is so insane  with this and when you do get to the burger itself   the caramelized edges are mixing so beautifully  with everything else along with the hash browns   on the very bottom and i'm saying hashbrowns  because they all kind of congeal together   when you bite into this so it tastes like i'm  biting into one big piece of potato and a fried   lovely potato with that but guys loveliness all  around this is super delicious yeah i gotta say   i'm getting shades of the farmhouse king from way  back in the day over at bk i'll have that review   popping up on the screen right now so you can  take a look at that that was one of my all-time   favorite variations of the king burgers over there  but guys a sunny-side egg is amazing on a burger   in general just a nice yolk goodness that it adds  to the overall flavor really kind of heightens the   flavor i think of the chargrilled goodness on the  beef patty alone but all the other ingredients the   melty cheese everything you can taste and again  the very bottom of it guys they put six tots in   the bottom of this so you're guaranteed to get  a little bit of something in pretty much every   bite here and again the quality of everything  else is so delicious on this let's go for   a couple more bites guys but awesome awesome  awesome three times the fun let's keep doing it so much bacon i swear it's like they took a whole  handful of bacon i just plopped it on this burger   with everything else on here and again the egg and  the bacon combination with the cheese is just a   beautiful situation guys i can't stop talking  about this one because it is so delicious so   yeah i think it's pretty obvious what the score is  going to be for this guys but i got to say again   i'm so glad to have checked this one out right  now because with me not being a breakfast person   i mean i do like breakfast occasionally early in  the morning if i can get up to get it but with   this you can do it all day long because literally  it's breakfast and lunch together on a bun guys so   super super delicious and like i said worth your  time if you're a breakfast person you're gonna   love all the flavors because they're so strong in  the breakfast department especially with the egg   and the bacon and the cheese together loveliness  all around all right so let's go for one more bite   in this one we'll close it up after the rating but  guys a beautiful situation over here to check this   one out and i gotta say again loveliness  all around one last bite let's go for it yesir this almost feels like a very  upscale farmhouse king from back in   the day and that was one of my all-time  favorites like i was saying earlier but   as we go around the world with  this one here you're gonna see   breakfast goodness all around guys you gotta  love the tots in the bottom that secret sauce   which is a combination of kind of like a thousand  and ketchup but i gotta say it adds the right   amount of sweetness not too much to overpower  the other flavors but this is a breakfast   burger through and through on serious steroids  really really awesome over here at the habit   yesir definitely some delicious stuff and easily  one of the best promo burgers i've tried over here   at the habit yet just the combination  of breakfast and lunch together on that   shines through like you wouldn't believe and  obviously as you've seen with all the footage   in this review it is loaded up to the gills with  flavor because of what's on it truly awesome stuff   so just to confirm the obvious for you i'm gonna  have to give the brunch char burger here at the   habit burger grill an easy 10 out of 10 guys  there is nothing wrong with this burger whatsoever   just the perfect amount of toastiness on the  bottom with those crispy tots and like i said   when you bite into it everything congeals together  it's like you're going into a big large hash brown   along with that sauce on the bottom a very  nice combination of flavor right there but   guys the egg the bacon the cheese the  chargrilled goodness from the charburger itself   a lovely combination all encased in a beautiful  lightly toasted brioche bun banging all around   truly alright so i gotta ask like always  especially considering how drool-worthy   this burger is right now are you gonna be giving  this one a shot drop some comments down below   let me know if you're going to give this one a  go over here at the habit and how much are you   a fan of eggs on burgers in general drop those  comments down below and definitely let me know   and with that this is Ian K closing out another  high quality foodie feature for you here on   peep this out reviews bringing you brand new  content every
