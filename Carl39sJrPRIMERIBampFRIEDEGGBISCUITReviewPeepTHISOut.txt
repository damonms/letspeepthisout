 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty all right everyone let's get it it's Ian K back again with another high quality foodie feature for you here on peep this out reviews returning to carl's jr once again because after checking out their prime rib and cheddar angus thickburger the other day i noticed they're also offering that same prime rib in a couple of breakfast items so let's take a look at one of them guys feast your eyes on the prime rib and fried egg biscuit and this is already looking glorious with that made from scratch biscuit action right there looking really nice and buttery especially on top let's take a look underneath it looks like we've got a fried egg a very nice sized fried egg i might add there and underneath that of course we've got the star of the show that sliced prime rib and it looks very very tasty guys really really nice that's actually sitting on a slice of swiss cheese and that's keeping it all together so it's looking really really great let's not waste any more time on this one guys let's get into it it's the prime rib and fried egg biscuit here at carl's jr let's peep out this flavor all right so as many of you know i'm definitely not a breakfast person at least a breakfast person early in the morning i mean i love breakfast don't get me wrong but getting up super early in the morning is not my thing i'm pretty much more of a brunch guy myself personally but when i saw that this prime rib was available for breakfast i definitely wanted to make sure i got over here to give this one a shot and guys i have to admit this looks really fantastic definitely a decent amount of that prime rib action on here and i gotta say that fried egg is really setting it off with that melted cheese so let's not waste any more time but of course first things first if you guys are fans of high quality delicious looking food reviews make sure to hit that subscribe button down below and don't forget to tap that bell icon so you can be notified as soon as brand new content drops every week guys the prime rib and fried egg biscuit let's do it mmm oh we got fried egg right away mmm and the swiss cheese and then the butteriness of that biscuit along with that prime rib that is a lovely situation guys but honestly this is beginning to kind of fall apart already but super flavorful so far let's go for another bite i'm going to take you in this guy this is pretty tasty you know you'd think the prime rib was going to be the star of the show with this one but it's really the fried egg and that swiss cheese and the butteriness of that made from scratch biscuit that combination is a lovely situation then of course the protein that you're getting here let me swing it around to show you nice cuts on this one guys it's got a nice oven baked type of flavor and it really comes up on the back end but it's not in the front what is in the front like i said is going to be the cheese the egg and that biscuit but this combo works this is really nice and hey honestly i like the fact that it's something other than the typical bacon and sausage that we usually see with these things so that's a nice touch right there and i gotta say guys like i said that combination really works that is so good the prime rib itself is not overly juicy but just to give you a look at one of the cuts here it is really nicely done and like i said that oven baked flavor that it's got is going amazingly well with the swiss cheese i think this actually works better than the cheddar supposedly on the other sandwich that swiss with prime rib is a nice combination but very very tasty and very tender but still what i'm liking even more on this is that fried egg and that swiss cheese and again with the butteriness of that made from scratch biscuit guys that is a lovely situation you got to be careful because it does fall apart but it is definitely freshly made you can tell and just overall nice quality really really nice and for a little over four bucks it's not a bad deal and what you're getting is a flavor packed breakfast sandwich and again without the usual bacon and sausage that we usually see pretty nice let's go for one more bite we'll finish this one up after the rating as always but guys very tasty i would highly recommend this one for you especially if you're a breakfast person and you can actually get up early in the morning to enjoy something like this not bad you know i gotta say i kind of wish carl's jr actually used a swiss cheese sauce on that prime rib and cheddar angus thickburger that i reviewed recently which if you haven't seen that review take a look at it popping up on your screen here right now actually any type of cheese on that would have been a bonus and you'll know why when you see that review but when it comes to this that prime rib and fried egg i got to say guys a beautiful situation the swiss cheese works amazingly well on it and the flavor is mild enough but it dovetails so beautifully in with the fried egg and that buttery made from scratch biscuit that combination is a lovely situation and like i said the prime rib itself a beautiful protein choice because it's something other than sausage other than bacon and it really has a beautiful flavor to it and i like that because even though it stands out at the very end aside from all the other flavors it works very well and you can't beat the price little over four bucks pretty good so with that said i'm gonna have to give the prime rib and fried egg biscuit here at carl's jr a rock solid 9 out of 10 if only this thing didn't really kind of fall apart when you're eating it that's really the only thing the problem with these biscuits is typically that but the flavor delivers across the board and it's very rich tasting so guys easy recommendation and like i said if you're a breakfast person you got something to look forward to which segues into this question i'm gonna ask you right now are you a breakfast person are you one of the types that likes to get up early to go for breakfast at some of these fast food spots and if you are are you excited to give this one a shot drop some comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K closing out another high quality foodie feature for you here on peep this out reviews bringing you brand new content every single week here
