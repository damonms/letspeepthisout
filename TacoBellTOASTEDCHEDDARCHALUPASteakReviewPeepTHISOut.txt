 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty Taco Bell unveils with what they're calling this year's biggest innovation as it takes their fan favorite chalupa into cheesy new territory and it looks like that cheesy new territory has been aged by six months guys feast your eyes on the toasted cheddar chalupa featuring six-month aged sharp cheddar toasted right into the shell and I have to admit this looks really really nice the textural look on the outside is looking nice and crispy and it looks really nice against that chalupa shell they're looking really cool I like how it sits in the naked chicken chalupa sleeve so it's gonna be easier to hold and not get your fingers too greasy let's take a look on the inside of this one as you can see all the usual Taco Bell goodies here we've got reduced fat sour cream lettuce cheese tomatoes then on the very bottom I decided to go with some steak just to switch it up a bit here but looking okay for what it is this is actually very similar to the regular chalupa supreme the only difference is instead of a three cheese blend you're just getting a little bit of shredded cheese here but for all intents and purposes this really is the toasted cheddar chalupa supreme in my eyes looking really cool let's see if the flavor is gonna deliver on this one it smells really really good this cheese is very strong on this one guys it's the toasted cheddar chalupa brand new here at Taco Bell let's peep out this flavor yeah definitely a very sharp smelling cheddar cheese on this one for sure guys very excited to get into this one but before I do and like always if you guys are fans of high quality delicious looking food interviews which i think many of you are hit that subscribe button down below and don't forget to tap the Bell icon so you could be notified as soon as new content drops every week here we go it's the toasted cheddar chalupa with steak here at Taco Bell mmm crunchy mm-hmm strong rich cheese flavor on that really nice I got to admit though while I am loving the toasted cheddar flavor of this one it's got a nice saltiness to it it's kind of clashing just a little bit with the actual chalupa shell itself I mean the chalupa on its own it's kind of like a little bit of a buttery type of flatbread like a pita but it's got its own thing going on with that but with this cheese added to it the sharpness of that aged cheddar is really going toe-to-toe with it but I have to admit it seems just a little bit overwhelming just a little bit to me at least but the flavor is decent everything on the inside of the actual chalupa is the same as I always know from the chalupa itself I mean I like it it's taste you don't get me wrong but it's just a little off to me but let's just keep going with it well it's definitely a smart move to have the sleeve with this one because it's a very oily type of outer coating obviously here guys so I'm glad that they actually have some protection for the fingers but on the inside again all the usual stuff from Taco Bell I decided to go with the steak like I mentioned because I am a fan of the steak here anyway and I thought the meat would be just a little bit more milder to really give me more of the flavor of this toasted shell on the outside to really see how the quality of it is instead of just the beef which I find just a little overwhelming sometimes but guys I like the toastiness of this one I like the overall flavor of the cheese itself but like I said I think it's just a little off in terms of what they have it on here because of the flavor of the actual chalupa shell itself being what it is of course that's just my humble opinion but on the real as tasty as the cheese is on this it really only makes me long to the idea of having like a newer version of the quesalupa that came out a few years back that was actually pretty amazing with the pepper jack cheese on the inside so you had a little bit of that cheese pull action and just seemed more full but this is kind of a step in the direction to give you something similar but a little bit easier for them to make a have a feeling but like the quality of it but like I said the execution is just a little off because of the combination of the sharpness of the cheese on this one and the shell itself but it's tasty though it's not bad so overall not bad in the execution because you do get a decent amount of that aged cheddar on the outside you can really see the textural difference it's really really nice one thing to note also with this is the chalupa shell itself does feel just a little bit thinner compared to the standard one so you're probably noticing that on the sides there but decent for what this is it's not something I don't think I would ever get again to be honest even in the beef form but only because the chalupa is not exactly my all-time favorite I know a lot of you guys love it but for this execution of it for this type of novelty it's okay for what it is yeah this one wasn't the banger I was hoping it was gonna be I mean naturally the sharp cheddar and the outside is the major highlight it's the major selling point and what they executed with that is very very good I mean the quality of that aged cheddar was really tasty I just think it would have been better suited on something maybe on the outside of a quesalupa type of shell and maybe a little cheese on the inside of that to really load it up but as it stands that's just wishful thinking and what I got here today it's just okay so with that said based upon my opinion of this one I'm gonna have to give the toasted cheddar chalupa the steak variant just an OK 7 out of 10 I really can't go much higher than that because naturally the quality overall was really great on the shell itself and everything on the inside was the familiar talked about flavor it's just that like you've heard me mentioned throughout this review something was just off between the flavor of the chalupa shell itself and that toasted cheddar it just didn't really feel like it was working for me but overall it's just all right now of course the obvious question is do you think this one looks all right drop those comments down below are you really excited to get what's supposed to be one of the biggest innovations ever a Taco Bell a try over here and if you are how excited are you to try it with the steak the beef or maybe even the chicken if you can get it that way I'm sure you can drop those comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K closing out another episode of peep
