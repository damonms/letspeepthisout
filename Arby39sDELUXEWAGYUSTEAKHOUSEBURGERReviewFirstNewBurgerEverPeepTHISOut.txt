 what's going on everyone and welcome or  welcome back to the channel it's Ian K   where today i'm over at arby's to check  out one of their all new burgers they've   got going on the menu for a limited time only  that's right you heard me correct burgers at   arby's it's a first right so stay tuned because  the deluxe wagyu steakhouse burger is up next   welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty wow you know i never thought i'd see the day  burgers at arby's but considering their main   slogan is we have the meats i guess this  is not too much of a stretch guys feast   your eyes on this one here the deluxe wagyu  steakhouse burger at arby's and i gotta say   this is looking really nice look at the size of  that patty in the middle this is looking pretty   awesome already let's break this one down real  fast yes sir the presentation's starting off   pretty nice already with a fairly sizable toasted  buttery brioche bun and once we pop it take a look   underneath guys plenty of what they're calling a  special burger sauce along with shredded lettuce   and as we pan down you're gonna see we've got  a couple of slices of tomato plenty more of that   special burger sauce and more of that shredded  lettuce underneath it guys is the main star of   the show the american wagyu ground beef  patty comprised of 52% wagyu beef and 48%   ground beef guys this is actually 6.4 ounces  before cooking and it's fairly sizable of   course we've got a slice of american cheese  on top of it you gotta have that of course   and underneath it it looks like we've got some  pickles and some red onion thrown into the mix   but guys all the standard features of what a  main cheeseburger should have but with that   higher quality type of beef guys this is really  looking pretty nice so let's not waste any more   time on this one this is the all new deluxe wagyu  steakhouse burger at arby's let's peep out this   flavor you know i think this one could have  benefited from a burger diaper guys there is so   much special burger sauce on this one from top to  bottom it is literally drenched in my hands right   now i can feel it through the bun it is that crazy  all right here we go finally let's give this one   a shot i'm very excited about this one it's the  deluxe wagyu steakhouse burger at arby's my first   time trying it first time trying a burger from  arby's period this is pretty banging here we go thick wow right off the break that is a very  thick lovely situation guys let me just show   this to you here because i am totally digging  the size of the meat here i mean 6.4 ounces   before cooking it looks like it didn't  lose too much in the cooking process at all   that is just loveliness all around along with that  special burger sauce the combination is beautiful   i wouldn't say it's like a mac sauce or a thousand  island but it has a little bit of a zip to it a   little bit of sweetness but overall guys very very  flavorful so far let's keep going in pretty nice whoa well right out the gate this is definitely  a rocket in terms of flavor and i think it   definitely has something to do with the quality  of the meat itself i mean wagyu is typically a   little bit of a fattier type of meat so there's  more flavor in general but when they make it   sous-vide in this case here which is french for  under vacuum you're basically sealing in all the   juices with this one here lower temperature  longer cooking and it really comes through in   the flavor of this one a beautiful combination of  all the other crunchy goodness with the pickles   but guys it is really really flavorful have i  said that enough already yeah this really is a   wagyu beef showcase naturally because that's the  main ingredient on this on top of that special   burger sauce guys like i said it's got a little  bit of a zip to it and i have to say it adds to   the overall compliment to everything else on here  naturally with the crunchiness of the pickles   and even the cheese which is kind of there but  it's more drowned out by the sauce but with the   softness of the bun on this one guys again the  size of the meat is just crazy this is really   really nice for a first effort i have to say they  definitely have the meats when it comes to burgers   they definitely have the burgers now too this is  pretty banging let's go for another couple on it yes sir a beautiful combination of wagyu beef  goodness with this one guys i mean considering 52%   of this stuff is comprised of that and then you  have 48% of ground beef the combination works very   nice and it's fairly juicy still the patty itself  is not so much wide as it is thick and that's fine   because the thickness is banging when you get into  this one and of course with all the other stuff   that this comes with here it's all the classic  stuff you'd expect to find on a nice cheeseburger   naturally along with the heartiness that you'd  expect overall as well and like i said right   out the gate this is a rocket in terms of flavor  all right so let's go for one more bite of this   one before we wrap the review up with the rating  coming up next but guys a very delicious first   outing for burgers over here at arby's and i have  to say the combination of wagyu and ground beef   is a winner truly something different and super  flavorful one more bite and we'll close it out hang on yes sir just a word of advice to all of you  guys make sure you've got plenty of napkins   on hand because like i said there is plenty of  that special burger sauce on this one but guys   it goes so beautiful with the wagyu action  i gotta say i am totally digging it along   with that ground beef it almost feels like  a double patty considering how thick it is   but it's very hearty and definitely worth your  time to check out this is really something to try   so with that said i'm going to have to give the  deluxe wagyu steakhouse burger here at arby's and   again i can't believe i'm saying that out loud  burgers at arby's that's just too awesome it's   going to get a rock solid 9 out of 10 guys really  nothing wrong with this whatsoever it was a flavor   showcase for sure with that special burger sauce  going immediately with everything else in that   the wagyu and the ground beef patty i got  to say the beautiful situation the cheese   a little non-existent because of the flavor of  that burger sauce but even still all the crunchy   goodness that it's got everything in general just  really sings on that one guys and it is very very   flavorful across the board easily worth your time  to check out i mean you're going to right come on   all right so do me a quick favor of course  drop those comments down below and let me   know if you're going to be giving this one  a go just to confirm that for me which i'd   venture to guess if you've made it this far into  the review you're probably going to but overall   what did you think
