 what's going on everyone welcome back to another  high quality foodie feature for you here on the   channel where this time i'm over at domino's to  check out a version of something that i haven't   tried in over seven plus years and considering  how tasty this is looking right now i'm beginning   to wonder why i waited so long so let's get into  this one feast your eyes on their stuffed cheesy   bread the bacon and jalapeno variant and i  gotta say this is looking awesome already   what you're looking at here is eight oven-baked  breadsticks stuffed with cheese smoked bacon and   jalapeno peppers that's also covered in a blend of  mozzarella and cheddar cheeses and not only that   it's also seasoned with a touch of garlic and  parmesan but guys the presentation is looking   killer on it and for dipping i decided to go in  with some garlic sauce to see if i can elevate   that even further and guys i think it's going to  garlic with all this goodness how could it not   so let's not waste any more time on this one it's  the stuffed cheesy bread with bacon and jalapeno   here at domino's let's peep out this flavor  well i gotta say this is already wedding in   the presentation department guys i mean oven-baked  bread with melted cheese and all the goodness to   go with and the smell of garlic in my car right  now with parmesan how bad could this really be   this looks really really good all right let  me break off a piece of this here and we'll   get it going wow this is very hot i'm doing this  on a very hot day as well i've got my little fan   off to the side wow cheesy goodness on this man  take a look at that guys lovely toasted action   on the very top mozzarella and cheddar cheese  goodness we've got some bacon and supposedly   some jalapeno in there i'm guessing it's kind of  chopped up but nice and doughy let's give this a   shot guys it's the stuffed cheesy bread bacon  and jalapeno variant of dominos let's do it toasty soft buttery even mmm wow yeah i don't  know why i waited so long guys the garlic and   the parmesan along with the butteriness  that i'm getting with the oils of the   cheese on top of it it's a lovely situation  and honestly i haven't really gotten to any   real jalapenos yet let me swing this around  the side here so you can take a look at it   there is a decent amount of cheese on the  very top and it is a very nice cheese stick   essentially here with a nice doughy action to  go with but i'm really digging this guys the   quality of the garlic and everything with this  is pretty banging let's keep going in pretty good   hmm there we go lots of bacon oh  yeah smoky flavor and some jalapeno   well just after that second bite I'm getting a  better look on the inside of this one and also   looking at some of the pieces on the side here  the stuffed aspect of this I'm thinking is pretty   much on top of the bread itself with the cheese  on the very top so technically it's stuffed but   not exactly inside the dough and i'll give you a  representation of that right here as you can see   front loaded on the very top and then you have the  nice chewiness on the very bottom right there guys   but i gotta say it's a decent amount of cheese  as you can see with the parmesan the notes of   garlic all that good stuff really digging the  quality and the smoke of the bacon is pretty   banging let's keep going in and then of course  we're gonna get into some garlic sauce hang on   mmm oh take a look at the jalapeno action right  there diced jalapenos very lovely situation and actually you know what let me lift this up  really quick here and i'll try and pull this   apart for you there we go some cheesy action there  is lots of goodness on this guys very very cheesy   for sure but again it's more front loaded on  the very top of this here look at that just an   awesome display of cheesy goodness for you this  is a pretty banging combination guys it really is   all right so you guys getting hungry yet because  the further i'm getting into this the more hungrier   that i'm getting so let's go in for a little bit  of the garlic sauce and see how this is gonna   pair up with it guys i can't wait to give this  one a shot let's get this open here really fast   decent really decent more buttery than anything  else so without further ado let's go for that dip   action on a nice big chunk of the cheese right  there take a look at that garlic action along   with the mozzarella the cheddar cheese goodness  the bacon jalapeno the butteriness the bread   everything to go with guys let's give it a shot  well right off the break with this garlic sauce   i gotta say this is really more of a butter sauce  there's light garlic to it it's not very heavy but   what i'm getting is a lot of the other ingredients  shining through on the stuffed cheesy bread itself   and i guess you really want that because this is  more of an accent but guys again what you're gonna   get is the nice toasty goodness of everything  that this has to offer based upon the flavor   that you choose and of course it's toasted bread  it's nice and buttery in on its own but when you   add that with the garlic sauce it just elevates it  that much more with a little bit of garlic flavor   guys just a little bit extra but overall guys  the combination works nicely let's keep going in oh yeah that buttery goodness along with  the smoked bacon is a very nice accent to   everything as well and then you're getting a  nice flavor from the pickled jalapeno action   as you can kind of see there as it begins to focus  in there's a little bit more chunkier pieces   in the middle but it's more dice than anything  else but as you can see with that bacon action   to go with and of course plenty of garlic the  buttery goodness with this guys this is a nice   very decadent type of side item to go with  anything that you get over here dominos or   just on its own like i'm doing right now pretty  awesome so yeah i'm really sorry i waited so long   to come back to give these stuff cheesy breads a  shot i think the very first one that i did was the   spinach and feta way back in the day and if i'm  not mistaken that was my very first domino's pizza   review here on the channel and it was actually a  side item not an actual pizza so you're probably   seeing that jumping up on your screen here  right now take a look at that it's a little   cringe-worthy i'm sure but it'll give you all  the detail on that particular one and while i'm   definitely glad to have started off with that one  guys this is actually a very nice one to come back   to over seven plus years later so let me give you  another look at it here three pieces all at one   time really digging the toastiness the oven baked  bread goodness here is such a lovely situation   indeed and as you can see plenty of cheese to go  around some of the caramelized edges along with   it as well this is just very very decadent and  of course with the smoked bacon and the chopped   jalapeno a very lovely combination especially with  that garlic dipping sauce aka the butter sauce   and just so you know i almost went in on ranch  sauce with this actually i think that combination   would have been pretty good as well the creamy  tang of ranch along with all those ingredients   along with the smoked bacon and the jalapeno but  when i saw garlic i'm like i gotta do it i'm sure   it's gonna be a butter type sauce and it was but  like i said more butter than garlic still very   tasty though so with that said i'm gonna have to  give the stuff cheesy bread the bacon and jalapeno   variant here at domino's a pretty awesome 9 out of  10 guys it was super delicious across the board   my only gripe with it however is that the toppings  believe it or not were a little uneven throughout   the bread itself there was more kind of like  under the top layer of cheese on top of the bread   so not necessarily stuffed but at the same time  very delicious and again with that garlic sauce   aka the butter sauce a beautiful combination even  still super delicious on its own or with anything   else that you would get over here at domino's  easy recommendation all right so as for the   questions outside of the usual if you're going to  give this one a shot or not do me a quick favor   drop some comments down below out
