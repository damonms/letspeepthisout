 hey everyone welcome back to another high quality  foodie feature for you here on the channel where   this time i'm headed into little caesars to check  out their latest hybrid pizza mash-up this time   apparently with a calzone that's right first  we had the slices 'n stix and now we've got   the crazy calzony so stay tuned because it's up  next welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K   stay frosty pizza pizza all right here we go  with the crazy calzony a.k.a the ninja throwing   star of fast food pizzas over here at little  caesars and as you can see we've got the cheese   variant and guys i gotta say the presentation  is pretty interesting on this i got to admit it   is absolutely different all right so to break  this one down for you what i've got here is a   large cheese pizza with a parmesan and butter  calzone-like crust that's actually filled with   garlic white sauce and even more cheese and guys i  gotta say the aroma of butter in my car right now   is pretty crazy on top of the parmesan gotta admit  this is looking pretty dynamite and it's smelling   pretty dynamite as well and as you guys can see  it's a fairly even mix of bread all around this   one here it looks like they pretty much split it  down the sides and then fold it over and what you   got here is literally the ninja throwing star of  fast food pizzas it really looks pretty cool and   it absolutely looks packed with cheese especially  in the middle section as you can see lots of gooey   action to be had right there so to round this one  out and to complete this promo we've got a side   of their famous crazy sauce so i can't wait to  go for a little dip action with all this bread   guys it really looks pretty awesome and obviously  they give you a very decent amount of it as well   so let's not waste any more time on this one  let's see if the cheese variant's gonna deliver   this is the all-new crazy calzony here at little  caesars let's peep out this flavor aaaah yes pizza   review time in the car during the summer time guys  this is blistering hot right now just minutes old   right out of the oven and honestly it is heating  up my car ridiculously on top of the crazy weather   outside i'm pretty much sweating all over the  place here this looks pretty fantastic and again   a ninja throwing star of pizzas for fast food  this really looks pretty crazy i gotta admit   i am really digging the overall presentation and  the way that it's cut as well is very interesting   so let me pull up a piece here wow this is very  very cheesy very nice take a look at that action   right there guys plenty of parmesan my fingers  are buttered up ridiculous we've got that cheese   pizza action right there this is going to be a  little bit of a non-traditional type of calzone   i'll explain in just a second but as you guys  can see we've got some white sauce there this   really looks and smells pretty fantastic right now  let's give this a go it's the crazy calzony over   here at little caesars let's do it oh and did i  mention this is super cheesy right now here we go hmm straight up cheese pizza with lots of parmesan  on top of it there it's pretty good and of course   it's that familiar little caesars flavor right  there guys straight cheese pizza nice large   action with this light tang from the sauce on the  inside and toastiness of the bread on the bottom   not as toasty as i would have liked but that's  usually the case when it comes to these fast   food pizzas but even still very tasty and lots  of parmesan lots of parmesan let's keep going in it's tasty though but of course the wild card  with this one is the main selling point of it   a.k.a the calzony portion and honestly this is  trying to simulate that as much as it could   considering that it's just a folded over  pizza actually guys the way that they're   doing this here but even still it's got that  pocket of dough it's not really traditional   in the sense of having ricotta cheese on  the inside and a lot of cheese in general   i mean a classic calzone has actually got that  but even still this looks pretty fantastic let's   try the very back of this with that white  sauce i want to give this a shot here we go whoa it's a thicker type of cheese not just  sauce i don't know if little caesars is trying   to pull a magic trick on me right now but that  white sauce is trying to simulate ricotta to me   believe it or not it seems a lot thicker and as  you can see right there it is absolutely thicker   so i'm getting the essence of what that mouthfeel  would be by biting into a regular calzone with a   lot of mozzarella cheese and that actually  ricotta cheese as it's supposed to be but   with that garlic white sauce action i got to  admit guys this is actually really really tasty   so far and with the parmesan garnish on the  top you can't fade that let's keep going in that's really tasty yeah that white sauce  is playing with me it's got a thickness to   it that's really kind of simulates ricotta to me  and i'm really digging that and if you look even   closer it looks like we've got little specks of  pepperoni in there you can actually get this with   julienne pepperoni a.k.a thin cut pepperoni as the  normal one as well but actually with the cheese   i wanted to actually go for a little bit more  of the extra cheesy flavor and simulate more   of a classic calzone but it looks like i've  got a little bit of pepperoni action that's   kind of peppered in there which is not bad but  guys beautiful situation with that parmesan and   the butteriness is absolutely there in the back of  this is absolutely awesome it's more of a hyper   breadstick but with a thicker type of cheese  that's trying to simulate ricotta in my opinion and   even still it's got a lot of garlic flavor as it's  dripping right there look at that pretty awesome   all right i see you little caesars i definitely  see you you're kind of playing with me right now   thinking this is actually a real calzone with this  type of sauce that's on the inside but even still   it's very delicious nonetheless and  speaking of delicious let's see how   amazing this is gonna be with some  of their delicious crazy sauce action   right here as well we got a nice little bite  right there let's give this a shot here we go crazy breadstick action that's what i'm getting  with this right now but with that sauce pretty   good and by sauce i mean that garlic white sauce  because guys i gotta say it really is the wild   card on top of the overall form of what they're  trying to do here this is really very cool and   i'm really glad this is here because without it  it would literally just feel like a little bit   of a stuffed pizza folded over but with this  it's giving you more of that essence of what a   calzone is and again with that crazy sauce action  here let's just go for a nice bite on this one   very lovely situation guys really really  nice nice tang and it's really adding an   overall another dimension of flavor even with  the little pepperonis that are actually in here   right now i don't know if it's supposed  to be like that but i'm still digging it definitely digging it so yeah i like this even  though it really doesn't feel like a full-on   calzone to me what they're trying to do here i  see promotionally what they're trying to push   with it naturally but overall it really does  feel like a hyper breadstick with a little bit   of stuff goodness on the inside but again it  comes down to that garlic white sauce as the   wild card it really does look like a ninja  throwing star to me it's really different   and i gotta say that's really one of the main  selling points on top of the flavor of it   pretty cool all right so as i'm literally  melting in my car here right now let's go   for one more bite we'll close this one up after  the rating but guys another tasty item over here   at little caesars even though it's not exactly  like a calzone the essence of it is there but   again i'm loving the hybrid factor and it looks  really interesting one more bite we'll close it up well let me give you another shot of one of  the slices here and as you can see we've got   nice little pieces of pepperoni in here i'm  not sure if it's supposed to come like that   with the straight cheese variant but even still  i am digging the flavor either way i think it's   adding the right accent to everything in the back  here because there's not so much pepperoni it's   more cheese but again the wild card on top of just  the overall fold and the butter and the parmesan   is going to be that garlic white sauce guys it  really is pretty interesting and i got to admit   the mouthfeel is very reminiscent of a calzone  even though i wish it was just a little bit   bigger in the back it is still very cool and again  the shape is awesome pizza pizza well a folded   over shape does not necessarily a calzone make  so to speak guys like i've said all throughout   this review while the essence of a calzone is  technically there i mean you're getting the mouth   feel when you bite into it i mean the thickness  is pretty decent in the back for this to truly   be an authentic calzone it needs to have a lot of  ricotta cheese and a lot more mozzarella cheese   but they're trying to give you the best of both  worlds and basically it's just a hybrid pizza that   offers you a similar experience at the same time  being very visually interesting and while there's   plenty of hybrid pizzas of this type online on  social media naturally with a full-on calzone with   a pizza attached to it with more of a fold-over  type effect i think they should have gone that   particular route that would have been very cool  and something truly different and much closer   to the real thing but even still you're getting a  pretty decent value here for $8.49 and again it does   seem to be the best of both worlds so i'll meet  you halfway little caesars i'll meet you halfway   so with that said i'm going to have to give the  cheesy variant of this all new crazy calzony here   at little caesars a pretty decent 8.5 out of 10 at its core it's still a large   cheese pizza with the same familiar little caesars  flavor but the real wild card with this one all   throughout the review as you're hearing is gonna  be that garlic white sauce on top of the overall   fold the way it's designed and naturally with  plenty of parmesan and butteriness in the back   still a very tasty situation but again it smacks  of a huge breadstick either way pair it up with   that crazy sauce it's still delicious and again  the value is pretty banging at $8.49 i would   probably rock this one again all right so now the  obvious question because if you've made it this   far into the review i have a feeling i know the  answer to this one are you going to be giving this   one a shot i mean does this look pretty banging  to you drop some comments down below what do you   think of the overall innovation of what this  is in terms of what it's trying to simulate   have you had a real calzone i mean legit calzone  how do you think it compares overall if you've   had this already drop those comments down below  and definitely let me know and with that this is   Ian K closing out another high quality foodie  feature for you here on peep this out reviews   bringing you brand new content every single week  here on my channel so while you stay tuned for that next   review coming real soon in the meantime stay  frosty yesir a pretty interesting shape on   this one little caesars but maybe for the next  version of it we can get maybe say four garlic   knots big ones right here in the corners just to  make it even more crazier than it already looks   alright guys until next time i'll talk to you  soon hey thanks for checking out another one of   my reviews but just in case you didn't see the one  before this one you
