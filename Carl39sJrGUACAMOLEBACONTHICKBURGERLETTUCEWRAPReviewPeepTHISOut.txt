keep your health focused new year's resolution intact its flavor lit by fire here at Carl's Jr. as we're about to get into some 100% Black Angus Beef goodness courtesy of the all-new guacamole bacon thickburger lettuce wrap a mouthful of a title with definitely a mouthful of lettuce here guys take a look at that top and bottom it's absolutely housing the good stuff on the inside and see if we can peel some of these layers back and take a further look in looks like we have some SantaFe sauce the guacamole is absolutely there we've got some bacon looks like we've got that third pound Angus beef patty in there as well there is some tomato let's go a little further down here looks like we've got some onions and I believe some pepper jack cheese is hiding right there on the very bottom you can see there this is kind of thrown together but as you can see it is surrounded by plenty of lettuce instead of the buns so definitely keto friendly and definitely looking to deliver that flavor I'm thinking here let's see if it's gonna do just that it's the guacamole bacon thickburger lettuce wrap here at Carl's jr. let's peep out this flavor yeah there is no shortage of lettuce on this whatsoever and that's a good thing considering it as a lettuce wrap right you expect it to be a lot of lettuce around this and there absolutely is I'm also very thankful right now to have a burger diaper on the bottom of this because I really feel a lot of heftiness that's really in the palm of my hand here right now aside from the lettuce being kind of wet on top of it it's kind of a messy situation here guys but let's just get into it but before I take that first bite and like always if you guys are fans of high-quality delicious looking food reviews make sure to hit that subscribe

a title here at Carl's jr. mmm lot of guacamole a lot right off the break that was a lot of rich creamy guacamole flavor in that one guys it just exploded out of this right now my mouth is still watering from it but I am absolutely loving the flavor of the bacon in unison with that that combination is lovely and then you immediately get into the beef itself not super juicy it's actually a little on the drier side when it's so flavorful because of all the guacamole and the pepperjack cheese that I'm getting into as well let's go for another bite and keep going you're gonna want to see this mmm the rich smooth creamy guacamole along with the creaminess of the pepper jack cheese are really saving this one right now along with the bacon guys I got to admit the beef is not really the showcase on this one even though it's 100% Angus beef for sure it's definitely not juicy as you can see it's little on the drier side but man everything is lit up on this the crunch of the onion the tomato even is all drowned out which I'm actually thankful for because tomatoes not one of my favorites but the overall flavor is amazing in the guacamole and bacon department and it's easily the highlight to get this guy's really tasty you know it's really funny with the keto craze the Atkins craze Carl's Jr.'s actually been doing these types of burgers literally for about 16 years lettuce wraps are really nothing new but because of the popularity of Atkins and keto you can easily see why this is the beginning of the new year it's your new year's resolution you want to stay physically fit but you still want to treat yourself this is actually a really tasty option to do just that and for any of you wondering which I actually prefer keto or Atkins I would say I'm a little combination of both I mean I love bread personally so for me Atkins definitely works keto pretty much eliminates carbs altogether so eventually your body goes into ketosis and you're burning ketones for energy where Atkins is a slow integration of carbs as you go but you can kind of balance it so from my height my weight I kind of prefer Atkins personally but every so often not by choice it's usually by circumstance sometimes I find myself with hardly any carbs at all so I guess ketone is kind of like in-between what I usually do but I like the idea of having this option and like I said it's nothing new it's just the marketing for them but guys the creaminess of the guacamole and all the flavors of this burger has is selling it easily I am NOT missing the bun whatsoever on this it is pretty bangin let's go for one more bite and I'm around this one out and then we'll give it that rating guys really tasty so take a look at this lettuce garden in my hand here right now guys this is probably taking up the whole screen right now for you and as you can see it is lit up with the lettuce goodness here everything on the inside like I said is really delivering I only wish the patty itself was just a little bit juicier but in terms of the thickness it's not bad doesn't really feel like a third pound to me before cooking but it definitely is surrounded by the good stuff the creamy guacamole the pepper jack cheese the bacon actually is awesome as well everything about this is just delicious and the flavor really jumps out at you it's really good you know as this review is going on I'm kind of thinking this is more of an educational piece on the differences between Atkins and keto so if you guys are really down with that type of subject matter I hope you liking what you're hearing so far because actually this is a really good alternative for both of those types of diets to incorporate should you wish to go that route and now that I think about it they're not really diets they're lifestyle choices so this is very easy to incorporate and guys like I said the flavor deliver is if you're a fan of Black Angus beef here at Carl's jr. I'd probably ask to make sure that it's super juicy for you but everything else really delivers on that that is just a bangin choice so with that said I'm gonna have to give the guacamole bacon thickburger lettuce wrap here at Carl's jr. a pretty solid 8 out of 10 the only thing in my opinion that really hurts this one aside from the dryness of the patty not being there for me right now is the price point at $8.29 that's crazy guys that's before a drink and before fries once you add those two into the mix you're over $11 here on the west coast so no bueno for that whatsoever but guys if you can overlook that and go for this every once in a while I think you're gonna like what you find with this one because like I said the flavor absolutely delivers it is pretty bangin but of course the obvious question is that this looks pretty bangin too you drop some comments down below first things first are you a fan of the keto or Atkins lifestyle and if you are fan of either are you gonna be giving this one a shot drop those comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K closing out another episode of peep this out cheaters cam style after hours here at Carl's jr. bringing you brand new content every single week here on my channel so while you stay tuned for that next review coming real soon in the meantime stay frosty yesir some 100% Black Angus beef goodness topped off with some freshly made guacamole that's just a beautiful situation no matter how you wrap it alright guys until next time I'll talk to you soon but hey real quick before you go and just in case you haven't already take a look at the last review that I've put out right up over here along with what I think YouTube's gonna recommend for you to check out as well as always I think you'll find something like in both of them and I'll definitely catch ya in the next one see ya
