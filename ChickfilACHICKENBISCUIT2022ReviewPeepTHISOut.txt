 well good morning and welcome or welcome  back to the channel everyone it's ian K   where today i'm over at chick-fil-a to check out  something i have never tried until right now and   i'm pretty excited about it that's right and as  you already know it's their fan favorite chicken   biscuit so stay tuned because it's up next welcome  to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty all right it's some chick-fil-a action  early in the a.m with their fan favorite   chicken biscuit my first time trying this  guys and as you can see we've got a nice   buttery situation in front of us here right  now let's break this one down real quick   yes sir this is looking pretty solid take  a look at this buttermilk biscuit already   guys baked fresh on site a very lovely situation  and a pretty decent size let's pop it and take a   look underneath and what you're going to find is  the other star of the show a very nice piece of   boneless chicken breast here at chick-fil-a hand  breaded as always and of course pressure cooked   and 100% refined peanut oil for that classic  look and i gotta say this is looking really   really nice underneath it looks like we've got  nothing there but more of the buttery goodness   of the biscuit but guys this is a fairly decent  size i have to say and it smells very very fresh   all right so let's not waste any more time  on this one i can't wait to get into it this   is the fan favorite chicken biscuit here at  chick-fil-a let's peep out this flavor yes sir   this biscuit is feeling pretty scrumptious in  my hands right now guys i can really feel the   butter on the top and bottom and obviously  the presentation on this is looking really   nice a very simple build on this one i mean it's  just chicken and a biscuit but guys the flavor   i have a feeling is going to deliver because the  aroma in my car is pretty awesome let me confirm   the goodness finally for you it's the chicken  biscuit here at chick-fil-a let's peep this out very buttery that's good well right off the break  that was definitely not a dry bite and sometimes   you run the risk of actually getting a biscuit  that's not really quite up there but this one   is up there in terms of the flavor and the  quality guys the buttery goodness that i'm   tasting with this one it's very moist very  freshly made and when you combine that with   that white meat chicken right there guys a lovely  situation it's the classic chick-fil-a flavor   but with a very nice quality biscuit to go  with i am really digging this already let's   go for another bite and we're going to get  into some honey real soon as well hang on wow that is really good well i am so digging the  fact that this biscuit is not falling apart at   all you can really see the quality again  guys and combined with the chicken on top   of it the flavor so far is really delivering i'm  totally digging the amount of flavor this has got   and the buttery goodness overall is a very lovely  situation you really don't need anything else to   go with this i would think but you know what we're  gonna get into some honey because we gotta do that   yeah i figured why not i don't usually get honey  with biscuits but i figured this is actually   something i think that would go pretty nicely with  it and considering i've done so many variations of   biscuits over the years most notably from carl's  jr some from burger king as well i gotta say guys   this is really up there in terms of the quality  of what i got here pretty much close to mickey   d's believe it or not and being that they're one  of the kings in the breakfast game you'd expect   that but i have to say the chick-fil-a variation  feels more like a country home style situation   and the quality is pretty good and again guys  just take a look at that on the outside here   it is baked perfectly and the thickness is  really nice it's kind of crumbly but it's   not falling apart at all very moist with that  butter situation but of course we got to do a   little bit of the honey action because i figured  why not let's just give this a shot real quick   we'll get this ready to go all right let's  give this a shot here hopefully that's gonna   stay in focus for you a little bit of that  honey goodness wow that is really quality   honey as well very thick let's give  this a shot again take a look at that   very very lovely i'm having fun doing  this in the morning let's give this a shot oh come on oh that is amazing very sweet  ingredients honey nothing else whoa   that really lights this up beautifully guys  take a look at that wow the buttery goodness   of this biscuit man i gotta do this again hang  on one second i am like blown away right now   the honey is amazing with this oh my god the  buttery goodness of the biscuit on top of   the sweetness of the honey the flavor of the  chicken that is a beautiful combination wow oh my god it is super rich and super  moist even more so with the honey mmm   all right definitely a delicious situation  on this i am blown away you know what   let's do it again can you tell i'm enjoying this  wow hands down one of the best breakfast biscuits   i think i have ever had from a fast food  spot by far why did i wait so long to do   this i have no idea considering my very  first chick-fil-a review on the channel   was the chicken minis back in the day guys really  the mini version of these but this is the way to   go to be honest the quality is just crazy it's  hearty to bite into let's go for another bite wow insane in freaking sane yeah that was truly  the way to go with this i gotta say guys the   honey lights this one up even further i mean it's  flavorful on its own as you're getting that just   probably throughout this review right now right  this is seriously a very very delicious biscuit   sandwich in the morning from chick-fil-a  but when you add that pure honey action   you already know what it is that was  an amazing situation of sweet goodness   on top of the buttery goodness and the overall  thickness like i said is very hearty on this one   very delicious overall and an easy recommendation  to give this one a shot chances are many of you   probably already have by this point right i  mean i'm a little late to the party with this   all right so before we wrap the review up with  the rating coming up next guys let me just show   you one more time with us here a very very tasty  breakfast option over here and i gotta say this is   easily something to go in on a very simple build  on this one but the quality speaks for itself   that buttermilk action is really really awesome  with the biscuit and of course the flavor of the   chicken but once you add that honey situation  a very lovely situation and just to go around   really quick on this one guys it is very  very tasty just delicious across the board   and an easy recommendation obviously very good so  with that said i'm gonna have to give the chicken   biscuit over here at chick-fil-a the obvious 10  out of 10 guys it was a beautiful situation right   from the get-go because of the quality over  all of the ingredients in that one i mean the   buttery goodness of the biscuit you can taste  pretty nicely and of course the flavorfulness   and juiciness of that white meat chicken the  light hand breading that it's got the classic   chick-fil-a flavor which is beautiful across the  board as well the combination works extremely well   and i can see why a lot of people really dig  this one once you add that pure honey though   that is where things really come alive even  further and i gotta say the overall sweetness adds   across the board to everything that you're  getting with that one and it's an easy add-on i'd   highly recommend adding pure honey every time you  get this because like i said it takes that one to   new flavor levels really really awesome stuff and  i'm glad to have finally given this one a shot   yes sir it's totally worth a 10 out of 10 without  a doubt on this one guys but do me a quick favor   drop some comments down below let me know if  you've given this one a go over the years and   if it's actually your favorite thing on the menu  over here and if it isn't what is the best thing   that you'd like to get for breakfast over here  at chick-fil-a drop those comments down below and   definitely let
