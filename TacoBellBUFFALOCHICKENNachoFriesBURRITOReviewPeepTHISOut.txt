 hey everyone I'm back at it this time over at Taco Bell because obviously after taking a look at the Buffalo nacho fries recently you know I had to go in in the burrito version right so stay tuned because it's up next welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty so here we go all wrapped up good to go it's the buffalo chicken nacho fries burrito featuring everything the buffalo chicken nacho fries has to offer all on the inside of a nice warm tortilla here so starting off with the obvious we've got the nacho fries featuring those bold Mexican spices we've got some shredded chicken the three cheese nacho blend we have some buffalo sauce we have some shredded cheese reduced fat sour cream and pico de gallo and naturally this is made to be ultra portable here guys I'm gonna lift one of these up here just to take a closer look a little bit hefty but a little on the small side as well but a very nice amount of filling and if that very familiar buffalos smell is coming through as well this is looking really really tasty definitely portable and definitely awesome looking for sure let's see if the flavor is gonna deliver on this one it's the buffalo chicken nacho fries burrito here at Taco Bell let's peep out this flavor yeah it wouldn't be taco bell without a portable version of their main promo item and admittedly this actually looks really tasty guys the buffalo sauce really adds a nice amount of color overall to everything and the combination I think just works very nicely even on the inside of a burrito so let's see how amazing this one's gonna be because I have a feeling if you've seen my recent review of the buffalo chicken nacho fries which is popping up on your screen here right now you know what to expect but before I take the first

soon as brand-new content drops every week but guys here we go let's just get into it the portable version of the buffalo chicken nacho fries the burrito variant let's do it   that's kind of fun actually alright so like I was expecting it's very "carby" you're gonna get a mouthful of potatoes and the tortilla right away and then immediately into the nice sizzle from that buffalo sauce and I have to admit again very similar to the BK version guys I love the sizzle I love the creaminess it's thick and the overall cheese and everything with it is pretty nice as well I didn't get any chicken in that bite but everything else is singing nicely the buffalo sauce is a major highlight the main component of this on top of the nacho fries and overall the seasonings and everything are working very nicely let's keep going with it mm-hmm there's the chicken I don't know if you can kind of see that in the middle but just like my nacho fries review I've got chunks of chicken in this one guys and I'm really diggin that I think it really makes the difference with this I almost don't want to try the shredded chicken in mini form because I think it will be just drowned out with everything but the flavorfulness of everything is there and overall that buffalo sauce is a huge huge win this needs to stay on the menu it is really flavorful and definitely adds so much to this on top of the reduced fat sour cream that's trying to cool it off just a bit just a nice combination you know as tasty as the flavor is on this and don't get me wrong it absolutely is especially with the chunkiness of the chicken which I'm really diggin my version of it right now it's really good with that the size itself is a little on the smaller side overall and considering this is the same price as the regular buffalo chicken nacho Fries themselves you'd expect it to be just a little bit heartier a little bit larger and while I get they can't do it exactly like that it should be priced accordingly because you're actually getting less fries in this version and pretty much less of everything together even though it's portable I think if you're gonna try and match the main platter itself at least make the burrito just a little bit bigger so it doesn't feel like you're losing out but as it stands this is pretty nice as a portable version but I wouldn't get this again strictly because I'd rather go for the larger fry version of it there naturally you're gonna get more to go with but guys still very tasty exactly like that just a little bit more portable but also a little less quantity for the money so that's no bueno for that let's go for one more bite we'll wrap this one up with the rating and finish out the review well judging by this cross-section shot I guess I have about six or seven fries in here along with all the other ingredients so while I do like the toastiness of the tortilla naturally it's the same thing that you'd expect from Taco Bell it's warm it definitely holds everything to get a nicely everything on the inside is really the star of the show as it should be I just wish there was just more of it for the money but guys the buffalo sauce is a huge highlight you guys are gonna dig that the quality is very high add in that reduced fat sour cream and of course the chunkier chicken in my version today and this is definitely off the chart really really tasty I just wish it was a little less expensive for what it is so with that said I'm gonna have to give the burrito variant of the buffalo chicken nacho fries here at Taco Bell a pretty solid 7.9 out of 10 I really can't go much higher than that guys because like I said for the same money I really want to get something a little bit more similar in size it's not a little bit larger in burrito form and considering how flavorful that is it really is a highlight now keep in mind I did get the chunkier chicken version so that definitely scores points above that so take that for what you will if it was the regular shredded chicken this probably would have been a little bit less than that so right up on an 8 I think is a fair score with this one guys but let me know what you guys think down below do you personally agree with my assessment and are you definitely gonna give this one a shot drop those comments down below let me know if you're interested to try the burrito version of this and speaking of which how often do you get the promo burrito versions of the main items that they come out with or do you just stick with the regular nacho fries on whatever the topping is drop those comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K closing out another episode of peep this out bringing you brand new content every single week here on my channel so while you
