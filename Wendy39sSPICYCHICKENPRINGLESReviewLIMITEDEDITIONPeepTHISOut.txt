 what's going on everyone and welcome back to  another high quality foodie feature for you here   on the channel a quickie for you this time because  as you obviously know by the title to this one   i found them feast your eyes on the wendy's spicy  chicken flavored pringles guys already digging the   marketing with this one very very cool packaging  and very reminiscent to the baconator variant that   came out about a year ago i'm really digging this  here this is supposed to have notes of spice the   signature flavor that they use in their chicken  sandwich as well as some fried chicken goodness   here so very very cool on this one of course  we've got that signature wendy's top right there   apparently this is usable with a code that you can  do online and get a free chicken sandwich there   but i'm not gonna waste any more time with  this one let's just get it right on into it   very excited to pick this one up at my  local target and let me just say guys again   the marketing looks really cool so i'm gonna  let you guys get the first look on the inside   and they look pretty nondescript maybe a little  bit of dusting in there as well looking pretty   cool can't wait to peep this out with you guys  let's grab one of these up here and take a look   a little bit of the light dusting looking pretty  nice and i got to see these are already smelling   pretty aromatic right now i want to say a little  bit of that chicken action is already in my car   let's give this a shot guys it's the wendy's  spicy chicken flavored pringles let's do it already miles above the baconator variant  wow absolutely fried chicken action it's   almost like a chicken broth for what that  is but supposed to have the signature blend   of their crispy chicken sandwich here  the spicy chicken let's keep going in this is simulating this one so much better  than the burger variant wow really liking this   guys take a look at that there i'm not getting  any notes of tomato lettuce or mayo thankfully   but definitely the same type of blend that  they're saying is on their chicken sandwich   you can definitely get that it's getting a little  bit more peppery as i'm going with this one here   let me show this to you again again just a quickie  shot this is kind of what i do on my live stream   just giving you the shots of the chips here  but like i said this is simulating a little bit   more closely to the spicy chicken sandwich from  wendy's at least in my opinion it's pretty good absolutely the more i'm eating this the  more the residue is building with that   this is really really tasty oh yeah absolutely  digging these what are the calories on this   looks like about 150 calories the usual about 15  chips or so so it's pretty much average as all the   other pringles but with the actual promo with this  one i am really digging that i'm really looking   forward to using the code to get a free chicken  sandwich over at wendy's very very slick on this   this was at my local target actually a buck 59  a can i picked up two of them naturally because   these are actually going into the studio on  the shelf behind me to go with the baconator   but very very slick on this one and again  very very cool packaging on this one guys   i'm really digging the overall look it jumps off  the shelf as you can tell and again that wendy's   collabo with pringles i am absolutely digging  out what they're gonna do next i have no idea but   i guess it makes sense to do the baconator first  and then go right into what i think they're known   for mostly which is their chicken and i think  that just lends more closely to a potato chip   to be honest because of the seasoning of that  crispy chicken sandwich in general that spicing   is pretty spot on this is much closer to that so  definitely a banging job with this collabo easily   overall rating with this one 9 out of 10  by far guys this is really probably one of the   better pringles i've tried and again a little  bit of that chicken residue supposedly i guess   on my tongue is what i'm tasting here it really  is more of like a broth type of chicken flavor   but then you're getting the spicing that  they're using with the signature blend on   their chicken sandwich in this so nice quality  overall and again just really not too much else   to show you here i'm just gonna keep showing  you the can because it looks really really cool   but an easy recommendation to give this one a shot  if you guys have already given this one a shot   drop some comments down below let me know what you  thought of this one in particular do you prefer   this over say the baconator variant i'm kind of  curious to hear your opinion of that one that one   from what i remember was more like a ketchup  type of chip it really wasn't anything crazy   this like i said lends so much better to the  pringles platform because of what it is and also   the flavor that it is but drop some comments down  below and let me know what you thought of this one   and with that this is Ian K closing out another  high quality foodie feature for you here on the   channel and like i always say got brand
