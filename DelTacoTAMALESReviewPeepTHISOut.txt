me ask you a question are these pretty authentic tamales are they pretty good really all right cool thank you looks like we've got the seal of approval awesome hey thanks so much stay frosty and Happy Holidays to you all right we'll see ya buh-bye all right guys let's peep this out so here we go with the smothered tamales here at Del Taco and in terms of presentation this actually looks really really tasty guys aside from the Kryptonite all in the very top there with the cilantro I am really diggin how this looks here what we've got our two tamales which consists of masa which is essentially corn dough and it's filled with shredded pork on the inside and then topped off in this case we've got some green sauce on one side and we've got some red sauce on the other and of course we've got some shredded cheese there's some sour cream but overall a very hefty plate I got to say when I put this thing down it kind of went plunk on the top of my middle console here but looking really really nice guys and in terms of what the cost is on this one for five bucks not too bad for what it is like I said the size is pretty decent let's give it a go and see how the flavor is gonna go with these it's the smothered tamales here at Del Taco let's peep out this flavor you know it's funny the promo for this all around the restaurant actually shows the cilantro as just kind of a garnish on the very top but they really loaded mine up so I have a lot of it off to the side over here guys but still presentation wise it really looks pretty good alright so let's get into this but

as soon as brand-new content drops every week so here we go let me grab a little piece on the end here I'm gonna start off with the red sauce and guys oh wow some shredded goodness already a little bit of that masa goodness the main tamale itself and of some cheese and all the other goodies with it you know what still a little sour cream real quick too here we go the tamales the holiday tradition here at Del Taco mm-hmm yeah mm-hmm well as you heard me asking the drive-thru I wanted to know if these were really authentic and I got to say these are pretty awesome guys very very nice the only problem I have with this right now is that the masa that it's wrapped in is really really thick so there's a decent amount of meat here but it's more of the masa and I was afraid of that but the flavor is pretty tasty let's keep going with it mmm flavorful though it is pretty nice quality though so if you like a lot of masa and your tamales I got to say this is actually not bad for what this is the meat itself is fairly flavorful but it really is more of a masa show than anything else but I do like it guys I mean the flavor is really good and of course the sour cream and the cheese and of course the sauce nice combination all right let me go for a little bit of the green sauce in the back and of course avoid the cilantro avoid too cilantro here we go oh that's nice that is really nice I like the green better than the red really tasty a little bit of spiciness to it which I really like but the overall flavor is a little bit better than the red at least in my opinion anyway so for the one or two of you who don't know what a tamale is it's essentially like I said that masa which is the corn dough that they wrap into a corn husk and they steam it and then naturally it packs in all the flavors you can choose between typically any type of meat really chicken beef in this case shredded pork and depending upon where you get them of course your mileage may vary in this case for a dollar more you're basically get the smothered version of this you can also get a chili cheese version as well I thought that what kind of detract from the overall flavor this is a little bit more of the authentic style so maybe I'll come back and give that a go but guys I really like this it really is tasty again I just wish that the masa itself was just a little bit thinner and the meat itself maybe just a little bit more plentiful but what you do get is pretty good all right let me try and balance this as best as I can for you here with this final close-up shot of this guy's a nice cross-section shot of the goodness as you guys can see the thickness of that masa on the side is definitely there and of course in the very middle you've got all that shredded pork goodness but guys just a nice quality tamale it definitely has some very authentic flavor and depending upon your type of sauce in my case I like the green this is definitely a very very tasty option especially for the holidays if you're into that but in general give it a go it's tasty yeah these are pretty tasty and definitely pretty smothered and I think you guys can pretty much agree with the amount of red sauce and green sauce on top of this as well as the sour cream the shredded cheese and unfortunately my case the cilantro is definitely packed a pretty nice package for five bucks it really wasn't bad so with that said I'm gonna have to give the smothered tamales a holiday tradition here at Del Taco a pretty rock-solid 8.2 out of 10 and I really can't go much higher than that because like I said earlier I only wish there was just a little bit more of that shredded pork in the middle and maybe a little less of the masa notwithstanding the fact that there was just a lot of cilantro on that that was very easy to push off to the side but overall guys a very solid package a definite recommendation and with the holidays here how could you not want to go for this especially if you've got a del taco in the area pretty good now the question is are you gonna go to del taco and give this one a shot drop some comments down below first and foremost are you a fan of the menu
