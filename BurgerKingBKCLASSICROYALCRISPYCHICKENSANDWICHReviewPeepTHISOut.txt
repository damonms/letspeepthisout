 what's going on everyone and welcome to the  channel it's Ian K where today I'm over at   good old Burger King to check out one of four  all new BK Royal crispy chicken sandwiches   they've got on their menu and guys to kick  this review off I'm starting off with the   classic so stay tuned because it's up next  welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K   stay frosty Oh Ch'King how I'm gonna miss you  because now begins the next evolution of the   chicken sandwich here at Burger King guys Feast  your eyes on the BK classic Royal crispy chicken   sandwich a mouthful of a title but then again  this is looking like a pretty tasty mouthful   of a chicken sandwich let's break this one on down  real fast all right so starting us off is a fairly   toasty yet soft looking potato bun and once we pop  it of course we've got plenty of shredded lettuce   and a brand new savory sauce and as we pan on down  guys we've got two slices of tomato and that's all   sitting on top of their brand new crispy white  meat breast filet and I gotta say looking very   crispy very wide and definitely it fills out  this bun pretty nicely underneath it we've got   more of that savory sauce but again coming back  to that chicken it's not so much thick as it is   wide and it's looking nice and golden so let's  not waste any more time on this one this is the   all-new BK classic Royal crispy chicken sandwich  here at Burger King let's peep out this flavor   so yeah looking very crispy and definitely  wide guys it fills out this potato bun very   very nicely and guys again I'm gonna miss the  Ch'King because I really love the size of that   personally with the hand breaded goodness in store  but this looks pretty decent I have to admit let's   give it a shot and see if the flavor is going to  deliver on it though it's the all new again one   more time BK classic crispy chicken sandwich here  at Burger King mouth full of a title let's do it hmm okay well right off the break I gotta say  that savory sauce is really the main standout   with the sandwich so far guys it's a little bit  of tartness a little bit of Tang but it's also   got a little bit of an Italian Flair to it it  tastes like it's got Italian seasoning and it   goes pretty nicely with the crispy coating on the  outside of the chicken itself but as you can see   it's a little bit of a thinner Patty but very  very wide fried up beautifully as you can see   with light seasoning on the chicken itself but  guys the combination of that savory sauce with   it is really the Highlight so far pretty nice  and of course you've got that tomato action right   there as well as the lettuce let's keep going  in guys interesting let's keep doing it foreign yeah that savory sauce is the real standout  with this guys I mean it's a creamy type of   sauce but again more of an Italian Flair like  basil Italian seasoning and it's creamy and   again the tartness and the Tang that it's  got It's noticeably different you're going   to notice it right away when you taste it  it is absolutely something brand new over   here at BK and again with the thinness  of that Patty although I wish it was a   little bit thicker it is very nice and it's  complementing everything on the inside of   this let's go for another couple more bites  guys tasty tasty tasty let's keep going in um yeah I'm so glad that showcasing the sauce  with this guys that savory sauce is perfectly   named because it is and like I said with that  Italian Flair I'm totally digging that the fact   that there's so much of it as well I don't think  you're gonna mind it with this very very nice guys   and honestly I'm so glad I'm starting out with  the classic variant because I wanted to see the   base ingredients with this before we move on to  the other three that you're gonna see in the not   too distant future but guys again the quality of  the chicken is decent and although I wish it was   a little bit thicker like I said the quality  of the sauce along with the crispiness of that   coating I have to say on the chicken itself is  an amazing situation tomato of course not really   my all time favorite so I'm dealing with  it but at the same time it's a nice accent   along with the lettuce to Showcase it because  visually it looks pretty nice but guys decent   so far and I'm glad to really see what this  is all about the Royal name naturally with it   there it's the next level of chicken sandwiches  over here at BK pretty tasty for what it is but   of course I'm already looking forward to the  other three variations of this Royal crispy   chicken sandwich over here at Burger King  so naturally stay tuned for that because   you're gonna see them but guys very decent  on this particular one one very very tasty   let me go for one more bite on this one because  I think I've gotten pretty much everything that   I need to out of it and then we'll wrap this  review up with the rating coming up next but   guys again a very nice outing at least the  initial one here giving these Royal crispy   chicken sandwiches a shot over here Burger King  one more bite and we'll wrap this one up hang on well I can really use a chicken sandwich diaper  with this one guys there's plenty of that savory   sauce falling out the back of this one so let me  make this one really quick for you again a very   nice outing with this first initial version of  these real crispy chicken sandwiches and I have   to say again the savory sauce the main highlight  definitely something to check out for sure and I   would recommend giving this one a go just to give  yourself a preview of what to expect from the   other three at least from a baseline standpoint  pretty nice on this particular one so with that   said I'm gonna have to give the new BK classic  Royal crispy chicken sandwich here at Burger   King a mouthful of a title a pretty decent 8  out of 10 and I'm not gonna go much higher than   that because guys like I mentioned all throughout  this review this really is the intro sandwich and   I think it gives you a nice little preview of  what to expect down the line for the other three   but like I said that savory sauce is the main  highlight with this particular one and although   I do wish the chicken was a little bit thicker the  quality is pretty tasty and overall the sandwich   works because all those flavors do come together  very nice on the outer coating of that as well   it's definitely crispy as advertised so of course  that's a plus but naturally it's really making me   want to get into the other three which you're  gonna see very soon here on the channel so stay   tuned all right so do me a quick favor drop some  comments down below what are your initial thoughts   of this Royal crispy chicken
