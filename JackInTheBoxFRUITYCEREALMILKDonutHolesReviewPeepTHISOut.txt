 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty good ol jack in the box is bring back their donut holes that a reviewed a few months back and this time out we've got a brand new flavor to check out so let's do just that it's the fruity cereal milk donut holes here at jack in the box and initial first impressions just an OK amount of dusting on this guys this is actually supposed to feature cereal milk type of coating but it appears to be more of a powdered type of dusting along with some fruity goodness there mixed in with it in this case I gotta it's more of the appearance I gotta say here but again the size of the donuts just OK as well these appear to be a little smaller than the ones I did the first time out but they are definitely warm and they definitely have a nice amount of thickness to them just by squeezing them slightly here but overall appearance-wise just OK so far so let's get into these and see if they're gonna deliver that fruity milky experience these are the fruity cereal milk donut holes here at jack in the box 4 for just a buck let's peep out this flavor yeah I don't know guys these definitely smell pretty fresh but the size is absolutely smaller than the original ones I reviewed a few months back and I think you'll find that evidence in my review popping up on your screen here right now but let's just get into this one hopefully they're gonna deliver the flavor but like always before we do if you guys are fans of high quality delicious looking food reviews make sure to hit that subscribe button down below and don't forget to

here we go mmm well initially I got a very nice bit of that fried donut action right there but then shortly right after that the coating is coming through and again it's like a powdered type of coating that soaks into the oil of the donut itself and it gives you like a milky type of consistency but believe it or not it's a little on the sour side I don't know why but it feels like it's sour to me the donut is tasty though decent amount of cakiness on the inside but man that's like a sour type of coating I'm not really getting anything fruity with this I think it's more of the appearance on the outside but overall I'm not really diggin' this guys I'm not really diggin' this at all I mean what's kind of saving this is the nice freshness of the donut holes themselves and the size notwithstanding they're definitely smaller I'm not really feeling this powdered type of coating on the outside I was hoping it was gonna be more of a glazed type of thing with some kind of fruity dusting but that's not the case I guess they take 4 of these drop them into a bag shake them up with that stuff and put a little bit of that colored coating on the outside but again I'm getting a soury type of taste I'm not really a fan so far yeah no definitely not well I was thinking this one was gonna be starting out pretty decent considering the flavor of the donut holes themselves but guys overall this coating is not working for me I think this would have benefitted better with being a glaze and then having a little more of that fruitiness come out but as it stands it's a little sour tasting and while it does have some sweetness it's not really working for me the actual donut itself though is pretty nice as you guys can see in the middle right there it is absolutely cakey but guys for the size for the price I guess it is what it is for a quarter but I have definitely had these larger and I am not a fan of this coating at all no bueno well the first version of these were absolutely pretty tasty I mean cinnamon and sugar you can't really go wrong with that on top of some fried dough and considering the size at that time as well still a very decent value and the flavor really delivered but with these like I said that coating itself is not working for me I see what they're trying to do by putting the sprinkle in there and having the oil kind of soak it up so it gives you a milky type consistency but that milky consistency is not translating in terms of the flavor again a little on the sour side and I'm not getting a lot of fruity goodness at all but the donut itself is still pretty decent so with that said I'm gonna have to give the fruity cereal milk donut holes here at jack in the box a very mediocre 4 out of 10 and guys I really wanted to stretch this up a little further because of the quality of the donut itself but what they're selling with this one here at least for me doesn't deliver at all I'm tasting a little bit more of greasiness of the donut which is not bad because the flavor is good but that sourness that I'm getting that coating definitely no bueno the next time out jack please let's go with a glaze I'm telling these are gonna benefit from that now I gotta ask if you guys have a jack in the box in your area are you personally gonna be giving these a shot drop some comments down below and if you do have a jack in the area and you've tried the cinnamon sugar donut holes the last time out how do you think these compare to those I'm very curious to hear your thoughts on that one drop some comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K closing out another episode of peep this out bringing you brand new content every single week here on my channel so while you stay tuned for that next review coming real soon in the meantime stay frosty these donut holes are awesome jack don't get me wrong but I think next time out aside from a glazed option which would be awesome let's go for something on the inside of them maybe a vanilla creme or a chocolate creme that would be pretty awesome as well alright guys until next time I'll talk to you soon but hey real quick before you go and just in case you haven't already take a look at the last review I put out right up over here along with what I think YouTube's gonna recommend for you you as well as always I think you'll find something to like in both of them and I'll definitely catch 'ya in the next one see 'ya
