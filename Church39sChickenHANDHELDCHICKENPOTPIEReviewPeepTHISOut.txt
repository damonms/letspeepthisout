 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty hey everyone I'm back at at this time over at Church's Chicken to take a look at a portable version of a true comfort food classic that they've got on special right now just as we're kicking off 2020 so let's check out their all-new handheld chicken potpie and with one of these being $1.79 I decided to go up on that 2 for $3.00 guys that's really the way to go with this as you can see a fairly crispy situation I've got one split right down the middle for you we've got a very solid amount of that chicken pot pie crust and on the inside the chicken pot pie filling a mixture of chicken some veggies and a nice thick amount of tastiness to go around it all guys it's looking very hearty and again the outside of it nice and crispy I waited about six minutes for these and I got to say nice and crispy nice and golden the smell is pretty authentic really really nice on this one let's not waste any more time let's see if that flavors gonna deliver it's the all-new handheld chicken pot pie the mobile version of a comfort food classic here at Church's Chicken let's peep out this flavor yeah this is definitely checking off the boxes in the aroma department for what a chicken pot pie should smell like and the appearance is pretty reminiscent of that as well guys the crust definitely looks a little flaky especially wouldn't see the cross-section of it let's see how the flavor is though but here real quick before I do that unlike always if you guys are fans of high quality delicious looking food reviews make sure to hit that

brand-new here at Church's Chicken mmm that's pretty good yeah that crust is definitely flaky and very reminiscent of a chicken pot pie crust when you pierced it on the top with your fork guys they really began to fall apart as I was biting into that but I did get a nice piece of chicken and the filling on the inside flavor-wise it's not really rich tasting that's the only thing I'm finding here I mean it tastes like chicken it's got a little bit of that thickness to it as well but the flavor is not jumping out at me but it's decent though for what it is let's keep going you know I'm a little conflicted as I'm getting further into this because I am liking the overall texture I love the flakiness of it and you would expect it to be a little on the saltier side since it's completely fried but I'm not getting a lot of overly crazy flavor from the inside of it that's the only thing with us the chicken is fairly plentiful although as you can see I've got a lot of veggies in the end there but there is not a lot going on here otherwise guys that's the only problem with it all right let me bring up the container this comes in real fast because I was a little caught off guard by how flaky this crust was gonna be after biting into that cross-section but guys like I said earlier I'm a little conflicted with the overall flavor with this I like the flakiness of the dough on the outside it's really authentic tasting but once you get into the meat of it so to speak the chicken is just okay the veggies that looks a nice touch naturally having the veggies anyway because that's part of a potpie but the pie like filling overall is not really jumping out and the saltiness is not really there either so it's a little on the bland side but I do like the overall flavor because it's subtle it seems like it's trying to be a really really rich pot pie but it's just not reaching the mark because the filling is not super flavorful but hey 2 for $3.00 not a bad deal at all let's keep going with it and then we'll wrap this one up well I gotta say I definitely like the execution of this one it definitely has that flaky feel to it especially when you bite into it and the overall flavor of the crust itself does deliver top and bottom it really is a very very nice tasting crust in general but unfortunately that is the main highlight of what this is and while I get there's gonna be a lot of people that love the crust in general of pot pies more than anything else I think the balance of having a really really nicely thick rich filling goes a long way on top of the flakiness of the crust to really complement one another I just wish the flavor was a little bit more balanced but still 2 for $3.00 not a bad deal so with that said I'm gonna have to give the handheld chicken pot pie here at Church's Chicken a pretty average 6.5 out of 10 for everything you've heard me mention throughout this review I think it's pretty spot-on at least based upon my experience anyway the crust is an absolute highlight as it should be because it's one of the main features and it's one of the main selling points of it in general I only wish the insides really matched that in terms of flavor but the overall value of what you're getting for 2 for $3.00 is still not a bad deal I would recommend giving it a shot if you've got church's in the area now the question is are you gonna give this one a shot drop some comments down below are you a fan of chicken pot pies to begin with and if you are how enticed are you to try a portable version of it especially from a fast food chicken spot drop
