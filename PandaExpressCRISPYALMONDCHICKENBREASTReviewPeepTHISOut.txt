 what's going on everyone and welcome back  to another high quality foodie feature for   you here on the channel we're this time over at  the panda express innovation kitchen in pasadena   california to check out their all new crispy  almond chicken breast and it's looking pretty   tasty too so stay tuned because it's up next  to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty so here we go with the all-new crispy almond  chicken breast here at panda express and already   i'm definitely getting an orange chicken vibe from  this one guys considering how the chicken looks   very similar the way it's breaded that sauce alone  looks very much like the orange chicken sauce that   they use with the exception of this one having a  few almonds on top as well as chopped onion all   right so let's break this one down what we've got  here is all white meat chicken breasts breaded up   very nicely and then wok tossed in a light garlic  savory sauce along with some crunchy almonds and   a little bit of chopped green onion and being that  this is the panda express innovation kitchen we've   got a few different sides actually instead of the  normal white rice fried rice and chow mein in this   case it's quinoa fried rice and i gotta say it  looks really cool with this crispy almond chicken   pretty nice so let's not waste any more time on  this one let's see if that flavor is going to   deliver this is the all-new crispy almond chicken  breast here at panda express let's peep out this   flavor yesir doesn't the glaze look pretty  awesome on disguise that garlic savory sauce   is lighting this one up big time and i gotta  admit again while this does look like orange   chicken it feels like a more upper scale version  of that and i gotta say the addition of almonds is   definitely a plus pretty cool so far all right  so let me grab a piece of this real quick and   we'll get into this and wow it's actually very  very thick that is a lovely situation guys take   a look at that up close again a little bit of  the almond action on there and again a little   bit of that quinoa on the very bottom that's  really a cool thing actually looking really   really nice here we go it's the crispy almond  chicken breast here at panda express let's do it whoa thick and heavy on that sauce   wow this has the same mouth feel as having orange  chicken guys a little bit of the heat coming up on   the back end just a little bit of a sizzle but  guys very similar to orange chicken but without   the orange it is definitely a savory type of sauce  for sure and as you can see the chicken is pretty   nice the breading is actually pretty nice as well  the ratio in this one looks like about even but so   far guys i'm really digging this glaze on it there  it's definitely got a little bit of sizzle to it   but man it's kind of like i said orange chicken  but without the orange let's keep going in the toastiness of those almonds is definitely  coming through at the very end once you get   past the savoriness of the sauce itself  because it's fairly strong and the sizzle   begins to come in then you get the nice  toasty flavor of those almonds and again   the chicken is pretty nice guys it's breaded up  pretty well this piece anyway is but i'm really   digging this here you can really taste the  quality of the chicken meat it's really tasty   and real quick let me just say i'm so glad this  item is national right now because they had this   actually testing in my area about four months  ago and when i actually went to a location close   to their corporate headquarters to try it they  ran out and it was gone so obviously it was a   pretty successful test market because now we all  have it and i gotta say guys again i really like   the fact that it's given me vibes of orange  chicken which is a favorite over here anyway   but with a little bit of that toasty almond  action and the garlic savoriness that this has   a little bit of quinoa action there let's go for  a little bit of this all together pretty nice oh yeah that quinoa the fried rice action bits  of egg along with that then the almond and all   that saucy goodness banging oh and since i have  orange chicken on the brain right now because the   similarity is definitely there with this one if  you haven't seen the beyond the original orange   chicken review that i did a few weeks ago take a  look at that review popping up on your screen here   right now that was a pretty tasty doppelganger  variant to the original orange chicken that they   have on the menu at panda but i gotta say guys  i'd love to see a beyond version of this with this   type of sauce because again it is really very well  done that garlic goodness you can really taste   that and like it's a little bit of the heat coming  through there but with the almonds added for extra   toastiness and the overall chicken breast quality  itself this is very very nice i can only imagine   a beyond version of that hopefully we'll see  that at some point but this is pretty good i swear this feels like it's getting thicker and  thicker in my mouth as i'm eating this right now   because the sauce is so vibrant and pungent i'm  just going to keep showing it to you guys because   it looks awesome it presents beautifully and the  quality is very very nice again i'm digging that   light heat that this one has got but the quality  of the chicken is selling this one big time   on top of the coating just overall a nice  combination and if you have quinoa fried   rice available to you on the menu at your  local panda express if you happen to that's   an easy recommendation to get it with pretty  solid and let me show it to you real quick   because i definitely enjoy it it's just a nice  alternative outside of the usual chow mein fried   rice or their white rice here it adds just  a dimension in terms of flavor and texture   on top of everything that you're seeing here  already and considering it's made the same way   as fried rice with the egg and the veggies and all  that good stuff it's a little bit of a healthier   alternative on top of it as well pretty good all  right so let's go for one more bite of this one   before we close it up after the rating coming  up right now but guys i gotta say again i'm so   glad to finally be giving this one a shot because  obviously they had a good thing going a few months   ago now we all have it and it's a beautiful  situation one more bite and we'll close it up toasty and super savory too thanks to that sauce  here's one more shot close up for you and as you   can see again guys the glazed goodness is on point  an easy combination i think even with chow mein my   ultimate favorite over here but even still guys so  glad to give this one a shot and again the texture   is very similar to orange chicken but that flavor  is definitely unique similar in appearance but   the flavor is absolutely up there in it really  really nice new crispy almond chicken breast   for a limited time only at panda express yesir  don't let those orange chicken looks fool you with   this one guys as you're seeing here on screen if  you were to actually match up this crispy almond   chicken breast next to the orange chicken you'd  be hard-pressed to tell me that they were actually   different with the exception of the almonds added  to the new one and that's really the thing for me   visually because flavor-wise obviously it's  a different type of sauce but very similar in   appearance but again the presentation is primo  especially on both of them so with that said   i'm gonna have to give the crispy almond chicken  breasts here at panda express a pretty rock solid   9 out of 10 guys it's a nice alternative to  orange chicken in general and the quality of the   sauce is very unique the garlic flavor that it's  got there as well the light sizzle and of course   the toasted almonds on top of it just a very  delicious situation with some juicy chicken breast   meat to go with all right so being that this is  out everywhere now have you personally had it   drop some comments down below what did you think  of the overall flavor of this one and especially   compared to orange chicken how do you think it  compares overall aside from just the flavor of   the orange naturally was it similar in terms of  the mouth feel for you drop those comments down   below and definitely let me know and with that  this is Ian K closing out another high quality   foodie feature for you here on peep this out  reviews bringing you brand new content every   single week here on my channel so while you stay tuned  for that next review coming real soon in the meantime   stay frosty yesir pretty tasty on this one for  sure but like i
