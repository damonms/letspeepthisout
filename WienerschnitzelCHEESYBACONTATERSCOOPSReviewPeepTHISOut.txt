 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty what's going on everyone it's Ian K back again  with another high quality foodie feature for   you here on peep this out reviews this time  over at wienerschnitzel to go in on one of   their all new tater scoops side items and with  three options available how could i not go in   on the one with bacon right so let's go in  on the cheesy bacon tater scoops to see what   it's working with and already it's very strong in  the grilled onions department guys that's a nice   portion on the very top there what we've got here  is scoop shaped potatoes it's actually topped off   with a cheese sauce grilled onions and chopped  bacon and i gotta say this is looking pretty   nice definitely a very saucy situation with that  cheese but those grilled onions look amazing they   definitely went heavy-handed on this one pretty  nice and with all that good stuff on top of what   looks to be thinly shaved wedged potatoes only  kind of curled up just a bit there i'm thinking   this is going to be pretty tasty so let's not  waste any more time let's confirm it for you   it's the cheesy bacon tater scoops here at  wienerschnitzel let's peep out this flavor   you know fried potatoes in virtually any form  is going to be an amazing situation especially   when they're lightly salted but when you top it  off with a cheese sauce grilled onions and some   bacon how bad could this really be right i mean  i guess with the uniqueness of the shape itself   and in this case let me show it to you there it's  basically like a wedge potato but they're kind of   curled up and sliced kind of thin so not bad  for what this is guys and like i said i'm not   expecting this to taste bad alright so before we  get started and like always

brand new content drops   every week alright now i'm assuming they want  you to kind of just pick this up as you go and   actually i already did that for you when i showed  you the close-up the first time so i have a fork   here on the side just in case but let me just try  this real quick and then we'll get into it further tasty well it has just enough soft potato  in the middle and the like crispiness on   the outside let me just kind of show that to you  just so you can kind of see the thickness there   not bad for what this is these are  actually crisped up very nicely   and they're curled very nicely as well so  so far the quality is pretty good of the fry   definitely pretty good and you know what let me  pull up another one for you take a look at that   guys thick cut potato but shaved very very  thin and you have all the scoop good stuff   on the inside there so i'm really digging this  so far i mean the quality of the fry is good   and like i said any type of fried potato is going  to be bomb with some light salt it's pretty tasty   mmm i'm already liking that  the cheese sauce is not bad   alright enough with the small appetizers let's  whip out this fork here and get to some of the   good stuff there is plenty of onions on this  and again while i'm kind of scooping this up   here let me just kind of show you again lots  of goodies guys feast your eyes no shortage   of the grilled onions a very lovely situation  the bacon's a little on the light side though   but oh here's a big piece here right now that  is very very nice the cheese sauce very thick   let's give this a shot guys tater scoops  with all the good stuff on it here we go mmm thick cheese on that that's pretty banging  it's almost like a beer cheese i'm kind of getting   actually and i guess i can kind of expect  that considering this is like a carryover   from oozefest which i actually reviewed one of  their chili cheese entrees not that long ago   take a look at that review popping up on  your screen if you haven't seen it already   lots of cheesy goodness guys but i have  to admit the addition of a fun shape   and some grilled onions is a lovely situation  here and again not too much bacon that's the   only thing naturally what i'm expecting here is  lots of smoky flavor it's light but it's more   of a heavy cheese flavor and the grilled onions  which are marinated pretty nicely it's not bad yeah that's not bad at all it's a  little front loaded there's really   nothing in the very bottom and that's really  the downside with any of these things because   naturally when you have a lot of  toppings on the very top of it there   it's good for the very top but then as you get  towards the bottom you kind of expect there to   be some form of cheese or something there  that would be kind of nice to have like a   more of a coated look to it there and a feel  and the overall flavor but so far pretty good yeah i'm liking this and i had a feeling i would  considering all the toppings on this but i do have   to say it is really kind of a fun shape and again  let me show that to you there really nice and i   like the fact that they keep the skin on them as  well that's really a nice touch and i think it   really adds to the overall authenticity and it  gives you just a little bit more of a heartiness   to kind of bite into there so the softness of  the potato on the inside a little bit more of   a chew on the outside which is kind of nice and it  soaks up the cheese pretty well which is very rich   a little on the salty side but it really feels  more like a beer cheese but naturally the bacon   really that flavor i think i'm expecting to  kind of jump out more but there's really just   not a lot of bacon on here but the marinated  onions guys lovely situation on that absolutely   alright so one more bite and then we'll  close this one up after the rating but guys   it's a really tasty cheese sauce again the carry  over from oozefest a very nice flavor there   with some grilled onions which is really  a beautiful combination and of course   some smoky bacon on the top you know it was  going to be pretty tasty right i mean come on   alright so no matter how you look at this one  guys lots of cheesy goodness naturally if you're   getting this far into the review already you  already know this is something you're going to   want to give a shot this is really a pretty tasty  side item i do have to say with a very fun shape   and like i said the grilled onions are a major  addition to a very nice beer type cheese on top   here and it's very very heavy on the very top of  it like i should say just wish there was more of   it on the bottom along with maybe just a little  bit more chopped bacon but guys very flavorful   upgrade your fries to new tater scoops at wienerschnitzel well as you guys saw in one of those   first clips in the beginning of this review  there's three different options you can choose   from and naturally if you just want cheese  you've got the double cheese variant there's   obviously a chili cheese variant which i almost  got but considering i did the chili cheese fries   about a month or so ago i wanted to go in on this  variant which actually the grilled onions and the   bacon was very enticing looking and that was the  main reason for that so honestly unless you're not   really into chili at least you've got two other  options to choose from but obviously the grilled   onions and the bacon i think is going to be one of  the most popular besides the chili cheese so guys   not bad on that it really isn't so with that  said i'm gonna have to give the cheesy bacon   tater scoops here at weiner schnitzel a pretty  rock solid 7.7 out of 10 i would definitely kick   this one up above the eight mark if it had just  a little bit more bacon on it it was a little   lacking in that department but the grilled onions  definitely made up for it a very nice rich beer   cheese that this one was coated with and again a  little bit on the bottom i think really would have   set the tone a little bit of cheese that you  ladle in put some of those fries in there and   naturally all the other toppings that would have  been beautiful considering it's $4.39 i'm expecting   just a little bit more in that category otherwise  pretty rock solid with some pretty banging flavor   alright so i got to ask you aside from wanting  to know if you're personally going to be giving   this one a shot if you've got wienerschnitzel in  the area did you think there was enough toppings   on this i mean was it the perfect amount for you  in terms of the cheese maybe the grilled onions   and the bacon was that actually sufficient for  you for the price drop some comments down below   and definitely let me know and with that this  is Ian K closing out another high quality foodie   feature for you here on peep this out reviews  bringing you brand new content
