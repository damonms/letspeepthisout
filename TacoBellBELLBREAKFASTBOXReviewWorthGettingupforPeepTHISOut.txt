 what's going on everyone and welcome or  welcome back to the channel it's Ian K   where today i'm over at taco bell to check  out their latest breakfast promo to see if   it's really worth getting up early for and  being that i just so happen to be up early   right now i'm about to find out so guys stay  tuned because the bell breakfast box is up next   welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty all right so here we go with the bell breakfast  box and i have to say we've got a nice selection   of morning favorites over here at taco bell to  go in on this presentation is looking pretty nice   starting off with the grande toasted breakfast  burrito split in half for ya what this one   consists of is a warm flour tortilla filled with  eggs a three cheese blend normally tomatoes and   your choice of bacon or sausage and i obviously  decided to go with bacon you can get steak for   a small up charge of a dollar but guys let's just  keep it real bacon is where it's at in the morning   and while grande is a little bit of a stretch  for it considering the size it does look pretty   packed but off to the side to go with it we've  got a nice looking hash brown guys fairly crispy   looking and i have to say the size on that is  absolutely oversized it looks pretty nice for   dessert we've got a two pack of their fan favorite  cinnabon delights filled with that makara icing   on the inside guys you gotta love that the name  brand goodness for sure and to top it all off   to wash it all down we've got a medium drink of  your choice and in this case i decided to go with   a regular iced coffee a very lovely situation  and it's definitely looking very inviting so   there you go this is the bell breakfast box  here at taco bell let's peep out this flavor   well i don't know about grande because i've  definitely had bigger breakfast burritos   than this guys but even still it looks very  very toasty and on the inside it is fairly   sizable as you can see here the bacon is pretty  plentiful along with the potatoes and of course   the cheese that's buried in there along with  the fluffy eggs but even still guys grande   i don't know about that but let's just get into  this I'm pretty much gonna take a little taste of   everything here and then we'll rate it for the  overall value at the very end but i'm excited   guys because it's early in the am and i'm not  really an am person so let's just get this party   started guys it's the all-new bell breakfast  box here at taco bell let's peep this out it's tasty though it is just that first bite alone i got a lot of  bacon guys it is very smoky they really packed   this together as you can see this is loaded very  nicely with the cheese with the egg definitely   a lovely situation you know what let me wash it  down with some of that medium iced coffee hang on that really is the wild card i think with this  particular promo guys because guys it's frosty   super delicious and i'm definitely loving the  look of that plenty of cream and sugar on the   inside of this one as well i decided to go  with three and three because they ask you   and guys that really is the perfect  amount for this take it from me seriously   three and three three cream  three sugar pretty banging oh yeah very very tasty all right another  couple of bites on this and then we'll get   into the other goodies real fast here but again  plenty of bacon guys i am totally digging the   amount of bacon in this one it almost feels like a  bacon burrito with all the rest of the ingredients   being the side note to this i'm not complaining  it's still pretty tasty let's keep going in here's some more money shots for you guys and  again i really can't get over how much bacon   i have in this burrito this is pretty much one  of the biggest portions of bacon i've had on a   breakfast burrito yet from taco bell and i have  to say it goes very nicely with the toastiness   on the outside of this if it's a lovely situation  of breakfast goodness and you really can't fade   the fact that the swine is mighty fine on this  and hey being that this is taco bell how can i   not go in on one last bite before we move on  to the next items over here without going in   on some hot sauce and in this case this is  going to prove it to me right now hopefully   we're going to see the fire goodness with a  little bit of this action let's get it ready   i mean you gotta do a little bit of sauce or  something here right let's just give this a go   yes sir hopefully that's staying  focused for you lovely situation   i love the fire sauce over here i mean  nothing against diablo and the other ones   fire is like a good balance across  the board let's just go for it and with all that bacon and the potato to go  with that that definitely works really nice   yeah that is very very tasty another swig don't sleep on the iced coffee and literally  don't sleep period on this box so far guys it is   really good nice stuff all around okay let's go  in on this here lemme break this towards you take   a look this feels very oily right now guys very  oily and very greasy and i have a feeling it's   going to i can feel it on my fingers it's like  falling apart right now and man the tray that   i'm using right now is kind of wet underneath  these napkins it's crazy let's give it a shot oh yeah no can't do this one any  more than that bite crazy oil on this   i think this one was sitting too long on the  inside honestly it looks like it could have   gone just a little bit longer but they should have  drained it just a little bit more it's very fresh   that could be the reason why i'm doing this really  early in the morning but still very very oily on   that so no bueno on the hash brown mcdonald's is  still worth that as far as i'm concerned it's nice   that they throw this into the box but at the same  time crazy oily all right let's go for this one to   round it out and obviously the cinnamon delights  are a banging situation over here just a lovely   combination of name brand cinnabon goodness done  the taco bell way let's get into this one and   if you're wondering yes this does feel a little  oily in my fingers right now as well let's do it oh it makes me want to get a real cinnabon  every time i have these these are really good   and take a look at that action on the inside right  there love it that cream goodness mmm how do you   pronounce it is it makara makara whatever it is  it's cinnabon name brand goodness and it's banging oh man it's worth it just for this it really is  guys take a look at that plenty of creamy action   and definitely a banging situation and of  course it goes amazing with iced coffee   even if you get the cinnabon delight version of  this it's a small up charge here in southern cali   it's like 40 cents not bad regularized coffee  is all you really need because you have the   combination of this together so if you don't want  to spend the extra 40 cents with inflation going   crazy right now still this is a pretty nice combo  one more bite we'll close this one out hang on hmm well if you're down with the breakfast over  here at taco bell or even if you're mildly   interested in it i have to say this five dollar  box is the way to go by far because considering   the grande toasted breakfast burritos are about  four bucks on their own here in southern cali   it's a no-brainer to go for this and considering  what you're getting a little bit of everything   really i mean along with dessert and then the iced  coffee you can choose if that's not really a thing   you can always go with a soft drink naturally  guys the value is high and what you're getting   is fairly sizable even though the grande name  is just a little bit of a stretch just a little   and given that you do have the option to go in on  the sausage version of this one outside of bacon   for no extra charge that's actually a very good  deal but if you're curious about the steak variant   i actually reviewed that a while back take a  look at that review jumping up on your screen here   right now for the details on that guys it's nice  to have the option but like i said bacon is where   it's at as far as i'm concerned in the morning or  sausage if you're down with that as well all right   so with all that said i'm gonna have to give the  bell breakfast box here at taco bell the obvious   10 out of 10 like i said the value was pretty  high on this guys considering the burrito and the   drink alone are pretty much the five dollar price  point you're pretty much getting dessert and the   extra hash brown thrown in for good measure the  quality is pretty decent and like i said if you   go with bacon that's really the way to go the  version i had was packed with the goods and i   was down without for sure an easy recommendation  if you can get up early and even though i'm not   really a morning person like i said i would pretty  much get up to do this again it was pretty fun   all right so two questions first and foremost  drop some comments down below are you down with   taco bell breakfast because i'd venture to guess  if you've made it this far into the review you   probably are and second do you agree with my  assessment with this one is this worth five   dollars for you drop those comments down below and  definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K   closing out another high quality foodie feature  for you here on peep this out reviews bringing   you brand new content every single week here on my  channel so while you stay tuned for that next review coming   real soon in the meantime stay frosty yes sir some  pretty tasty breakfast goodness over here at taco   bell with this one but as tasty as this was and  believe me it was i think you know that by now   it's time for me to get back to bed  alright everyone until next time   i'll talk to you soon hey thanks for checking  out another one of my reviews but just in case   you didn't see the one before this one you can  find it right up over here along with what i   think youtube's gonna recommend for you to  check out as well as always i
