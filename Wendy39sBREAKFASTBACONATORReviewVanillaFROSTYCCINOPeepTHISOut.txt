with the breakfast Baconator and guys the smell in the car is definitely breakfast and I love it this is really really a nice combination of goodness here underneath a very soft looking bun and I'll just confirm it for you it definitely is let's pop it and take a look underneath looks like we've got some of that Swiss cheese sauce action right there of course plenty of applewood smoked bacon a double portion of it I believe here we've got double the American cheese we've got a cracked egg there's a sausage patty on the bottom see if I can try and separate the egg just a little bit for you it is definitely made fresh it's very hot lots of gooey cheese the bacon goodness and again that grilled sausage on the very bottom as well looks almost like a beef patty but very very lovely situation there so let's not waste any more time with this one guys I'm very excited to give this one a go which the breakfast Baconator brand-new as part of a national breakfast menu here at Wendy's let's peep out this flavor alright let me just say first thing I am definitely not a morning person I mean it really takes a lot for me to get up in the morning to go for breakfast but when I saw that when he was finally launching a national breakfast menu of course I was more than interested because guys it's Wendy's I was very curious to see what they were gonna offer and so far in the presentation Department I am definitely not disappointed this does look pretty great so guys let's not waste any more time but real quick and like always you guys are fans of high quality delicious looking food reviews make sure to hit that subscribe button down below and don't forget to tap the Bell icon so you could be notified as soon as brand new content drops every week here we go the breakfast Baconator brand new here at Wendy's let's do it oh whoa hang on alright so for those of you have been watching my channel for a while I think most of you know I'm not really a super fan of breakfast sausage I mean I love bacon obviously and this is already singing that department which I'm gonna get to in a second but guys the breakfast sausage on this is definitely super super flavorful the spicing that it's got it's not hot at all but it's super flavorful and rich all the cheese the Swiss cheese combination with the American cheese is crazy that cracked egg on this along with the fact that it's freshly made on top of it is insane right now very very flavorful and man this is really super delicious as you guys are seeing in the close ups it looks really really great I mean what can I say the flavor is matching it so far let's go for another bite I'll give you another close-up we're keeping it going guys this is really good mmm Wow well there it is in all its cross-section glory guys a very lovely situation of a freshly made breakfast Baconator and I gotta say again that breakfast sausage on the bottom was really nice the grilled flavor is coming through it's not greasy the flavor is on point but that's Swiss cheese and the regular American cheese combo takes this one into overdrive along with that applewood smoked bacon just a lovely situation overall and as you may have heard in the drive-thru sequence in the beginning of this review you can actually swap out the sausage patty for a beef that would be a recommendation to try in the near future I have a feeling guys because a true breakfast burger this would be amazing right now with the fresh beef everything that Wendy's is known for but with that Swiss cheese sauce forget it the flavor of that one alone I'm telling you right now this needs to be on a regular burger in general I can only imagine the combination of that 100% of fresh beef along with that cracked egg the Swiss cheese sauce and of course all the other melted goodies the applewood smoked bacon I can go on and on and on with this guy's but you already know the breakfast Baconator is definitely bomb lemme go for one more bite with this one we'll wrap it up with the rating and guys you already know you're gonna give this a shot I'm super glad that I'm doing this right now let's keep it going all right let me 360 this one for you guys I'm really impressed with the quality of the sausage on this one been considering I'm not a fan of breakfast sausage like I've been saying I'm so impressed with the overall flavor the light sweetness the spices that it's got in it it's just very flavorful and obviously all the are the goodness here the fresh cracked egg the cheese the bacon it really is a lovely combination so the breakfast Baconator is the truth and definitely an awesome sandwich to debut as part of the breakfast menu here at Wendy's just awesome stuff that's incredible so given the fact that the perception of breakfast sausage is definitely upgraded for me over here thanks to Wendy's I'm gonna have to give the breakfast Baconator a rock-solid 10 out of 10 guys the flavor was off the chart I didn't think I was gonna like a sausage sandwich technically with all the other bacon and all the other goodness on there I'm really loving the protein choice with that and I'm really thankful that it's not greasy that grilled flavor comes through really beautifully and that Swiss cheese sauce with an American cheese combo it's gonna send you into the stratosphere guys it's really good flavor-wise and again applewood smoked bacon wendy's is known for that the crispiness is on point what is not to like about that right I mean seriously but hey I'm sure you've got your opinion so what do you personally think drop some comments down below are you excited for the breakfast menu here at Wendy's and if you are how excited are you to give the breakfast Baconator a shot after what you've just seen right now got those comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K closing out another episode of peep this out bringing you brand new content every single week here on my channel so while you stay tuned for that next review coming real soon in the meantime stay frosty and hey let's not forget about that frosty ccino this may look like any other type of iced coffee you've ever seen but in Wendy's case we've got a mixture of cold brew along with either your choice of chocolate or vanilla frosty creamer yeah we're getting into this right now all right now this one is completely fitting guys I mean how could I not stay frosty with a frosty ccino and the fact that I love Frosty's in general and cold brew is my favorite type of coffee let's get into this one oh whoa hang on hang on that is creamy that is creamy really smooth rich cold brew you can tell this was definitely steeped for like the minimum 12 hours like they recommend it tastes amazing it's smooth its rich mmm little hints of that vanilla frosty I mean it's not strong but the overall flavor of the cold brew itself with the cream is insane a little light sweetness as well that vanilla is lovely guys this is really good hmm I'm not gonna give us a rating because I got this for free naturally but keep in mind I'm gonna get this again I'll let that speak for itself this is easily worth your time I love the name frosty ccino it's definitely one of the names sakes here in my channel thankfully because of stay frosty anyway so I'm diggin that not that I'm saying Wendy's chose the name for that reason that would be cool but I got to say guys very delicious on this one it's awesome mmm all right I'm gonna finish this I'm gonna have the rest of that breakfast Baconator you jump over
