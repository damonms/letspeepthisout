 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty what's going on everyone it's Ian K back again  with another high quality foodie feature for you   here on peep this out reviews this time on over  at popeyes because to the surprise of no one we've   got yet another variation of their popular fried  shrimp to check out and not only is it supposed to   be wicked apparently it's supposed to be as they  put it twisty that's how they're advertising it   feast your eyes on the wicked shrimp and i gotta  say we've got another box of fried goodness on   our hands here this is looking pretty tasty  so what we've got here is 14 pieces of their   popular popcorn chicken deep fried to a crispy  golden brown but before that they've actually   been infused with a much higher level of spice  so i'm expecting this to be a little bit heated   off to the side we've got the usual cajun fries  you obviously have your choice of side I chose the   fries this time you've got the usual biscuit to go  with and for dipping this is going to be the wild   card feast your eyes on the smoky garlic tartar  sauce and it's always a good thing when this is   actually served out individually instead of the  prepackaged containers i have a feeling this is   going to be pretty tasty so guys let's not waste  any more time it's the quote-unquote twisty wicked   shrimp here at popeye's let's peep out this flavor  well i don't know about wicked just yet much less   twisty i have no idea what that actually means but  i can tell you right now my car is lit up with the   fried goodness that is absolutely apparent guys  let me just give you a look inside the box here   again you can't beat the goodness that popeyes has  it's always a box of fried goodness for five bucks   it's actually a lovely situation and again with  the wicked name i'm expecting some heat here and   honestly i think you guys are as well but before  i get started and like always if you guys are fans   of high quality delicious looking food reviews  make sure to hit that subscribe button down below   and don't forget to tap that bell icon so  you can be notified as soon as brand new   content drops every week alright i've had the  popcorn shrimp a bunch of times over here and i   can tell you there is no difference compared  to what that actually has been in the past   and what this looks like right now but  let's see what the spice level is here   it's the quote-unquote twisty wicked  shrimp here at popeyes let's do it crunchy fried no heat i'm not getting anything  hang on i mean it's good maybe a little sizzle   but there is nothing to this man i love the fried  outer coating on this i don't know if twisty means   my taste buds are going to be twisted in flavor  overload right now like a mouthgasm ridiculous   but i'm not really feeling what this is supposed  to be so far if there's some extra heat in this   it looks like there was peppers in the  advertisement on the poster try it again it's just a little bit of light smokiness  with a slight sizzle but nothing   to really warrant the wicked name i mean this  is marketing gold for what it is right i mean   14 pieces of popcorn a side in a biscuit five  bucks it's not bad right but i am not feeling   what this heat is supposed to be on this right now  it's a little bit of a sizzle it's kind of like a   tease actually so they should call this like the  teasing wicked shrimp here at popeyes because i've   actually had a lot hotter in the past this is not  really hot like at all i mean naturally this stuff   is pre-marinated and then fried in store so i'm  expecting some of it to burn off but you know what   being one of the kings in the chicken game right  now you'd expect this to kind of be perfected by   this point right i mean if it has the name like  wicked shrimp it's got to be more than just the   marketing there's got to be some more heat  with this and so far i'm just not getting it   but i like it because the fried  coating is good it's classic popeyes   nothing alright so it is what it is i mean it's  still a good value for five bucks the quality is   pretty tasty it's popeyes but the real wild card  like i said in the initial close-up is gonna   be this guy right over here the smoky garlic  tartar sauce so oh yeah there's heavy garlic   on this and that tartar smells very rich really  really nice let me grab a good one here for you   let's go for this little guy right here all  right here we go take a look it is thick   definitely about an ounce or so that they  have in each of these little solo cups here   let's give this a go here nice and creamy  though i gotta admit it smells great already crazy rich garlic on this oh the  garlic actually has some bite to it wow   that's actually pretty amazing guys hopefully  it's not going to be too contrasty to kind of   blow it out there apparently well maybe  a little bit focus focus but tasty this feels more like a garlic spread than  tartar sauce i'm not really getting too much   tartar with this but man this is pretty  good let's go for a few more dips of this   like i said i don't really know the wicked  name here it's mostly the heat that's inside   the smoky garlic here that's what's giving it  but you'd expect it to be at least a little   bit in the shrimp a little bit more to kind of  pair up with this and one two punch there you go it's really good but misleading on the heat but i  got to say guys man i'd want to use that on some   other types of food this is really really good  heavy garlic probably some of the most garlic   i've ever had of popeyes and naturally because  they dole this out into these solo cups not   pre-packaged that's a good thing so let's go for  one more of these and we'll call it a day because   it's the popcorn shrimp i've had this a million  times here at popeyes take a look at the playlist   popping up on your screen here right now there's  a multitude of reviews i've done in the past   no difference whatsoever just supposedly a little  bit more heat with this particular one to go with   let me go for one more here and we'll give you  one more wrap-up scene here but man so far it's a   little disappointing but tasty but again 14 pieces  five bucks you get the side you get the biscuit   not a bad deal it's popeyes they  do this every month it's decent   man this garlic is banging i'm so glad i  got two of these right now i got to tell you   so good yeah that's definitely a highlight for  sure again i'm so glad i got a couple of those   and just also to let you guys know if really 14  pieces of shrimp is not really your thing you can   actually get some chicken to go with naturally  whenever popeyes has a fried shrimp combo   they always do like a surf and turf you can still  get the five dollar promo but they have the amount   of shrimp and then i think it's like three tenders  to go with there so pretty solid for what that is   but guys a little disappointing in the name  this is really something that i would expect to   see for halloween um at least there they've had  the wicked good deal in the past so i'm really   kind of surprised they didn't do anything  this year this seems like it's a little late   but for what this is like i said the coating  nice it's really crispy fried goodness that   popeyes is known for but the heat that it's  supposed to have is not delivering on the name   and what twisty really means if you guys  know drop that in the comments down below   i have no idea what that means with this but  even still the main reason i probably want to   get this is to give that smokey garlic  tartar sauce a shot it absolutely rocks well you got me on this one popeyes even though  we're a few days past halloween now this is still   a treat even though i feel like i was tricked a  little bit right now guys this really is pretty   solid for what it is but the heat level is  just not there i mean the wicked name you're   expecting it to be something a little bit more  elevated and when i was told specifically it's   an elevated amount of spice that's what i was  kind of expecting naturally i think most of it   is coming from that smoky garlic tartar sauce  that is easily the reason to give this a shot   i'd love to dip some chicken into that and i  think i may have to do that off camera it is   really really worth your time it really is so with  that said i'm going to have to get what they're   calling twisty quote unquote wicked shrimp here at  popeyes just an okay 7 out of 10 this is not   going to reinvent what you've already known from  popeyes to have over the years guys it's really   the same exact thing but with the heat level  being supposedly higher that is where it falls   right there everything else is still pretty tasty  and naturally what you're getting with that sauce   the combination is what makes that i just wish it  was just a little bit more in terms of the heat   just to deliver on the wicked name just at the  very least okay so if you've made it this far   into the review i have a feeling you're going  to be going to give this a shot either way drop   some comments down below let me know what you  thought of this one after you gave it a shot and   what were your thoughts on that smoky garlic  tartar sauce was that like the jam or what i   mean it was really good at least i thought so and  with that this is Ian K closing out another high   quality foodie feature for you here on peep this  out reviews bringing you brand new content every   single week here on
