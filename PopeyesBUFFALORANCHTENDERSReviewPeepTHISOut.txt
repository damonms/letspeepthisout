 hey everyone its Ian K for peep this out reviews this time over at Popeye's take a look at their latest promo which looks to be something new well sort of so stay tuned because the Buffalo ranch tenders are up next welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty alright here we go with the Buffalo ranch tenders here at Popeyes and as expected another delicious looking box of fried goodness this actually looks and smells really really great right now guys starting off with the main star of the show we've got their classic chicken tenders breaded up and fried to a crispy golden-brown but before that they're marinated in Louisiana seasonings all that good stuff and as you can see drizzled on the top is a creamy buffalo sauce it's supposed to deliver some decent amount of heat from what I'm told but it's looking pretty tasty looking really really nice we've got a side of fries here to go with it and the combo is rounded out with a biscuit so for five bucks not too bad at all just on the side here they showed blackened ranch so I decided to go with that as well you can't have too much ranch and it's one of my favorites but this is looking really good three tenders and a pretty generous amount of that buffalo drizzle there looking really really tasty so let's see if this one's gonna deliver it's the new buffalo ranch tenders here at Popeyes let's peep out this flavor all right so correct me if I'm wrong is this like a thing now to basically drizzle sauce on chicken tenders and market it as quote-unquote new I mean that's pretty much something that I think people can do on their own just by dipping chicken into sauces but I guess technically it is set up for you so what can you do well actually in Popeyes case market it as new so that's what we've got right now guys take a look at the buffalo chicken tenders one more time it's not a bad promo for what you get for five bucks like normal three tenders fries and a biscuit is definitely a cool thing and actually with that quote-unquote new aspect of this here with the Buffalo not bad whatsoever so before I get into this and like always if you guys are fans of high quality delicious

pick up one of these real quick and we'll give you another fast close up before I bite into this but guys looking nice glistening in the Sun right there as you can see drizzled with that Buffalo goodness now this was described as being like a creamy type of heat so let's see if it does just that let's give it a shot you know what Wow okay for those of you who don't know the same company that owns Popeyes also owns Burger King this ranch the creaminess of it is very very similar to that the consistency is nice on it it's glistening in the Sun for you there as well the creaminess is on point the heat is kind of coming up in the background just a bit but guys I have to admit this is really reminding me of BK's buffalo sauce just not a lot of it because I do actually prefer that over all the other ones out there just because of the creamy consistency and how thick it is but this flavor wise is very similar let's keep going yeah straight out you'd be hard-pressed to tell me this was not the buffalo sauce from BK on these tenders right now and just so you guys know I know that Sun is kind of blowing it out let me pull it back to slightly right there the chicken itself fairly juicy a little thin on this particular one but the crispiness is on point and definitely a Popeyes situation that you already know in love that heat is exactly the same from BK the way to resonating in the back you know technically I see what they're going for with this a little bit of creamy heat the fact that it has a ranch in it the thickness of the consistency it's just enough to let you know that the heat is there with some of that creamy ranch action to go with so it's nice nothing earth-shattering nothing revolutionary I'm not reinventing the wheel with this but it is pretty tasty let's go for one more bite and we're definitely going for a little dip of the blackened ranch because guys like I said you can never have too much ranch they go hand in hand with chicken tenders hang on mm-hmm all right so this ranch has already got some spices all on its own naturally there it's really good over here and I got to admit going with a little bit of extra Buffalo can't be a bad thing let's give us a go and naturally since I can dip it myself of course we've got more of that goodness on here let's do it hmm that's the ticket right there and the creamy Buffalo coming up with that slight heat cool creaminess of the blackened ranch too mmm I see why they market this on the poster with blackened ranch it goes amazingly well with the Buffalo and like I said the creaminess of that is there already a little bit of the heat from the Buffalo but I'm telling you I'd be really surprised if I didn't find out this was BK's buffalo sauce actually all over these chicken tenders right now and guys its tasty don't get me wrong but again nothing earth-shattering mm-hmm all right so just around this one out the versions of these tenders I've got today are a little on the thin side but the crispiness is on point and as you can see a very decent amount of that Buffalo goodness in there I only wish they were actually coated just a little bit more around that would be really nice to kind of drench them slightly but for advertising purposes you're just getting that drizzle on top and you get your dipping sauce of choice but a nice combination either way for five bucks with fries or your choice of side and a biscuit so decent stuff I would recommend it and guys it's the fried goodness over at Popeyes you know you're gonna dig it all right so innovation wise that's not gonna win any awards guys like I said Buffalo and chicken goes hand-in-hand just having it drizzled on your chicken is a nice thing to have naturally just because of the prep but for what it is it's really not gonna be anything more than the mid-range in terms of innovation because guys I think it's expected when people get Fried Chicken it's usually ranch Buffalo is really one of the more popular ones to go with so I can see why they chose that but at the end of the day it's still fried crispy goodness from Popeyes and the quality is solid so overall I'm gonna have to give the buffalo ranch tenders over here at Popeyes just an OK 7 out of 10 it drops down a few pegs strictly because of the innovation aspect of it but it's tasty it's delicious it's pretty much everything I've had in the past this time just with some buffalo sauce but I'm telling you it is BK's buffalo sauce it really really tastes exactly the same way and I'm diggin that don't get me wrong it's good I'd probably rock this one again but again 7 out of 10 pretty much it alright so now the obvious question is this one gonna be it for you right now do me a quick favor drop some comments down below is Buffalo your sauce of choice when it comes to fried chicken or chicken tenders in general or is something else more your speed drop those comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K closing out another episode of peep this out bringing you brand new content every single week here on my channel so while you stay tuned for that next review coming soon in the meantime stay frosty this one's definitely tasty Popeyes don't get me wrong but if I can put a suggestion in that box for you I'd probably recommend maybe next time around try some different shapes or something with a different theme maybe like asteroid chicken pieces of chicken that look like a meteor with some type of glitter or something like that you guys have that capability with the 24-karat wings that I reviewed a while back this would actually be a really really nice addition if you actually change the shape of it and do something different that's all I'm asking alright everyone until next time I'll talk to you soon but hey real quick before you go and just in case you haven't already take a look at the last review that I put out right up over here along but I think YouTube's gonna recommend for you to check out as well as always I think you'll find something the like in both of them and I'll definitely catch ya in the next one see ya
