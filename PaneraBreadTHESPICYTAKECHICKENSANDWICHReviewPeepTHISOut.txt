 what's going on everyone and welcome or  welcome back to the channel it's Ian K   where today i'm over at panera this time to  check out the spicy variant of their all-new   chef's chicken sandwiches that's right and  you already know so stay tuned because the   spicy take chicken sandwich is up next welcome  to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty well this is already looking and smelling  pretty awesome guys feast your eyes on the   spicy take chicken sandwich one of the  chef's chicken sandwich selections over   here at panera and i got to say guys there  is plenty of buffalo sauce going on with   this sandwich right now let's break this  one on down this is looking really great   all right so what's supposed to be bursting with  flavor according to the box this comes in is the   spicy take chicken sandwich guys and already we're  being greeted by a very nice looking brioche roll   looking very very fresh let's pop it and take  a look underneath and already we're being set   off with a fairly decent amount of garlic aioli  mixed up with some buffalo sauce and as we pan   down you're going to find that combination on top  of a pan seared chicken breast it looks to be a   very nice piece of hormone-free chicken guys  that's covering this bun very very nicely and   apparently it's pan-seared on top of it again so  that's going to give you some added extra flavor   underneath it we're supposed to have a whole bunch  of spicy pickle chips but it looks like what i've   got here is spicy pickle crumbs i mean there's a  lot of them on there guys but it looks like it's   more of the coating than the actual pickle chips  but as you can see a fairly decent amount of that   garlic aioli as well and more buffalo sauce to  go with but guys again coming back to that pan   seared chicken it's looking pretty fantastic  and the aroma is definitely lighting up my car   beautifully so let's not waste any more time on  this one this is the all new spicy take chicken   sandwich here at panera bread let's peep out  this flavor yeah it's just a little disheartening   considering all the crumbs i have on the bottom  of this chicken sandwich but considering how much   garlic aioli and buffalo sauce is all over this  guys i'm not really minding that too much let's   just hope that what is there on the bottom is  gonna deliver the goods because the flavor i   can tell you is hopefully gonna be there with all  the sauce this has so guys one last time before we   get into it it's the spicy take chicken sandwich  over here at panera bread let's peep this out very rich yeah this is a very heavily sauced  up situation guys and as i'm looking at this   right now the chicken breast itself and  i might as well just show it to you is   definitely on the drier side as white meat  tends to be depending upon how it's prepared   but there is so much buffalo sauce and garlic  aioli adding so much rich flavor to this i didn't   even really get into this pickle crumbs so to  speak on the bottom but guys so far i am digging   what i've got here right now that combination of  the aioli and buffalo banging let's keep going in yeah now there's a better shot for you and i  definitely got some more of those spicy pickle   chips in that second bite guys and i gotta say  the flavor is very very nice there's definitely   more crumbs than actual pickle flavor but i am  getting a light hint of it in the background   but the combination of the garlic aioli and that  buffalo sauce goes beautifully with this chicken   here right now a solid piece of white meat as  you can see while it's a little on the dry side   the sauce is more than making up for it and i  guess that's the main reason it's there right   because guys i got to tell you considering the  experience i had recently with the signature take   version of this sandwich which you're probably  seeing jumping up on your screen here right now   this is infinitely the better way to go by far  i would recommend going in on the spicy variant   it's not really overly spicy at all maybe just a  little sizzle in the background but the quality   is definitely singing on this one the only thing  that i'm kind of thinking about again just like   the last time is the fact that this is $12 guys  it's not really worth the price point for $12   but it's very rich and very flavorful let's  keep going in for a couple more pretty nice you know as i'm getting further into this one and  just like the sandwich before that signature take   it's not so much tall of a sandwich as it is wide  and i got to say guys even though it's not really   there on the size department because of the  height the wideness that it's got here on the   bite that you're getting into is very hearty and  again the substantial flavor profile with that   garlic aioli and the buffalo sauce is an amazing  deal i only wish i had some more thicker pieces   of the spicy pickle chips on the very bottom guys  because i think that really would have added so   much more to it and maybe kind of put a little  bit of the band-aid in terms of what i've got   on my wallet right now because of the cost but  at the same time guys the quality is very nice   and again the hormone-free chicken really tastes  pretty fantastic very decent-sized filet i only   wish like i said it was maybe half the price or  maybe three quarters of the price of what i paid   and again more of the spicy pickle chips because  they definitely are adding something what i do   have here on top of the sauces pretty cool all  right so let's go for one more bite on this one   before we wrap the review up with the rating  coming up next but guys like i said this is the   sandwich you want to start out with i would not  recommend going with the signature variant again   it really comes down to all those sauces  the buffalo action if you're not really   big on heat you're not going to mind this one  too much it's just a little bit of a sizzle   but guys it's so flavorful really really tasty  stuff one more bite we'll close it out hang on all right so let's go around the world with  this one guys and again very very lovely in   the sauce department this is really very well  done i'm kind of glad they're using garlic aioli   instead of ranch which you typically see with some  buffalo sandwiches like this but the thickness is   very much similar to that because guys it really  resembles ranch if you ask me when you're biting   into this you can really feel it it's a thick type  of sauce with that combo with the garlic goodness   there but again the antibiotic-free chicken i got  to say a lovely situation but i only wish i had   more of those pickle chips on the very bottom  but still very delicious on this all right so   with that said i'm gonna have to give the spicy  variant of these all new chefs chicken sandwiches   here at panera a pretty awesome 8 out of 10  and i'm not gonna go much higher than that because   guys like i said what's really killing this one  is the price point twelve dollars for that is way   over the top but considering the flavor profile i  to say guys it is worth checking out at least one   time just make sure you get more of the spicy  pickle chips because i gotta say the snap that   those added just a little bit on the bottom and  it was more of the crumbly crunchies that i had   because they were crumbs really goes nice in terms  of the overall texture and just the difference in   the flavor profile but guys delicious across the  board and again the combination of the garlic   aioli and that buffalo a banging situation worth  checking out at least once but be prepared your   wallet's gonna get hurt just a little bit all  right so do me a quick favor if you ventured   over into the dark side and overpaid for both of  these chicken sandwiches like i have right now do   me a favor and drop some comments down below let  me know which one is your favorite out of the two   and actually how much would you actually think  that they're worth now that i think about it   how much would you pay for one of these sandwiches  and really feel okay about it drop those comments   down below and definitely let me know and  with that this is Ian K closing out another   high quality foodie feature for you here on peep  this out reviews bringing you brand new content   every single week here on my channel so while you stay  tuned for that next review coming real soon in the   meantime stay frosty yes sir definitely bursting  with flavor on this sandwich for sure panera but i   have a feeling some of my 12 dollars actually went  to paying for the sleeve that it comes in just   saying all right guys until next time i'll talk  to you soon hey
