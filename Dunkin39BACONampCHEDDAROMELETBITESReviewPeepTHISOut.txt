 hey everyone welcome back to another high quality  foodie feature for you here in the channel where   this morning i'm over at dunkin to check out a  little portable omelette action on the go that's   right and as you already know it's their new  omelet bites so stay tuned because they're up next   welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty so let's get it cracking with the all-new omelet  bites here at dunkin and already i'm getting vibes   of bagel bites with this one guys you can't tell  me this doesn't look like 2 mini bagels but   still the presentation is pretty cool looking  on these all right so it looks like what we've   got here is a couple of eggs very fluffy like  and again very bagel-like at the same time and   with this variant being the bacon cheddar that  i'm checking out it looks like it's got bits of   bacon all throughout the inside of this one as  well as a little bit of cheddar cheese action   and again with the presentation looking very  bagel-like to me it's really playing with my   head right now but i do have to say the aroma  is kicking with eggs big time i'm definitely   digging that for sure all right so let's get into  these it's the omelet bites over here at dunkin   let's peep out this flavor yes sir pretty cool  presentation indeed along with a little tray   that they come in here i'm really digging this  here this really looks very different and again   very bagel bite-like if you ask me in terms of the  way that this looks but the aroma like i said is   screaming eggs maybe a little bit of smoked bacon  in the air as well let me see if i can try and cut   one of these here just a little bit and they  are pretty dense from what i'm seeing already   here guys but oh yeah there we go that actually  is looking pretty nice little bits of bacon all   throughout the inside of this there and again the  nice little thick consistency on this one as well   it almost feels like a thick donut when you're  cutting into this but very nice let's give this   a shot guys it's the bacon cheddar variant of the  all-new omelet bites here at dunkin let's do it wow dense and thick on that  ooh the cheddar is good   yeah definitely very cheesy on this and actually  you can really kind of feel the denseness all   throughout guys like i said that's going to be  the theme with this one because it is really   thick packed with protein on this there's really  nothing carb-like in this at all it's pretty much   eggs cheese and some bacon bits but man the  thickness is on point with this pretty good   hmm wow cheesy action these are really really  rich very surprising right now and again the   presentation of that bagel action is really nice  i'm really digging the way that these are formed   why they made them like that with the hole in the  middle i don't know but you know what it's really   playing with my head right now and i like it it's  really tasty let's go for another one on this   really digging the consistency of this very nice  and again made just like all the other stuff   in there baked airfryer type of contraption they  have on the inside there but it gets the job done   but i gotta say guys the richness of the cheddar  is really standing out on this i am totally   digging it you know i got to say when i initially  saw these i wasn't sure about the size of this in   particular i mean naturally the size is pretty  decent when you see them up close and in person   but initially you don't really know what you're  going to be getting and at $4.60 here in southern   cali i was hoping they were going to be pretty  decent but thankfully the denseness is really i   think justifying the price point and i'm really  digging the overall flavor you can really taste   the smokiness of that bacon as well as the cheese  it's pretty thick all throughout guys pretty tasty   oh yeah definitely all right so here's what i've  got left on this one that i'm working on here   and as you can see guys a very nice amount of  denseness on this one here it is really pretty   solid and very hearty one of these i think will  satisfy pretty nicely but i'm really digging the   overall flavors of everything combined together  on this one just a beautiful situation with this   all right hopefully that last shot stayed in  focus as much as it possibly could because i   wanted to give you a nice up close and personal  shot once again on exactly what i'm working with   here guys again very impressed with the  overall denseness of this and again the   quality of the cheese and the bacon the  smokiness is pretty solid so let me go   for this one last bite we'll wrap the review  up with the rating coming up next but guys   a pretty nice alternative to what's out there  breakfast wise and i think one of the best   things dunkin has had in a very long time for  breakfast not bad let's go for one last bite   is it a bagel is it an egg is it an egg bagel  you tell me guys because this really kind of   looks like a bagel to me but even still aside from  the shape it definitely delivers in terms of the   overall flavor like i said the cheese is very rich  the bacon bits the smokiness that i'm getting from   it as well is very nice and again one last time  the denseness for it is definitely on point super   delicious on this one and an easy recommendation  easily all right so with that said i'm gonna have   to give the all-new omelet bites at least the  bacon cheddar variant over here at dunkin are   pretty rock solid 9 out of 10 guys like i said  the flavor is very rich on this one and i venture   to guess this is one of the most flavorful type of  breakfast items they've had on the menu over here   and i gotta say it definitely satisfies especially  if you're watching carbs and that type of thing   this is definitely a good alternative i mean it's  just eggs cheese and bacon and the quality is off   the chart at least in terms of what you're going  to get for $4.60 like i said a little bit on the   price point a little bit up there but at the same  time it delivers on flavor it delivers on taste   and that's what you definitely want all right so  do me a quick favor drop some comments down below   let me know if you've given this bacon cheddar  variant of these omelet bites over here at dunkin   to shot and if you have what did you personally  think did you agree with my assessment of this one   drop those comments down below and definitely let  me know and with that this is Ian K closing out   another high quality foodie feature for you here  on peep
