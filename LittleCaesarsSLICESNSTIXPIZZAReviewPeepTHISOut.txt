 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty pizza pizza what's going on everybody it's Ian K back again with another high quality foodie feature for you here on peep this out reviews this time back at good ol little caesars because it looks like they've got something perfectly suited for some of you indecisive peeps out there that's right feast your eyes on the slices and stix pizza and i gotta say this is looking pretty cool basically a whole pizza split down the middle and it's separated into four pepperoni pizza slices and then they have the other half as eight italian cheese sticks so if you can't decide between pepperoni pizza and italian cheese sticks this is the pizza for you and obviously because it's expected with italian cheese sticks you gotta dip into something right so here we go with the crazy sauce here very popular over little caesars and of course it's the perfect pairing to go with this one here so let's not waste any more time on this one and see if this one's going to deliver it's the all-new slices and stix pizza here at little caesars let's peep out this flavor alright so right off the break this is not necessarily going to be a review of their pepperoni pizza because naturally i've done so many variations of it which you guys can find in the playlist in the upper right hand corner of your display right now for proof of that but when it comes to the cheese sticks of course i wanted to give that a shot and just looking at this guys as you can tell it's a super thin crust so obviously it is what it is price wise you kind of expected it to be for six bucks it's still pretty decent for the size so i'm basically going to be looking at this in terms of the overall concept but before i get into this one and like always if you guys are

every week guys a very cool presentation and like i said if you can choose between pepperoni pizza and cheese sticks obviously you've got a combination of the two what i'm gonna do because i'm curious is i'm gonna lean back in the cut here just a bit because this box is kind of big in the car i'm going to lift up a slice of the pepperoni we'll take a look at the thinness of that i'll get a bite of it real quick and then we'll get into those cheese sticks but as you can see very thin guys it's almost like the extra most bestest thin crust but without all the pepperoni i mean there's a decent amount on here don't get me wrong but it is what it is very very thin and of course all the cheesy goodness let's go for a quick bite real fast it's a trademark little caesars flavor boy really tasty a lot of cheese yeah definitely a lot more cheese than sauce on this guys and i'm actually very much okay with that most of you guys know that i do love cheese and with a cheesy pizza like this there is no shortage of it considering the thinness of the crust it's a nice ratio there the amount of cheese on this is almost as thick as the crust itself so very lovely situation on this one here one more bite yeah tasty yeah really tasty and considering i have literally a bucket of crazy sauce that is a serious size of crazy sauce to go with everything here guys let's go for a dip of that pizza on the inside why not before the cheese sticks let's try it with the pizza real fast mmm it adds that extra pop big time very very vibrant and a very heavily flavored marinara right this it's got some serious pungentness to it in your mouth one more bite why not yeah that's really good yeah i'm really glad there is a decent sized amount of crazy sauce to go with this whole situation here because naturally they want you to go in with the pizza as well as the cheese sticks and there's plenty of it as you can see and speaking of the cheese sticks let's just get to the main event as far as i'm concerned again take a look at the thinness of that there nicely seasoned you can see the basil the italian seasoning right there the cheese looking nice let's go you know what before i even do that let's go for a quick bite i almost got ahead of myself real fast lots of garlic and the italian seasoning the saltiness the cheese that's pretty good and again the cheese to crust ratio not too bad on this guys considering all the cheesy goodness on the inside here this is actually not bad so let's go for a quick dip in the crazy sauce let's give this a go let's take a look as far as i'm concerned this really is the main event let's do it it's as you'd expect it to be really tasty really tasty in fact it's making up for the lack of sauce on this side of the pizza because of the cheese sticks so naturally with the four slices you're gonna get more of the regular marinara but because you've got the crazy sauce action right here this pretty much makes this like a cheese pizza for you but with a little bit of the thin crust to go with guys again this is really more of a cracker it really is but for six bucks you really can't hate on it not too bad at all all right so with one slice and one cheese stick out guys as you can see you get a decent amount of food for six bucks this is really not too bad it really is more of like a sampler platter if anything else and this kind of reminds me of the cuatro believe it or not if you guys haven't seen that review take a look at that playlist again in the upper right hand corner of your display that was actually pretty tasty with those different quadrants with flavors this one obviously just being the pepperoni pizza and the cheese sticks it is what it is a thin crust not bad for what you get here for six bucks and like i said if you're indecisive this is right up your alley guys pretty tasty in general and if you like little caesars you already know this is going to be pretty good for ya pizza pizza well i gotta say the one thing i was really looking forward to trying the most in this particular pizza was the actual cheese sticks now granted i had a feeling it was going to be just a flattened version of the italian cheese bread that i did a while back but for what you're getting for six bucks here not too bad and like i said for a sampler eight breadsticks technically normally something like that would sell for about $3.50 or so now granted the stuff crazy bread you can get right now as well for $3.50 and that's going to be way more satisfying because they're thicker and more cheesier and again that can be found in that playlist in the upper right hand corner i keep coming back to it because i've done so many little caesars reviews you guys have a lot to look forward to if you haven't seen some of those but with this i gotta say guys very tasty and again for six bucks you really can't hate on the price point for what it is pepperoni pizza is kind of the throw away with this thing it could have been just any other topping but obviously pepperoni is super popular i see why they went with it it looks good visually but as it stands not bad for six bucks so basing my rating mostly on the concept for what this is and maybe a little bit of the cheese stick action thrown in for good measure here to boost up the points just a bit i'm gonna have to give the slices n stix pizza here at little caesars a pretty decent 7.5 out of 10 it's nothing earth shattering guys but like i said for six bucks you're getting a cracker style pizza with very little dough but with a decent amount of cheese to go with and again if you're indecisive on what to get this is pretty much a no-brainer for you right now because it gives you the best of both worlds good stuff that little caesars puts together in general with their regular pepperoni pizza as well as their regular cheese sticks minus the dough of course okay now the obvious question at least to me anyway less dough or not are you gonna be giving this one a shot is six bucks a pretty decent price point for what this is drop some comments down below how excited are you to give this version of it a shot and if you've tried the italian cheese bread the standard version the thicker bread how do you think it's going to compare overall to this cracker style goodness and i say goodness because it is guys it tastes pretty good drop some comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K closing out another high quality foodie feature for ya here on peep this out reviews bringing you brand new content every single week here on my channel so while you stay tuned for that next review coming real soon in the meantime stay frosty you know for a little more dough so to speak i can actually see this one beefed up just a little bit further i mean imagine there's standard pizza here with their standard pizza crust naturally a little bit thicker than this along with the regular italian cheese bread that'd be just a little bit more heartier in my opinion little caesars come on i think that should be the next step what do you say alright guys until next time i'll talk to you soon hey thanks for checking out another one of my reviews but just in case you didn't see the one before this one you can find it right up over here alone what i think youtube's gonna recommend for you to check out as well as always i think you'll
