 hey everyone all right when it comes to fast food  chocolate chip cookies there are a ton of options   out there to choose from i mean they're pretty  much everywhere right but very few can actually   lay claim to being freshly baked on top of being  the ultimate so when i saw that pizza hut actually   has got the ultimate chocolate chip cookie let's just say i'm here to put that one to the test that's   right so stay tuned because it's up next welcome  to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty alright so welcome or welcome back to the  channel it's Ian K and as you obviously know by   now guys we're going in on what they're calling  the ultimate chocolate chip cookie over here at   pizza hut my very first time trying this and i  got to say the presentation is looking pretty   cool $6.99 for this a little on the pricey side but  it is definitely sizable and it looks pretty great   all right so very simply what we've got here is  their freshly baked chocolate chip cookie loaded   with semi-sweet chocolate chips and i got to say  guys there is a decent portion of those chips all   throughout this right now and i'm definitely  digging the aroma in my car on top of it and   honestly for seven bucks you would hope it would  be sizeable right and thankfully this is so let me   grab the trusty knife this comes with and we'll  actually cut a piece into this real quick here   it is very very soft very nice indeed all  right there we go a nice little chunk for you   take a look at this here as you can see classic  chocolate chip cookie action guys that is looking   very nice baked very very nicely and you can see  there's actually melted gooey chocolate goodies   all throughout this here right now let's  see if it's truly the ultimate though   here we go the quote-unquote ultimate chocolate  chip cookie here at pizza hut let's do it soft rich i'm getting a mrs fields  vibe from this this is actually   really really good wow nice and buttery on  this one really nice and of course you can   fade the fact that it's freshly baked guys let  me just break a little piece of this off for you   it is very nice indeed you can really tell  freshly baked makes all the difference in the   world stay focused for me there very very nice  in the chocolate department let's keep going in man i wouldn't say ultimate but it's very very  good very decadent in flavor wow really nice yup   it's absolutely baked to perfection i think all  this really needs a little ice cream to go on top   of it guys actually kind of like the p'zookie over  BJ's this is actually really really solid and as   you can see again thickness is not too bad but  plenty of that chocolate goodness on the inside   so let's go for another couple on this one guys  very very tasty i had a feeling it was gonna be   it's a gooey chocolate chip cookie freshly made  how bad could that really be right let's go so good right now so good and since it looks like  i've got one of these chocolate chips here in   the tray all by itself on a little piece that  kind of fell off there as you're going to see   very nice in terms of the size guys i really  dig the amount of chocolate on this right now   and it's really really decadent across the board  adding just the right amount of creaminess overall   and the chocolatey flavor is nice mmm wow that is  really good let's see if i can try and break this   just a little bit towards you very nice very  rich plenty of chocolate chips to go around   and definitely a super decadent dessert  over here pizza hut it's pretty nice all right so this is pretty much a quickie  for me over here at pizza hut because like   i said this is my very first time giving this  one a go and considering i've reviewed all of   the freshly baked chocolate chip cookies from  the other guys most notably the pizza chains   as you're probably seeing cycling through your  screen here right now i've done a few reviews in   the past from the other ones they are most notably  from papa john's from domino's naturally even   little seizures with their cookie dough even  though it doesn't really count it wasn't baked   at the same time the pizza hut variant is pretty  nice so i'm gonna go for one more bite of the   bigger piece we'll give you one last close-up and  of course we're going to wrap the review up with   the rating coming up next but guys again glad  to scratch this one off the bucket list hang on well it's definitely not the ultimate but it's  very very good so with that said if you're a fan   of chocolate chip cookies which i'd venture to guess  you are if you've made it this far into the review   this is absolutely an awesome treat to go in on  especially for $6.99 or you can pair it up with   something on their value menu and actually get it  for six bucks with something else this is actually   very very nicely done and the flavor definitely on  point absolutely okay so with that said i'm gonna   have to give the quote-unquote ultimate chocolate  chip cookie here at pizza hut a pretty decent   8.2 out of 10.it definitely gets a couple of extra  points above normal guys because naturally the   size is pretty awesome the freshly baked goodness  absolutely delivers and the semi-sweet goodness   that i'm getting from those chocolate chips  absolutely primo and again considering the size of   it that's where i think it's ultimate because it  is definitely an oversized chocolate chip cookie   that's probably what i would have called this  one the oversized chocolate chip cookie not   the ultimate chocolate chip cookie but i see  what you do in there pizza hut it's marketing   at the same time very delicious on this one  and i would easily rock it again pretty tasty   all right so like i said earlier in the review  this is my first time giving this one a shot but   if you've actually had this one in the past  over here at pizza hut or even more recently   drop some comments down below let me know what  you thought of it is it one of your favorite   things to get for dessert over here outside of  the other dessert options they have on the menu   drop those comments down below and definitely  let me know and with that this is Ian K closing   out another high quality foodie feature for  you here on peep this out reviews bringing   you brand new content every single week here  on my channel so while you stay tuned for that next review   coming real soon in the meantime stay frosty yeah  definitely not the ultimate on this one pizza hut   but still very very tasty like i said earlier i  would definitely rock this one again pretty good   all right everyone until next time i'll talk to  you soon hey thanks for checking out another one   of my reviews but just in case you didn't see the  one before this one you can find it right up over   here along what i think youtube's gonna recommend  for you to check out as well as always i think   you'll find something like
