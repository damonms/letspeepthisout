their all-new hand-breaded  chicken that's right you already know what   it is it's the hot honey hand breaded chicken  sandwich so stay tuned because it's up next   welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty so here we go with the hot honey hand breaded  chicken sandwich here at carl's jr and already   guys we are in for a very sticky situation here it  looks like there is plenty of hot honey sauce on   this and i gotta say this is looking pretty tasty  already so let's pop the top of the brioche style   bun and take a look underneath and it looks like  no shortage of said hot honey sauce on the top of   this one guys looking pretty nice and looking  down below even further there is more of that   good stuff in addition to some crispy bacon and  some swiss cheese as well looking pretty nice   underneath that it looks like we have the other  star of the show besides the hot honey sauce the   hand breaded white meat chicken filet guys dusted  in southern spices buttermilk goodness and fried   to a crispy golden brown and i gotta say this  is also looking nice and crispy maybe a little   bit more so but it's absolutely drenched in that  hot honey sauce underneath it it looks like the   copious amounts of hot honey sauce continue  there is plenty of sauce on this guys and as   you can see a nice shot of the chicken there  more crispy goodness i have a feeling this is   going to be pretty flavorful it's already looking  pretty dynamite so let's not waste any more time   on this one let me see if i can confirm it for  you this is the all new hot honey hand breaded   chicken sandwich here at carl's jr let's peep out  this flavor all right right off the break i gotta   tell you guys i'm very glad i've got a chicken  sandwich diaper on the back of this one because   they absolutely lit up this hand breaded piece of  chicken here right now this is really looking and   smelling pretty fantastic and there is lots of  goodies in the very back of this wrapper here   right now this is pretty crazy in addition to  me reviewing this in a hundred degree weather   right now i've got a couple of fans going and  let me just tell you guys i am really glad for   a punishment with this one just to be on the  safe side i've got some water as i promised   you guys in case this thing is truly heated but  let me see if i can confirm it for you it looks   great it's the all-new hot honey hand-breaded  chicken sandwich here at carl's jr let's do it mmm sweetness oh oh oh yeah oh yeah  this has got some heat hang on wow this is almost taking me back  to the shake shack hot honey chicken   that i reviewed not that long ago it's  actually very similar to that but man   the bite that i did get with that super flavorful  guys very tender on the chicken and there is   loaded amounts of sauce on this to really add to  that the smokiness of the bacon is pretty awesome   and i gotta say the softness of that brioche  style bun is very nice i haven't really   gotten into the swiss cheese yet but honestly  considering how flavorful the hot honey sauce is   i'm not missing it just yet let's  keep going in it's pretty good oh yeah well as i'm seriously beginning to  sweat here in my car in addition to the heat   of the sandwich here right now i gotta  say this is a very lovely situation the   sweetness of that hot honey sauce is delivering  and the heat is keeping a nice backburn sizzle   on my throat here right now this is going  very nice with everything and actually with   the crispiness of that bacon along with it a very  nice combination the chicken is nice and flavorful   nice and juicy as well yeah i had a feeling this  one was going to be ultra hot in the temperature   department anyway considering it was made pretty  fresh guys and i have to say doing the close-ups   initially my fingers were practically burning  when i was trying to lift all the parts up to   show you guys but i got to say again very  lovely situation this is probably the best   flavor that they've come out with so far  in terms of just the different variations   of the chicken that they've got they've also  got a waffle they've got a biscuit version   available as well during breakfast but i got  to say guys pretty lovely situation for what   i've got here right now very banging in the  flavor department and the heat is pretty solid   all right let's go for a couple more bites on this  real quick because i am beginning to melt but in   the best most possible way because the flavor of  this is just banging right now let's keep going in here's an even better cross-section shot so you  can take a nice close look at that white meat   guys very very solid when it comes to fast  food chicken i have to say this is looking   really nice hand breaded in store and you can  definitely tell the quality is absolutely there   on it and coming back to the swiss cheese  real quick obviously i can't taste that at   all i'm sure it's just there to kind of hold  the bacon and everything together considering   how slippery this is but honestly i  think in terms of visual representation   they probably could have gone with pepper  jack and that would have been even better   but considering the heat of this hot honey sauce  i'm not missing that at all it's got plenty on   its own so yeah i'm currently filming this in  september when it's technically the fall but   it's literally over 100 degrees in southern  cali here right now as i'm going in on a   hot honey chicken sandwich for you on camera  for the very first time let me grab a drink i'm so glad i've got some water with me  especially with this one here right now but guys   great quality all around and i gotta say  again my all-time favorite flavor so far   of all the other versions of these hand breaded  chicken sandwiches that i've taken a look at   so far which you're probably seeing jumping  up here on the screen right now you've got   plenty to take a look at all right so let's go  for one more bite of this one because that's   pretty much all i can take at the moment  and then we'll close this review out after   the rating coming up next but guys again if  you've got carl's jr or hardees in the area   you need to be jumping on over to give this a  shot because the hot honey sauce is truly legit   considering how tasty it was for shake shack  i would expect nothing less from carl's jr and   it's really awesome that it's on their hand breaded  chicken pretty banging let's go for one more bite well i can't go around the world with this one  considering the back of this wrapper is completely   lit up with that sauce and just be prepared  if you do give this one a shot make sure you   have plenty of napkins on hand because it is very  messy very sticky on top of it and i got to tell   you if you're eating this in your car in really  high degree weather you're going to want to make   sure you've got something to drink with you it is  absolutely worth your time very delicious on this   one yeah my arms are completely lit up right now  i kind of feel like i just took a shower here in   my car guys no lie but let me just tell you it was  completely worth the time because that hot honey   sauce is really the major highlight with this one  on top of the quality of that hand breaded chicken   now keep in mind this sandwich is a little bit  of a premium it's still a little bit up there in terms   of price point but thankfully the flavor delivered  on this one and it really is a banging addition to   their hand breaded chicken lineup over here at carl's  and hardees really good stuff so with that said   and based upon my initial impressions having this  all new hot honey hand breaded chicken sandwich   here at carl's jr i'm going to have to give it  a very awesome 9 out of 10 guys like i said it   really delivered across the board the only hit  against it is the cheese factor i get that they   need something to kind of keep everything together  because it's very slippery very slidy i get that   but at the same time pepper jack would have been  the way to go just to add insult to injury so to   speak because of the quality of that hot sauce  i got to tell you guys that hot honey goodness   is definitely a banging situation just the right  amount of sweetness and overall it delivered   across the board primo all right so if you've got  carl's jr and hardees in the area are you going to   be giving this one a shot drop some comments  down below let me know what your plans are   for this particular one and what do you think of  the hand-breaded chicken in general since they've   launched it over here at carls and hardees do  you actually prefer it compared to the other guys   pop some comments down below and definitely  let me know and with that this is Ian K   closing out another high quality foodie feature  for you here on peep this out reviews bringing   you brand new content every single week here on  my channel so while you stay tuned for that next   review coming real soon in the meantime stay  frosty you know i gotta say ever since carls jr  and hardees introduced these all new  hand breaded chicken sandwiches to their menu   recently they've pretty much been rotating  a lot of the different variations of them a   little bit more routinely than the other guys
