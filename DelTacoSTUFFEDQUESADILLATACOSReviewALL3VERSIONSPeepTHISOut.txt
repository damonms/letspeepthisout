window awesome thank you all right so coming  off of those double cheese breakfast tacos   that i reviewed recently it looks like now  we've got something for lunch and dinner so   i think effectively our bases  are covered hey how you doing yeah can i grab some del scorcho sauce from  you too that'd be awesome hey yeah how you doing   yes please appreciate you thanks so much  stay frosty we'll see you all right guys   let's peep this out all right so here we go with  the all-new stuffed quesadilla tacos and initial   first impressions guys these look to be bursting  at the seams with the good stuff i'm definitely   digging the presentation so far on how these  look all right so starting off at the bottom   with the grilled chicken if you take a look we're  supposed to have two flour tortillas here which we   definitely have and it's supposed to have a decent  amount of queso blanco and cheddar cheese which   it does not actually there's very little to speak  of here on the inside we've got marinated grilled   chicken shredded lettuce diced tomatoes and more  shredded cheddar cheese guys and as you can see   it's looking pretty decent with a very nice  portion of the goodness on the inside of this one   with the exception of what's supposed to be in the  quesadilla but let's just move along to the second   one here we've got the crispy chicken variant  starting off with what we're supposed to have   is a decent amount of queso blanco and cheddar  cheese on the inside of these tortillas and we do   not again i'm a little concerned about this here  but on the inside two crispy chicken strips we've   got the shredded lettuce the diced tomatoes and  more of that cheddar cheese but even still i'm   concerned about the quantity of what's on the  inside of the quesadilla but everything else   so far is looking pretty solid here and rounding  out the trifecta we have the carne asada variant and   again very little on the inside of the quesadilla  portion guys i'm really concerned at this point   the queso blanco and cheddar cheese is virtually  non-existent here but even still on the inside   grilled carne asada and again shredded lettuce  diced tomatoes and more of that cheddar cheese so   very solid filling on the inside of these but the  actual quesadilla and how they're promoting these   i don't know we're just gonna have to see if the  flavor is gonna deliver on it let's do just that   this is the all-new stuffed quesadilla tacos  here at del taco let's peep out this flavor   well i gotta say again i'm pretty concerned about  this one i'm not really feeling a lot of cheese   on the inside of the quesadilla as i'm pressing  into it here but i do like the toastiness of it   it presents well and there's a lot of goodness  on the inside of this here so we're going to get   into this obviously and just like the last time  when i did the double cheese breakfast tacos i'm   going to go for one bite to give you my breakdown  and what it tastes like and then we'll do a little   bit of that del scorcho sauce and then we'll  move on to the next one because there's three   of them here guys and it really is pretty hot  in my car right now let's just give it a shot   it's the grilled chicken variant of the stuffed  quesadilla tacos here at del taco let's do it okay all right i got a little bit of cheese in  the very bottom in the middle from the quesadilla   but obviously it's just a little bit that's the  only thing here but everything on the inside is   definitely singing the marinated grilled chicken  is pretty beautiful the lettuce the cheese the   diced tomatoes i'm not really tasting too  much here we'll just show it to you again   as you can see a little bit of that cheese is  peeking through right there but there's really not   a lot to speak of so far you know what i'm gonna  have to do i think i'm gonna have to go for two   bites before we get into the sauce because guys  so far i really want to like these and i do but   i want there to be more cheese so let's go for one  more bite and then we'll go for that sauce again okay better all right now you can see that half  ring of cheese on the bottom right there there's   definitely more cheese as you get further into  this but naturally it's not really as spread   out as it could be but once you get to it the  flavor is pretty nice nice and creamy on the   queso blanco and of course with that cheddar cheese  mixed with it lovely situation the nice toastiness   that you're seeing right there of course of the  outside simulating that quesadilla goodness and   all the toppings on the inside of this one here  in this case that grilled chicken the cheese the   lettuce the tomatoes pretty tasty this way all  right because i've got it ready and i'm glutton   for punishment right now we're gonna do some del  scorcho on this action so let me get this sized   up for you and we'll get this in just a little  bit hopefully that's coming through and you guys   can see it it's a little blurry hopefully not i'm  gonna try to do the best i can here with this but   as you can see it is what it is at least we got it  in there guys let me give you a quick shot of that   just in case i didn't come out too well a pretty  decent amount let's give it a shot with the sauce banging good but hot oh yeah that's very hot right now man i'm doing this in 100 degrees right  now with a little fan going but even still   very lovely situation on this one and as you can  see even more cheese it's not exactly made the   way i would have liked it because it's very  lopsided but even still once you get to it   pretty nice quality on this one pretty nice  indeed all right moving into the crispy chicken   take a look at this one very hefty on this i've  reviewed these in the past as well the crispy   chicken variants here very thick on that chicken  strip guys and as you can see no shortage of the   cheese on the top let's just hope we have a decent  amount on the inside but very very tasty on this   one as well it's the crispy chicken variant  of the stuffed quesadilla tacos here we go same as before decent filling but not a lot of  cheese on the very end over here we're gonna   have to go for another bite but before i do let me  show you really quick on the inside i didn't get   too much of a chicken on that one there but as you  can see the breakdown is exactly the same they're   all the same other ingredients they're the same  across the board here but even still no cheese   yet on the very bottom so let's go for another  bite before we get into the sauce here we go well it's heartier because i got more chicken and  obviously since i got into the middle area there   there is that ring of cheese on the very bottom  again the case of blanco mixing with that cheddar   is a very nice combination there just needs to  be more of it more evenly spread out throughout   this year and it would be just perfect but as it  stands the nice crispiness of the chicken strips   are pretty awesome and the usual other ingredients  on here that cheese the lettuce the tomato all the   usual goodies it's definitely nice a little bit  of the crunch of the lettuce i'm really liking   with this one here and of course the toastiness  on the outside to simulate that crispy quesadilla   feel it just needs a little bit more cheese but  even still guys very tasty all right you know   what's coming more del scorcho action glutton  for punishment here let's go for a little drip   i think that's probably a better shot than the  last time it's just enough here i think we've   got another packet for the last one there but as  you can see a very decent amount this is a pretty   decent amount of heat guys for del scorcho  it really elevates this big time here we go that's really good with the crispy chicken wow oh   steamy action not like knock your  socks off type of heat but very steamy wow i am literally a mess right now literally   a mess i'm having fun doing this for you but  even still it is very messy here in the car   but lovely situation and again more of that  chicken action very lovely situation indeed   all right enough with the lovely situations for  now let's move on to the carne asada because this   should hopefully be the one that really takes  the crown here because it's got meat in it but   just looking at this i gotta be honest guys you  probably saw this during the initial close-up i   don't really have a lot of carne asada in this  one here so i'm going to try and do the best i   can but as you can see a very decent amount of all  the other toppings on the inside but no cheese to   speak of just yet here so let me see if i can kind  of spread this out just a little bit i'm going to   knock off some of these tomatoes just a little  bit here because it's way too many for my liking   all right one last quick look at this one here  and as you can see again nice toasty action   it's the carne asada variant of the stuffed  quesadilla tacos here at del taco here we go hmm okay there it is i wasn't tasting the  meat real quick but it's coming through   light saltiness that it's got  that's actually pretty good   take a look at that it does seem more plentiful  when you bite into it and you're kind of looking   at it as a cross section and as you can see on  the bottom the cheese is beginning to peek out   just a little bit from that quesadilla but again  you really got to take at least a couple of bites   to get to it so that's a no bueno situation but  even still pretty tasty all right so let me see   if i can guarantee a shot of this cheese in  the very bottom before we get into that hot   sauce because guys i do feel that it's hiding  from me right now let's go for another bite well i guess it's going to come down to  who makes this for you because as you   can see we've got a nice ring of cheese all  along the bottom all the way around this one   here practically guys it looks really nice and  when you pair that up with the carne asada meat   it's looking pretty awesome right there a decent  amount on the inside i was a little worried about   the quantity but even still everything else is  really doing its job here pretty nice on this one   all right you know what's coming next del scorcho  action here we go let's keep this focus i think   we're getting better as we go here just a little  bit and we'll light this one up pretty nicely   there you go very decent amount on this one  here here we go del scorcho action let's do it mmm oh combining with the saltiness of  that meat that's hot oh hang on wow i felt that one more that time around  i guess they say third time's a charm right   because that was pretty crazy wow  very tasty guys very tasty on that   man oh my god i'm burning up right now delicious  stuff all around guys let's wrap this review up   all right so here's an awesome money shot of the  trifecta that is the stuffed quesadilla tacos here   at del taco and guys i'm very impressed with  these as i got further in i was very concerned   in the very beginning i was really hoping there  was going to be more cheese than what's here   but naturally as you get further in you're going  to get to it so it really is a nice quality   product all around depending upon your protein  of choice whether it's grilled chicken crispy   chicken or carne asada they have you covered here  and honestly with a little bit of that hot sauce   action it really elevates these to a new level  of flavor but definitely fun to eat adequately   priced and i gotta say i would definitely  rock these again these are really pretty tasty   try 'em guac'd up too can i get a del yeah all  right so jumping right to the ratings before i   pass out here in my car thanks to the heat  i'm gonna start off with the grilled variant   of these all new stuff quesadilla tacos and i'm  gonna give that one a 7.5 out of 10 it was definitely an above average taco for sure  guys especially for fast food the only thing is   though out of all three of those tacos it had  the least amount of cheese in the quesadilla   everything on the inside definitely sang in terms  of quality and definitely the flavor was good but   i think i needed just a little bit more cheese in  that particular one to really kind of bump up   the rating just a bit but even still pretty tasty  and as for the crispy chicken variant that one's   going to get an 8 out of 10 because honestly that  was a lot heartier believe it or not even though it   was just two chicken strips and it didn't look  like it had as much in it as the grilled chicken   what i've been into was actually pretty hearty  and the overall flavor was good cheese level was   definitely up there as well so that makes the  difference with these because that's the promo   still pretty good and rounding out the trifecta  i'm gonna have to give the carne asada variant an   8.5 out of 10 guys that was probably  the top in terms of flavor because it was a little   bit extra salt but even still there was a lot  more cheese in that one and it felt very very   satisfying to bite into so again like i said it's  going to come down to who actually prepares these   tacos for you make sure you're checking because  there needs to be a lot more cheese on the inside   of these there's plenty of real estate when it  comes to the tortilla size they can definitely do   a little bit better at least with what i had today  but even still the quality was tasty they present   well and they are definitely something to check  out at least once i'd recommend it they are pretty   good all right so as i continue to melt away do  me a quick favor drop some comments down below   let me know if you're going to be giving these a  shot if you have a del taco in the area and how   excited are you to give this a go knowing that  it actually is supposed to have a lot of cheese   on the inside are you excited to hopefully receive  that drop those comments down below and definitely   let me know and with that this is Ian K closing  out another high quality foodie feature for you
