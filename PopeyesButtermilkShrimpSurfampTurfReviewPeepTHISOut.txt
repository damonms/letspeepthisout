we've got some more goodness added to the Popeyes reviews playlist here on the channel beautiful thank you thank you so much they are so friendly here that's awesome awesome thank you so much take care buh bye stay frosty alright guys let's peep this out so here we go with their surf and turf promo featuring their all-new buttermilk shrimp and as always lots of fried goodness on the inside of this box that aroma is absolutely glorious let's go in with the star of the show here we've got three jumbo shrimp that are seasoned up in that Louisiana goodness that Popeyes is known for and then battered up and fried to a crispy golden-brown apparently it's a buttermilk coating and I have to admit that looks a little over fried but I do like the way it looks it looks really really great now the poster said this comes with three boneless wings but it looks like we've got a couple of tenders here and I opted for the spicy variety along with a little nugg on the side so not too bad in terms of the promo for five bucks here and obviously you're getting a lot of that fried goodness as you can see it really takes up a good chunk of the box as it should we've got a biscuit the world-famous goodness for that as well here nice and buttery and of course we opted for some red beans and rice admittedly it's a little on the light side I think we could have got a little bit more on the inside of that but it is what it is and for dipping we're gonna be going into their recommendation the Mardi Gras mustard one of my favorites is here besides the blackened ranch looking really really great so not too bad for five bucks considering this as supposed to be boneless wings and we actually got some strips guys pretty decent this is the all-new surf and turf promo here at Popeyes featuring their buttermilk shrimp let's peep out this flavor so are you a fan of high quality delicious looking food reviews well if so definitely hit that subscribe button down below don't forget to tap that Bell icon so you could be notified as soon as new content drops every week now let's dive into this all right so I'm gonna be pretty much focusing on the buttermilk shrimp specifically because that is the star of the show after all and I'm really thankful that the jumbo shrimp that I have here right now are just that pretty jumbo sometimes it's kind of hit or miss what you get sometimes they're small sometimes they're large this looks pretty even across the board so let's go with the bite of one of these to get it started here guys maybe we'll go for a dip with one of the chicken strips as well here we go with the buttermilk shrimp here at Popeyes mmm oh yeah that's noticeably different guys the shrimp is got a spice to it which is really nice and a creamy heartier type of breading that I'm getting as well definitely buttermilk let me show you this real fast close up hopefully you can kind of see that with the Sun glistening but on the outside of the shrimp itself under the coating I've got a little bit of red goodness there guys there is definitely some spice to this one and the batter itself it's got a very rich buttermilk flavor it's noticeably different than any of the previous reviews I've done featuring shrimp including butterfly this is actually a really tasty coating and it goes extremely well with the juiciness of this shrimp this one in particular was pretty big so really really nice yeah I definitely didn't want to go for a second bite because I wanted you to catch that little bit of spicy goodness on the inside of this one it's a really really nice rich slight spicy flavor that Popeyes is known for I mean it's not really crazy hot but it's got a little bit of sizzle to it but that buttermilk coating is really nice it's very rich and very hearty and guys just delicious stuff here let's go for one more bite and then we're definitely gonna get into some Mardi Gras mustard mmm this is a really good coating and it's so good I just got to finish off the tail hang on mm it's good stuff all right let's go for dip in some mardi gras mustard yeah I'm definitely smelling that horseradish goodness here and I think it's gonna go very nice with the creaminess and the richness of that buttermilk here let's give it a shot and again this is my absolute favorite besides the blackened ranch here we go mm Oh reamy rich buttermilk the heat and bite of the horseradish and the Mardi Gras mustard a little bit of a spice from that as well man that's a lovely situation right now I'm almost sorry I didn't get more of the shrimp to actually go with this I figured the surf and turf was kind of fun to check out it's been a minute since I've done the surf and turf version over here at Popeyes which I've got plenty of those types of reviews in the upper right hand corner for display you can check out the playlist there but Wow really tasty guys really really good stuff mmm all right so let me get into what's normally supposed to be the boneless wings that come with this but we've got a nice looking strip here guys the spicy variety nice and crispy nice and golden nice and fried it's that Popeyes goodness let's go for it now I think most of you guys know I'm pretty much a fan of Popeyes Chicken in general so consider this just an excuse to have this with you right now on camera here we go delicious stuff fried goodness juicy white meat actually this time out a little bit of heat it's a lovely situation mmm this tender's a little on the thin side but I'll take it considering the boneless wings tend to be smaller in general so I'm getting a decent amount of value for my money here with this one and of course all the fried goodness that you know from Popeyes is on display for you here guys all the nooks and crannies that are just begging for that sauce to be dipped into and the white meat is actually kind of juicy this time out definitely digging this today so what do you say we come full circle and actually go for that dip into the Mardi Gras mustard let's do it all right so how many times if you guys see me do this on camera how many times have they dunked into sauces here in my reviews for Popeyes put that number down below in the comments section very curious to see what number you think it is but guys nice and creamy all the good stuff again that horseradish aroma is lighting up my car let's just get into this one and hey given my love for the Mardi Gras mustard over here at Popeyes considering the weather situation in Southern Cali right now which is definitely elevated I'm not minding it one bit right now either okay so good so good let's just finish it mmm so tasty so let's close this one out with another shot of the star of the show the buttermilk shrimp and fortunately it's really living up to its name featuring really rich buttermilk creaminess on top of a fairly jumbo piece of shrimp and thankfully it's also living up to that name your mileage may vary depending upon the shrimp that you get naturally like I said earlier some may be big some be small but this quality that I'm getting today speaks for itself and as you can see pretty nicely done even if it's just a little overfried it delivers you know I'm not hating on the value that I got from my 5 bucks today was a pretty solid value for everything that you saw there and considering it was supposed to come with three boneless wings with the buttermilk shrimp I got two chicken tenders and a half technically it's a lot of meat guys I have to admit including the biscuit and the side so without the drink for five bucks not bad at all and thankfully it delivered in the flavor Department as well I pretty much knew what to expect from the chicken tenders but that buttermilk shrimp was the wild-card and thankfully for the shrimp that I got they were jumbo they were buttermilk and the richness of it was definitely there so I would easily recommend giving this a shot it's pretty flavorful so with that said I'm gonna have to give the all-new buttermilk shrimp as part of the surf and turf here at Popeyes a rock-solid 9 out of 10 and the only reason it's not 10 out of 10 is because they were just a little overfried but don't get me wrong the flavor was absolutely there and you can't go wrong with that Mardi Gras mustard guys it's pretty awesome but of course the question is do you think it looks awesome drop some comments down below did this entice you to jump on over to Popeyes to give it a shot and if you are gonna give it a shot are you gonna get a different dipping sauce instead of that Mardi Gras mustard drop those comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K closing out another episode of peep this out bringing you brand-new content every single week here on my channel
