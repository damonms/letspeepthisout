 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty hey everyone welcome back to another high quality  foodie feature for you here on the channel   cheaters cam style after hours at popeyes to  go in a long overdue sweet treat that looks   perfectly suited to their brand but i gotta be  honest guys i'm a little concerned by what i've   got here right now that's right it's their all new  chocolate beignets and already in the appearance   department i am very underwhelmed what this is  supposed to be is basically a french pastry with   melted hershey's chocolate on the inside and then  topped off with powdered sugar but as you can see   i've got very little of that and honestly  the appearance is very unappealing actually   very very small and it definitely looks fried  but i am not feeling the overall texture of what   i've got here right now guys it looks a little  over fried and honestly not too big at all now   granted i know it's the fast food version of what  these are supposed to be but even still guys they   could be a little bit bigger than what i've got  here these look like really glorified nuggets i   got to be honest but let's see if the flavor  is going to deliver on them it's the all-new   chocolate beignets here at popeyes let's peep  out this flavor well as you heard me say at the   top of this one beignets are pretty much i think  synonymous with popeyes when you think about who's   going to be serving something like this of course  it's going to be popeyes naturally new orleans   louisiana these are very popular down over there  but honestly guys this really looks like an over   fried nugget and that's pretty much it hardly any  powdered sugar and it is very very small i guess   the main thing with this one is they're selling  on the hershey's chocolate being on the inside but   even still that appearance already doesn't look  like a beignet that i'm used to and i got to be   honest these have to be lit up with powdered sugar  they have to be to really be considered legit in   my opinion so let me see if hopefully these  are at least going to be legit in the flavor   department because on the surface this doesn't  feel like a beignet but let's give it a shot it is not a beignet but it's tasty i mean  it's a fried piece of dough synonymous with   an english fritter but the french variant  naturally beignet actually sounds pretty   nice but as you can see on the inside guys  it does have the hershey's chocolate it's   actually okay the sweetness is not too bad  i am just not feeling the overall texture on   this whatsoever this is definitely over fried  and the appearance is giving it away big time   it's really okay in the flavor department very  light light powdered sugar in the very top   of this is what i got with there in the first  bite but very very underwhelmed so far as i'm   trying to keep the focus with the lighting  here so far guys like i said underwhelming   but you know what it is what it is it's a  fast food beignet let's just keep going in the hershey's chocolate is not bad but this is  not worth the hype i got to be honest it really   isn't i mean maybe it's because i've actually  had some really really tasty beignets here in   southern california actually if you want to  see what a real beignet looks like take a   look at the review popping up on your screen  here right now from the jazz kitchen express   i did that at disneyland in downtown disney a  while back that was pretty amazing and that's   going to give you the real authentic look on what  a beignet is at least in the size department but   when it comes to this i mean 3 of these for  $2.40 i mean guys this really is kind of expensive   and i'm really like i said i'm really  very underwhelmed very disappointed   i was really hoping this was going to be good  it really could have been saved if it had just   a little bit more powdered sugar but guys look  at this there is nothing on it it's overly fried   and it's got some hershey's goodness on the  inside that's about it let's go for one more   bite we'll close this one out but so far guys like  i said super underwhelming what are you gonna do well what i can do is give you one more look at  this here and as you can see they really couldn't   spare any powdered sugar for me guys this is  really really sad i am really really really   really disappointed can you tell this could have  been so much better if not if they were just a   little bit bigger that'd be fine but if they had  more powdered sugar and if they weren't fried as   much i think it would have been even better but  guys so far super underwhelming and like i said   3 for $2.40 you can do 6 you can do 12.  start off with the 3 and see how you do   but honestly guys i won't be getting  these again this is really not great well you know they can all be winners and actually  when i go into my reviews i really do hope for   the best but i gotta give you the honest opinion  of what i've got going here guys and as you can   probably see with that that is definitely not  worth the time sorry popeyes this time out i'm   going to have to give you chocolate beignets  a pretty lackluster 4 out of 10 and that's   actually being very very nice about it right now  because like i said the hershey's cocoa goodness   on the inside is decent and the fried texture is  just okay but guys it's overly fried there's no   powdered sugar and it really needs to be just a  little bit bigger i mean for a fast food beignet   you could have done so much better with these and  i'm really surprised that they don't look like the   picture this really doesn't look like the picture  tonight what can you do guys what can you do well   what you can possibly do is drop some comments  down below let me know if you're excited to give   these a shot and if you've had them already did  you have a better experience than i did because   like i said that is completely lackluster and i'm  very very disappointed i'm gonna have to get back   on over to the jazz kitchen express over downtown  disney and get the real deal that's all i have to   say but drop some comments down below let me know  what you thought of these and with that this is   Ian K closing out another high quality foodie  feature for you here on peep this out reviews   cheaters cam style after hours bringing you brand  new
