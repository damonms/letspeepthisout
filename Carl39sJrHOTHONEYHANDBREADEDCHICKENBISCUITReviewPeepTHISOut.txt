 good morning everyone and welcome back to  another high quality foodie feature for you   here on the channel where i'm over at carl's  jr once again to see if the third time's a   charm by going in on the breakfast variant of  their all-new hot honey chicken that's right   and as you obviously know by now i'm going in  on the hot honey hand breaded chicken biscuits   so stay tuned because it's up next welcome to  peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty so here it is the hot honey hand breaded  chicken biscuit and as i'm filming this   early in the am i gotta say that made from  scratch biscuit is looking really nice i   think i'm about to get into some really  solid buttermilk goodness with this one   and of course the chicken on the inside is no  slouch either let's pop the top of this biscuit   and take a look underneath and as you're gonna  see guys that hand breaded white meat chicken   fillet of course dusted in those southern  spices as well as the buttermilk goodness   is really shining through there's a decent amount  of hot honey sauce on it as well and i gotta say   it fills out this biscuit very nicely this is  looking really really great underneath it it   looks like of course we've got more of that hot  honey sauce but guys i keep coming back to it the   chicken and the biscuit combo here looks really  really nice the chicken itself is really filling   out this biscuit beautifully and i can't wait to  get into this so let's not waste any more time on   it this is the hot honey hand breaded chicken  biscuit here at carl's jr let's peep out this   flavor yes sir this is a glorious situation right  here guys i'm really impressed with the amount of   hot honey sauce on this piece of chicken this is  probably one of the best versions that i've tried   yet and i have to say it really presents nicely  of course we've got the buttermilk action going   with the biscuit itself and guys again very very  nice overall in the size department this feels   nice and hefty and plenty of hot sauce to go  with here i can't wait to get into this again   because like i said i'm really hoping the  third time's the charm with this one so without   further ado guys it's the hot honey hand breaded  chicken biscuit here at carl's jr let's do it whoa oh man all right right off the break i'm  gonna say it forget the waffle variant the biscuit   version is where it is at man the butteriness the  buttermilk goodness from the biscuit as you get   into this one and then right into the juiciness  of the chicken the crispiness of the chicken and   then the hot honey sauce forget about it guys this  is the flavor combination you definitely want to   try man this is just on point take a look at that  guys it's got some height it's got some thickness   and man the butteriness of the biscuit sets off  the flavors beautifully and it's your entry point   into flavor nirvana with this one this is really  delicious guys i'm just going to call it right now   right after that first bite this is my favorite  variation of the hot honey chicken over here at   carl's jr the only downside though and as expected  is the biscuit is a little bit on the crumbly side   that's really the only thing you're going to find  that it kind of crumbles and falls apart pretty   easily but it's super fresh and the butteriness  is on point i can't really stress it enough   it's so much better than the waffle so much better  than the sandwich but i gotta say guys again   the combination is working for me right now  let's keep going in this is pretty awesome come on now all right there's the cross-section  shot you want to see right there and again it is a   really nice display of the quality of the biscuit  itself guys just in terms of the height that it's   got because it's so nice and rich and the quality  just really combines beautifully with that chicken   again the hand breaded goodness those southern  spices that i'm getting this is really a lovely   situation and of course the combination is very  simple on this one but guys sometimes like i   always say simplicity is all you really need with  some of these things and this works amazingly   well it's a real signature and i gotta say i'm  really sorry this is not available past breakfast   but hey it's definitely worth getting up for and  i'm so glad that i'm giving this one a shot right   now it is truly banging and not to take too  much away from the regular chicken sandwich   that i reviewed recently along with the waffle  variant but i gotta say guys i'm so glad to give   this one a shot because i don't really get up for  breakfast too early as most of you guys know i'm   not necessarily a morning person so it takes a lot  for me to really give this a shot but considering   how flavorful the hot honey sauce is over here  and i gotta say they're really doing it pretty   nicely at carl's with this particular one like i  said previously this is probably the best flavor i   think they've got so far with this currently right  now so it's really worth your time to check it out   even if you're not a morning person for real all  right so i'm considering this review more of an   add-on to the main sandwich because naturally  this is just a variation of that but guys like i   said it's a simple recipe it works very well i'm  so glad to have given this one a shot right now   and i can't wait to get into this for one  last bite guys again very very solid on this   one and i think obviously the rating is going  to reflect that because this is truly banging   so one more bite before we close it up after the  rating and guys again i'm so glad i'm doing this   for you right now this is definitely a nice  start to my day very very tasty one more bite all right let me go around the world as carefully  as possible with this one guys because it's   beginning to fall apart that's my only major gripe  with this one here but even still the quality of   the biscuit is pretty amazing it works very nicely  with the chicken and overall that hot honey sauce   is a major major addition over here to these  chicken sandwiches just a beautiful situation in   general and again amazing amazing quality guys  i can't stress it enough it is pretty awesome   really really awesome actually and easily the  most difficult out of the three sandwiches that   i've now reviewed over here at carl's jr but guys  easily worth the effort as well too because the   quality is amazing i mean like i said it's a  simple recipe it's just the biscuit the sauce   and the chicken but it works amazingly well  and it's so buttery and so crisp and overall   the heat level is not bad either on this one  i guess i'm kind of getting used to it now but   the quality is seriously up there definitely worth  getting up early in the morning especially for me   so with that said i'm going to have to give the  hot honey hand breaded chicken biscuit here at   carl's jr a rock solid 9.5 out of 10 and the  only reason it loses half a point is strictly   because of how crumbly the biscuit easily becomes  that's really the only thing and i think that's a   testament to the quality of the biscuits still  because even with the amount of sauce on that   it's not keeping everything together but like i  said messy or not it's easily worth your time it's   absolutely delicious it's super fresh and guys  again the combination is amazing on it easily the   best out of the three as far as i'm concerned all  right so the only question i'm gonna ask you after   that last comment is do you agree with me drop  some comments down below if you've given all three   a shot which is your favorite variation of it  there and why drop some comments down below again   and definitely let me know and with that this  is Ian K closing out another high quality foodie   feature for you here on peep this out reviews  bringing you brand new content every single week   here on
