 what's going on everyone welcome and welcome back  to the channel it's Ian K and for today's review   i'm back on over at jack-in-the-box this time to  check out the other version of their super popular   tiny tacos that's right and you already know what  it is because i've got them right here in my hot   little hand and i gotta say these definitely  look pretty awesome so stay tuned because the   bacon loaded nacho tiny tacos are up next welcome  to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty all right so let's get into this real quick  because the aroma in my car is absolutely   amazing right now and let me show you exactly the  reason why guys it's their all new bacon loaded   nacho tiny tacos over here jack in the box and it  looks like we are in for a lots of cheesy smoked   bacon goodness drizzled all on top of what  you've got here this is looking pretty great   all right so breaking this one down from the  bottom up what we've got here is the main star   of the show or one of them i should say those  mini corn tortillas the tiny tacos from jack   in the box a very lovely situation of crispy  goodness filled with a little bit of a mixture   of chicken and some other tasty spices and  naturally these are supposed to be dusted   with nacho seasoning but i have to admit i  am not really seeing that too much on here   but even still what's actually on it looks  like it's going to deliver the flavor goods   either way and what you're seeing there  is a combination of cheddar cheese sauce   bacon crumbles ranch and spicy good good sauce  from their chicken sandwiches all on top of   these tiny tacos so hopefully there's going to be  some nacho flavoring on this guys but even still   we've got plenty of that cheese sauce and of  course the bacon crumbles the ranch and naturally   the spicy good good sauce to go with this is still  looking very delicious and super fun to get into   so yeah you can't really fade the appearance of  this one guys i mean a cheese sauce topped off   with bacon crumbles ranch and some spicy good good  sauce i am definitely digging that combination   just in the breakdown alone but i have to admit  i'm a little concerned that these tiny tacos don't   have any nacho seasoning at least on this one  that i'm showing you here as this focus is in   but guys very small very many let's go for  a little quick bite on this one just to   kind of familiarize myself from the first time  around when i actually did this review hang on it's tasty it's a tiny taco   and yeah even though i'm getting a little residual  back talk so to speak from the cheddar cheese   sauce that's actually on this right now that  flavor is actually pretty nice i'm not getting   any nacho cheese flavoring from the tiny tacos  because it looks like there's at least nothing   on this one here but still super tasty for what  this is guys very very good indeed and honestly i   expect it as much because the base that they're  working with here is pretty tasty and if you   haven't seen my original review of the tiny tacos  the very first one you can take a look at that   one popping up on your screen here right now in  addition to the nacho variant which i checked out   pretty recently i gotta say it was a very lovely  combination of that cheese dusting on the outside   pretty nice okay so let me pick up my trusty  fork and let's get this going here i'm curious   to try the loaded variations of these wow this is  very messy but that's okay lots of goodness here   take a look coated very nicely the cheese sauce  the bacon crumbles in there it looks like that   ranch action as well and no nacho seasoning  just yet but let's just keep going in here we go wow the ranch sauce with the  regular cheddar cheese sauce on this   that's nice that is really nice my taste buds are thanking me right now i'm  telling you right now this is very flavorful   but again no nacho cheese dusting on this  that's a major fail right now jack and the   puck's a major fail for what this is supposed  to be but again with the buts very flavorful   in what you've got here the bacon crumbles  are definitely on point the cheese sauce   the ranch light spicing that i'm getting from  the good good sauce mixed in there as well   it's reminding me the flavor of the chicken  sandwich that i did over here the good old   cluck cluck which you're seeing jumping up  here on your screen got to say i love the   situation i've done all versions of that as well  this is really tasty guys let's keep going in it's crazy flavorful it's salty it's  all the things you want this to be   and of course i really wanted it to  be nacho dusting on the outside but   again with the buts i keep saying but i  don't know what's up but let's just keep going   feast your eyes again plenty of bacon crumbles  jack really knows how to lace up any of their   side items with all the good stuff here the  flavor is off the chart as you'd expect from   ranch baking crumbles and a cheddar cheese  sauce you can put this on just about anything   and it's going to be gluttonous but the base  that it's working with just to lift this out   is a lovely one the corn tortillas are nice  and crispy the chicken mixture on the inside   of it as well it really works nicely but again  i really wish i had a little bit of the duality   of color with the nacho cheese on the outside  of this one here so it is pretty much a fail   for the most part of what this is supposed to  be but it's laced up beautifully with all of   these toppings so let's just go for another  couple on this guys it's pretty tasty still crunchy too digging up yeah how could i not dig  this i mean i love cheese i love the bacon aspect   of it and the ranch and that good good sauce is  a nice combo so let me lather up just one more   of these here before we wrap this up because  i think you get the point jack in the box is   known for some very gluttonously delicious fast  food everything in moderation i always say and   this one is no exception so there you go we'll go  for this one last bite on this one here but i got   to say guys very lovely in the bacon department  the cheese department the ranch department the   spicy good good sauce department and what you've  got is a really awesome base to go on the super   popular tiny tacos over here at jack in the box  one more bite we'll finish this one out hang on well just like i mentioned earlier jack pretty  much excels at what they do with their side items   when it comes to bringing out a loaded variant  there's always some form of cheese some form of   crumbled bacon but i like the addition of ranch  with this on top of that spicy good good sauce   i just wish that the main star of the show  themselves had a little bit of the nacho seasoning   just to give you a little variation in flavor  but what you're looking at here still is very   gluttonous very delicious and of course they're  on the fan favorite tiny tacos very very tasty   on their own anyway get my nacho tiny tacos or try  them bacon loaf order on the jack app today well   i gotta rate him as i get him guys so naturally  this is gonna be knocked down a few pegs because   one of the main stars of the show is not present  but with everything else on it it does deliver   the flavor is pretty banging so with that said i'm  gonna have to give the all new bacon loaded nacho   tiny tacos over here at jack in the box just in  okay 6 out of 10 and guys i think you know the   reason the score is as low as it is there is no  nacho seasoning on the outside of those tiny tacos   as advertised as they should be so with everything  else on that it does deliver the flavor is amazing   and if i was reviewing this just as it is without  the nacho seasoning like i was expecting of course   it'd be like in the 8 to 9 range but when  you're actually advertising nacho i want to get a   little bit of nacho seasoning in with that but let  me just tell you again and again with the buts   plenty of flavor coming from that ranch sauce  the spicy good good sauce the bacon crumbles   and of course the cheddar cheese sauce like i said  that goes amazing on just about anything that you   put it on this is no exception still super fun  to check out all right so do me a quick favor   besides confirming down below in the comment  section if you've actually tried any of these   nacho tiny tacos over here jack in the box yet if  you've tried the actual variation that has nacho   cheese with all the goodies that i'm supposed  to have right now which is your favorite out of   those two i have a feeling it might be that one  drop those comments down below and definitely   let me know and with that this is Ian K closing  out another high quality foodie feature for you   here on peep this out reviews bringing you brand  new content every single week here on my channel   so why stay tuned for the next should be coming  real soon in the meantime stay frosty like i   said i gotta rate him as i get him and jack you  very rarely mess up whenever i review over here   so the fact that this is missing one of the main  stars of the show on top of the star of the show   that's a little disheartening still very delicious  alright guys until next time i'll talk to you soon   hey thanks for checking out another one  of my reviews but just
