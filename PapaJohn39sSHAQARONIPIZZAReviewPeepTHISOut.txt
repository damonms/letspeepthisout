 hey everyone its Ian K for peep this out reviews back at it once again with another high quality foodie feature this time over a good ol Papa John's because apparently something big is going down that's right and when I say big I'm talking shaq-sized big so stay tuned because the shaq-a-roni pizza is up next welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty so here we go with the shaq-a-roni and what's easily a legendary icon combining with an iconic legend of a pizza in this case the classic pepperoni and guys as you can see there is no shortage of it on this one what we've got here is basically a semi thin crust by the way that this is looking with pepperoni lots of it and extra cheese edge to edge all the way through here and it's cut into eight slices almost New York style here so floppablel pieces definitely in check and I got to say guys the smell is awesome of course it's a classic pizza it's pepperoni its cheese but it's lots of it and I got to say it looks really really awesome and of course when you've gotten this much cheese and pepperoni in front of you and naturally with this being Papa John's you've got to go for some dipping action so in this case we've absolutely got some of that garlic dipping sauce to go with and I'm very excited to see what that's gonna do to the overall flavor of everything that you're seeing here right now so let's not waste any more time on this one it's the shaq-a-roni here at Papa John's let's peep out this flavor yes sir so what we're obviously looking at is the namesake of shaq all over an extra large pepperoni pizza with lots of cheese and I'm actually okay with that and judging by the size of this on the plate right now I'm getting that New York slice vibe right over here it's looking really really good but just be warned with all this pepperoni and cheese on it be prepared for the bottom of your box to be a little on the greasy side but again there's nothing wrong with that because grease equals flavor when it comes to pepperoni the greasier the better right so we're definitely getting into this but real quick before I take that first bite and like always if you guys are fans of high-quality

probably my one and only time having a straight pepperoni pizza here on the channel as a review but let's just give it a go and again look at that wet glistening goodness on this one right here Shaq designed let's see if it's approved let's go for it hmm that's a lot of cheese a lot of pepperoni mmm Shaq thank you this is pretty delicious and again take a look at the bottom of that plate guys it is all greasy you can kind of see it there but obviously what you want to see is this no shortage of pepperoni on this one and the crust is fairly thin definitely foldable definitely floppable but I'm loving the overall feeling it's just toasty enough straight pepperoni pizza but with lots of cheese lots of pepperoni to go with let's keep going hmm man this is very gluttonous right now but it's so good and while I'm at it let's just get a little closer in and take a look at that almost edge to edge here the crust is fairly thin as you can see nice and toasty I am really digging the overall quality here it's classic Papa John's flavor but again it's a lot of really delicious cheese and pepperoni that's really what this is guys if you're fans of pepperoni and believe it or not and I've said many times in the past pepperoni is not my go-to I like it it's okay I'm more like sausage personally but this is ridiculously good the saltiness is good the crispness of the actual pepperoni is amazing it's not really as greasy falling off it as it is on the very bottom but look at that guys just really really good so before we go into it further of course we got to go into my favorite that garlic dipping sauce action I'm super excited for this I love garlic sauce over here at Papa John's let's open this up very little b-roll needed with this one here and as you guys can see focus focus then we go essentially this is straight-up garlic butter and it's one of my favorite things here it's a signature obviously so let's go for a dip into this action here right now so we got the nice greasy goodness of that pepperoni plenty of the cheese to go with look at that guys that is a very lovely situation let's give this a go the shaq-a-roni lit up with garlic sauce here at Papa John's mmm as it's going down instantly the pepperoni goodness the butter oh man I'm gonna be running a few miles after this review right now but this is amazing one more time let's do it man look at that guys delicious stuff delicious stuff all around I am diggin it pepperoni like I said not my favorite but I am loving it with this mmm yup well the flavor's exactly like you'd expect it to be from a pretty quality made pepperoni pizza guys with extra cheese and extra pepperoni just a lovely flavor profile on this one with plenty of all the goodness that Papa John's does extremely well with that semi thin crust in here as well too and I love the fact that it's virtually edge-to-edge there's just a lot of goodness on this one pair it up with that garlic dipping sauce and you guys are gonna be in for it it is really delicious with that so with that said I'm gonna have to give the shaq-a-roni the exclusive name for this pie over here at Papa John's a pretty rock-solid 9.5 out of 10 and guys that's saying something because like I said earlier pepperoni is not really my go-to but that one it was a very well-made pepperoni pizza with plenty of cheese plenty of pepperoni and just overall a very gluttonously delicious experience especially diving into that garlic dipping sauce you guys are gonna love it I'm telling you it's awesome with that all right so now the obvious question because I think virtually anyone watching this review right now has pretty much had pepperoni pizza at some point in their past whether more recently or literally way back in the day I think most of you know a pepperoni pizza tastes like how excited are you to try an extra large version of it with even more pepperoni and extra cheese than you're probably normally used to drop those comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K closing out another episode of peep this out bringing you brand new content every single week here in my channel so while you stay tuned for that
