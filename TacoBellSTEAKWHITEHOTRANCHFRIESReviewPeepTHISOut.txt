 what's going on everyone and welcome or  welcome back to the channel it's Ian K  where today i'm over at taco bell to take a  look at what's supposed to be a quote-unquote   new version of their popular nacho fries that's  right so stay tuned because the steak white hot   ranch fries are up next welcome to peep  this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty well if you've seen one nacho fries supreme  variant over the years here at taco bell chances   are you've pretty much seen them all right  the appearance is pretty similar but the main   difference with this new one is it's supposed to  have a little bit of an extra kick and we're about   to find out so guys without further ado feast your  eyes on the steak white hot ranch fries here at   taco bell and again very familiar territory with  this one lots of cheesy ooey gooey goodness to go   on top of their seasoned fries let's break this one  down real quick all right so what we've got here   is a very nice portion of seasoned nacho fries  featuring the bold mexican spices as always and   this one's going to be topped off with a little  laundry list of goodies here starting off with   steak nacho cheese sauce a white hot ranch sauce  which actually features ghost chili peppers and   creamy buttermilk shredded cheddar cheese tomatoes  and reduced fat sour cream to add even more color   white to this particular one guys it looks very  cheesy very gooey and i gotta say the portion   size is looking pretty dynamite so there you go  another familiar looking item here at taco bell   but one that's supposed to deliver a little bit of  kick to it let's not waste any more time let's see   if it does these are the all-new steak white hot  ranch fries here at taco bell let's peep out this   flavor yes sir a pretty decent portion on this one  for sure and it appears to be in a recyclable type   of tray this time out not the usual black tray  and guys honestly that's a step in the right   direction because this is basically a compostable  plant fiber type of situation that turns into soil   after 90 days so i'm kind of digging this already  because believe it or not this is a larger portion   that i'm normally used to whenever i get the nacho  fries in supreme form over here but still looking   pretty dynamite and again i'm really hoping the  kick is going to deliver on this one supposedly   with ghost chili peppers infused into that  buttermilk ranch sauce the hot ranch goodness   let's see if this is actually going to be exactly  that i'm going to grab a little bit of everything   here the cheese goodness and i'm thinking that's ranch  it's mixing with the sour cream pretty nicely all   right there we go got a little bit of everything  there minus the steak let's grab a little steak   piece here and they don't have too many of them  on this one here but there we go lots of goodness   there let's give this a shot guys the white hot  ranch nacho fries over here let's give it a shot ooo there comes the heat yeah this is elevated  and i do not have a drink with me today   mmm wow i'm liking that flavor that's nice sizzle  and burn light coolness coming up on the back end   yeah that's noticeably hot let me keep  going in here because i have a feeling   my voice is going to go the  further i get into this but wow   as i'm getting further in it is getting deeper  and deeper with that burn in the back of my   throat here right now but i'm loving all  the gooey cheesiness guys you can really   taste the fries pretty nicely but naturally  that sauce is beginning to do its job hang on wow yeah this is absolutely elevated  my mouth is watering as i'm talking   right now it is very very strong as you get  further in and i gotta say the more it sits   in your mouth after you swallow it believe  it or not the more impactful it becomes   but guys i'm liking what it's adding to the party  here with all the other flavors of taco bell that   you know and love including the seasoning on  those fries pretty nice so far yeah man this   is definitely heated right now and thankfully i've  got my little fan going but i gotta be honest too   this is kind of giving me shades of reaper ranch  from back in the day i gotta admit this is very   similar to that review that i did back then with  the reaper ranch fries another similar concept but   with more of the ghost chili pepper action grinded  into that sauce and naturally with that ranch but   wow that is very nice and i've actually got a  decent portion of steak here a little bit under   the fries which is a nice surprise but guys  let's go for another couple on this one here   very lovely situation overall it's exactly  what i'd expect from taco bell all those   familiar flavors with the added kick of heat it's  definitely feeling more elevated the white hot   name i think is a fun marketing gimmick i think  to go with this but wow this is really hanging   out in the background as i'm going further in so  let's just do just that another couple on this cheesy sour cream goodness of course mmm  man i am digging that that's really tasty   and again you can fade the portion size  like i said this is very very nice with   the amount of goodness i have on the inside  here it's pretty much filled very nicely   and more of the steak action i really am a fan of  the steak over here taco bell let me see if i can   try and focus that just a bit for you it's fairly  meaty just a little overcooked just a bit but it   goes very nicely with that sauce and the cheese  sauce action i am really really digging that   let's go for another bite here because i think  i've pretty much gotten everything i can out of   this familiar flavor of course very tasty indeed  and again it's exactly what i expected it to be   just with a little bit of added kick believe  it or not from that sauce it's really really   tasty though it really is all right so let's go  for that one last bite on this one we'll wrap   the review up with the rating coming up next  but guys again familiar territory but still   very fun and thankfully in a larger portion size  considering the price point here in southern cali   a little bit more elevated this is still pretty  banging one more bite we'll close it out hang out well i'm kind of surprised even though i'm not  surprised considering i had a feeling what i   was going to be getting into with this one but  actually the white hot name is warranted guys   it really is an elevated heat compared to  what i'm used to in the past from taco bell   but i'm surprised they're not leading with  the ghost pepper goodness with it but still   white hot does look good for marketing and i gotta  admit it looks just as good on their posters as it   does all over these fries pretty tasty order ahead  and pick yours up at our contactless drive-thru   and hey if going even greener with the packaging  means we get actually more product for the money   i'm all for it guys because again this is a very  cool thing to have this compostable plant fiber   goodness which turns into soil after 90 days i am  totally digging that very very slick indeed all   right so as for the rating i'm gonna have to give  the steak variant of these white hot ranch fries   here at taco bell a pretty awesome 7.5  out of 10 i'm not gonna go much higher than   that because guys it gets a few extra points  strictly because of the heat level which i'm   really digging but that's exactly the same type  of thing i've had many times over the years here   at taco bell just with a different name but still  a little bit of added spice and that's not a bad   thing because overall it goes pretty beautifully  with the seasoning on those nacho fries directly   and in general with everything else all the nacho  cheese goodness on that the sour cream it goes   very very nice indeed definitely something to  check out and i have a feeling if you've made   it this far into the review you already have what  you're going to so do me a quick favor drop some   comments down below confirm that goodness for me  let me know what you thought of this one when you   gave it a shot and how do you think it compares  to some of the other nacho fries variants that   they've had over the years i'm very curious to  hear what you have to say so drop those comments   down below and with that this is Ian K closing  out another high quality foodie feature for you   here on peep this out reviews bringing you brand  new content every single week here on my channel   so while you
