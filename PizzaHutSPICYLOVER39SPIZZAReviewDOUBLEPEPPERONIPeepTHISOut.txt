 all right real talk if you're one of those types  of peeps that likes to sprinkle a little something   or maybe pour a little something on your pizza  to kick up the spice just a bit if that's your mo   boy do i have something for you right now  well actually pizza hut's got something   for you right now okay scratch that we both  have something for you right now stay tuned   guys because your advanced first look at their  all new spicy lovers pizza is coming up next   welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty all right so i know you're ready for it so let's  peep this out guys it's the all-new spicy lovers   pizza from pizza hut and i got to tell you guys  this is looking mildly threatening just in the   appearance department i'm definitely digging the  presentation and there is lots of spiciness to   be had on this one for sure so what we've got here  is a large 8 slice pie featuring a base of spicy   marinara sauce that features extra garlic to  increase the heat level and from there we move on   to two different kinds of kickin pepperoni the  classic pepperoni that we know and love as well   as the cup and crisp pepperoni that's actually  laced with paprika so expect another level of heat   from that and from there guys raging red jalapenos  that are actually a little bit sweet but of course   adding more heat to the party and to finish it  off we have what they're calling fiery flakes made   from a custom blend of herbs and crushed chili  peppers so guys across the board you've got layers   upon layers of heated goodness to go across all  the cheesy goodness that you're looking at here   on top of it but guys again the presentation  looks mildly threatening and let me just say   the aroma in my car is lighting up big time this  really smells pretty fantastic so without further   ado there you go it's the spicy lovers pizza  here at pizza hut let's peep out this flavor   yes sir i'm kind of digging the sweet aroma in  my car right now to go with a really beautiful   presentation but again it looks mildly  threatening i mean guys it's spicy and you   can obviously tell with all those ingredients  on here right now so let me put this box down   we'll pick up one of these slices here  really quick yes sir take a look at this   very very nice those red jalapenos are looking  pretty awesome the two types of pepperoni   the flakes that you can see in there as well and  of course that spicy marinara sauce guys very   excited to give this a shot here we go it's the  spicy lovers pizza here at pizza hut let's do it oh there it comes the sizzle creeps up and then is  all over the place right now guys   hang on one second i'm glad i've got some water wow very vibrant in flavor a little bit  of the sweetness that i'm actually getting   from those red peppers the sauce has just a  little bit of extra heat to it as well but   i am really digging that overall quality what  we've got here right now along with the pepperoni   which has a little bit of heat as well too guys  because of the paprika the cup and crisp is lit   up right now this is really some spicy action  for sure but of course you'd expect that with   a name like spicy lovers pizza right yeah this  thing is definitely layered with heat i mean   you're guaranteed to get heat with every single  bite of this i mean starting off with the base   of the spicy marinara sauce which has garlic  anyway guys moving on from there you've got the   pepperoni which of course the cup and crisp having  laced a little bit of paprika around each of them   naturally the crisping up is definitely awesome  it's nice and crispy nice and toasty and then   when you finish that off with the red jalapenos of  course for sweetness and heat and the fiery flakes   with the blended crushed goodness guys delicious  stuff let's keep going in this is pretty banging mmm you know one thing that i really like about  this is that it's not heat just for the sake   of having some heat there's some pretty well  thought out ingredients with this and they   all combine to form a very pleasurable  experience flavor-wise so it's not just   about that heat factor but also being able to  taste everything and the quality is very high   for a pizza of this caliber to deliver heat on  top of flavor that's definitely a lovely situation   and i guess the one good thing about this is the  fact that no other chain out there right now is   offering a dedicated spicy type of pizza on the  menu so pizza looks like they're the first to   do that and i gotta say guys the initial entry  for this is definitely a banging situation but   on the real i'm definitely looking forward to  a possible stuffed crust version in the future   i'd love to see maybe like a pepper jack  thing in there some crushed jalapenos or   a combination of the two naturally i think that  would be beautiful i mean pizza hut's known for   stuffed crust why can't we get some pepper jack  in the near future pizza hut if you're watching this   i would highly recommend that definitely  a banging situation let's keep going in man that was really tasty heck i wouldn't even  mind a detroit style variant of something like   this because a thicker piece of pizza with all of  the actual heated ingredients on this the flavor   combination and even a thicker combination in  general that would be pretty awesome but guys   i am definitely taking this already we're gonna  go for a couple more on this guys it's easily   worth it especially if you like spice you  have a lot to look forward to with this one yeah and you should definitely look  forward to having some water with   you at the same time because guys  like i said it is pretty heated   very very nice but just so you guys also know  if you're watching this on january 27th which is   the official launch date for this particular one  not only do you have the double pepperoni variant   available to you you've got two other ones there's  a hawaiian chicken some spicy hawaiian chicken and   a spicy veggie lovers at the same time so three  different options total and guys again the heat   level is beautiful on this it's tolerable i'd want  to say maybe for me about a six or seven or so   but it's noticeably elevated and there's nothing  needed that in terms of adding extra sauce or   anything else you want to sprinkle on this if  you want it hotter you can do that but on its own   you're going to get a nice sizzle a nice burn but  it resonates beautifully in your mouth and again   the flavors are pretty awesome on this guys very  very tasty all right so you know what let me take   one more quick bite of this one before we close  this advanced first look out on this one right   now because honestly my mouth is a little numb  at the moment but i'm liking it guys because the   quality is good for the ingredients i can actually  taste it on top of the heat that i'm experiencing   but again a very very fun thing to check out and  for all you spice lovers out there definitely a   banging situation for sure hang on let me grab  one more bite and we'll finish it out hang on yes sir hand crafted bold rich flavor with  this one with some heat to match and guys   with spicy in the name like i said you'd expect  there to be some heat so come prepared for this   one because you're going to get it it is really  really nice overall but very pleasurable in the   flavor department with a little bit of sweetness  but overall very very solid for pizza hut and i   have to say this is something that i would rock  again very very tasty on this all right so because   pizza had actually sent this one to me as part  of an advanced look which in turn is letting me   give you guys an advanced look right now i was in  no way directed to actually make a video on this   it's pretty much my choice to do that so naturally  they're not telling me what to say in this video   right now this is my own personal opinion  as always let me just say this was very fun   to check out right now and like i said this is a  pretty tasty pizza for sure guys i mean how could   it not be with all those ingredients on top so if  you guys are curious about the other two which i   would definitely like to check out and of course  give an official rating too drop some comments   down below let me know what you'd like me to start  off with the hawaiian chicken or the veggie lovers   i'm definitely curious to know what you think  overall and as for this variation the double   pepperoni drop some comments down below and let  me know what you thought of the presentation and   the overall list of ingredients that this one has  got are you super excited to give this one a go   i'd venture to guess if you've made it this far  into the review you're probably mildly interested   just a bit so drop those comments down below and  definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K   closing out another high quality foodie  feature for you here on peep this out reviews   bringing you brand new content every single week  here on my channel so while you stay tuned for that next   review coming real soon in the meantime stay  frosty yeah i'm definitely holding out hope for   a stuffed crust variation of something like this  in the future because you'd expect something like   that from pizza hut and considering i love cheese  for sure pepper jack or some form of that mixed in   with some crushed jalapenos or something along  those lines would really complement everything   else on this right now beautiful combination of  ingredients and the heat level banging all right   guys until next time i'll talk to you soon  hey thanks for checking out another one of   my videos but just in case you didn't see the one  before this one you can find it right up over here   along what i think youtube's gonna recommend  for you to check out as well as always i think   you'll find something like in both of them and  i'll definitely catch you in the next one see ya
