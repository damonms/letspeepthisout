stuffed crust pizza from Pizza Hut and definitely a lovely situation here for $11.99 a pretty good value with three toppings the three toppings of choice as you can see we've got some mushrooms some ground beef and some sausage together and of course the main star of the show is gonna be what's in the very back laced up very nicely looks like that crust is dusted with some garlic maybe a little bit of parmesan and it's stuffed with cheese and guys it looks really really tasty let's see if I can come around the side here and lift one of these up yeah we definitely have some cheesy goodness on the inside you can see right there and absolutely a very hot situation indeed and again $11.99 for three toppings a pretty awesome value right now on the size of the crust varies a little bit on each of them but you can see a lot of cheese looking really really good so let's see if the flavors gonna deliver on this one how could it possibly not this is the original stuffed crust pizza from Pizza Hut with three toppings for $11.99 let's peep out this flavor so after hours late night pizza how bad could that really be especially when the crust is stuffed with lots of cheese a lot of cheese late-night and anything bready is gonna be awesome in my book I'm telling you right now I'm already looking forward to this so before I get into it to see if I can confirm that obvious goodness I

so you can kind of see what I'm looking at here there we go lots of gooey cheese that is just looking amazing but first things first let me get into exactly what I've got here with these three toppings that ground beef the sausage the mushroom it's definitely looking pretty awesome and then we'll get into that crust and confirm it for you so let's give it a shot real fast mmm nice very nice now keep in mind you can pretty much go for any three toppings that you'd like on your pizza but for me I definitely wanted to go for the sausage and mushroom that's my favorite anyway and then the ground beef to add a little bit more meaty goodness but guys a very lovely situation as you can see there a decent amount of cheese not too bad there are some spots that don't have a lot of cheese on them but I'm really diggin the overall thickness of the crust itself but speaking of the crust let's go for a bite in the back and again I'll give you one more close-up of that right there and it's a little contrasty let me see there there we go nice and focused in for you look at all that cheese hanging out in the very back here and again the dusting of the crust itself is looking pretty nice a little bit of a garlic parmesan feel to it there may be a little olive oil but the goodness on the inside let's give it a shot the original stuffed crust pizza here at Pizza Hut mm-hmm it's good it's good but as good as it is it's reminding me of something else and I'll tell you what that something else isn't just a second but let me bring you a little closer in here as you can see a pretty decent amount there this is pretty much end to end all throughout the crust here that's a nice solid chunk out the very back for you but I gotta say as good as this is and let me just get right to it this is seriously wanting me to go for that stuffed crazy bread over Little Caesars one more time because honestly this needs to be a little bit more packed with cheese what is here is not bad but I'm feeling like it needs just more but guys it's delicious don't get me wrong the flavor is amazing and again it's stuffed crust it's amazing here let me go for another bite real fast hmm yeah it's good but I almost really want the crust to be a little bit more puffy or just like those breadsticks are over at Little Caesars it keeps reminding me out of here and again I'm gonna keep giving it as many close-ups as I can I know it's a little contrasty as it focuses in but take a look it's a decent amount of cheese and it's pretty solid mozzarella but honestly I really want it to be just a little bit thicker I'm liking what I have here don't get me wrong and again the value is high $11.99 for a three topping depending upon the one that you get this is actually not bad let me go for one more bite of this then we'll go for another bite in the back one more time and finish this one out but guys it's as tasty as you'd expect it to be and honestly the main thing selling this right now aside from what it is is the price point a 3 topping large not a bad deal especially with that stuffed crust in the very back one more bite here and then in the very back and then we'll finish it out yeah I'm so glad I got these three toppings but as I'm getting into the slice here I'm noticing there's really no cheese in the very back of this here it's pretty much in the crust itself which is a good thing but naturally you want to have a little bit more spread out throughout the pizza as well and some of the other pieces that I was looking at on the initial close-up I was doing for ya looks like they really didn't go a little heavy-handed as they probably should have to really kind of round it out here but the toppings are decent decent amount of the sausage the mushroom and that beef and overall the quality is decent here guys but you know what it's all about this stuffed crust and again one more time just to round this one out here for ya a lovely situation of that cheese on the inside you can almost see towards the very end of this one here a lovely situation indeed and the quality is pretty decent overall I would probably just verify when you get it that you have a decent amount of cheese on top because you really want to have that disbursement to be pretty much even across the board so one more bite with this one one more fast close up for you and again we'll finish it out here we go mmm well they definitely do a solid version of the stuffed crust over here at Pizza Hut whether they actually created the very first version of this or not you guys let me know down in the comments if that's true or not but they really do a very nice job of this version of it here and again with the toppings your toppings of choice a lovely situation again just verify you have enough cheese all throughout the pizza but the main star of the show with this one really is highlighted beautifully and it's a nice combination with the butteriness the garliciness that you're seeing of the actual crust itself just a nice combination of those together so with that saying I'm gonna have to give the original stuffed crust pizza the three topping variant for $11.99 over here at Pizza Hut are pretty decent 8.5 out of 10 it was oh so close to that 9 category if the actual pizza itself was full of the cheese are all around the middle of it as opposed to the very outer ring there but again I know the big selling point is the stuffed crust but the main event when you get to it you really want it to be kind of like a little bit more heartier that way at least for me I got to have more cheese but decent for what I got tonight and still pretty decent overall pretty bangin value now the obvious question is did this look like a pretty bangin value to you do me a quick favor did you think this was actually a good deal for $11.99 and if you're a fan of stuffed crust pizza who do you think does it the best I mean pizza hut says they're the originator of it but if that's actually true again drop those comments down below and let me know but let me know what you think overall of what you saw tonight and with that this is Ian K closing out another episode of peep this
