 what's going on everyone it's Ian K back again  with another high quality foodie feature for   you here on the channel where this time i'm over  at popeyes to check out the quote unquote naked   version of their ultra popular chicken sandwich  that's right there's no need to cover your eyes   for this one let's get into it it's the classic  blackened chicken sandwich here at popeyes and i   gotta say already this is looking pretty inviting  guys and definitely different compared to what   you're used to over here at popeyes so popping  the top of that familiar brioche bun you're   gonna find we've got plenty of mayo here guys  and that's sitting all on top of a non-battered   non-breaded white meat chicken filet that's coated  in a thin crust of spice on spice and i gotta say   guys it's a pretty sizable piece of chicken here  this is still looking pretty good even if it's not   exactly dressed the way you remember underneath  it it looks like we've got more mayo along with   a couple of pickles but guys again coming back  to that chicken it is looking really nice you   can really see this thing is absolutely seasoned  up beautifully and the chicken is pretty sizable   so let's not waste any more time on this one this  is the classic blackened chicken sandwich here at   popeyes let's peep out this flavor well i gotta  say even though this one's going commando i'm   absolutely digging the spicing that you can easily  see on the chicken there guys and while it's not   super high because there's no breading on it there  it is sizeable because it's taking up the good   width of the bun the pickles of course are looking  pretty fantastic and that bun although it's kind   of cracking just a little bit it's still looking  pretty inviting because it's nice and soft still   so here we go it's the classic blackened  chicken sandwich here at popeyes let's do it juicy whoa yeah that first bite was super  flavorful guys and the pickles have a lot   to do with that the acidity the snap the crunch  all the good flavor that they're adding overall   dovetailing into the chicken itself and  guys again all white meat goodness on   this one this is a solid block of chicken  without the breading but with the spicing   on the outside i'm definitely digging the  presentation it's nice and soft on that bun   but guys super flavorful light saltiness  which i'm digging let's keep going in you know you'd be hard-pressed to tell me  this is a piece of fried chicken because   they do make it the same way as the standard  chicken sandwich just without the coating on   the outside and guys even still the juiciness  is on point the pickles are pretty awesome   and while the thickness is not quite there on  the chicken itself it's sizeable because like   i said it's covering the whole bun this is a  pretty banging chicken sandwich in naked form   you know i gotta say i really hope they push this  one a little bit more because this is actually   hiding on the popeye's app if you take a look  right now you're probably gonna see under the   chicken sandwich in the very bottom you've got  a classic variant and a spicy variant and of course   the spicy version is coming up soon here in the  channel but guys very delicious on this and on   the real while i'm not a super fan of mayo like  i've said a million times in the past it actually   works very very well with this and it's a quality  type of mayo because it's not disappearing into   the bun you can still see it on the sandwich  itself you can kind of see it creeping in on   the bottom right there very decent amount of  everything on here but the juiciness of that   white meat is impressive considering there's  no breading on this just a banging situation   all right let's go for a couple more bites guys  because like i said i was super curious to check   this one out because it was on the app and i'm so  glad that i did because this is easily something   that i would rock out with in addition to the  regular chicken sandwich on occasion pretty good you know as i'm about halfway into the sandwich  right now i'm starting to pick up more on the   spice of the chicken itself here and it really  is reminding me of the blackened tenders that i   reviewed not that long ago you're probably seeing  that review popping up on your screen here right   now that was something really different to try  again it was popeye's chicken without the breading   but with that crusted type of spice coating on the  outside that's exactly what this is on a grander   scale because of the size of the chicken but  guys it is a nice alternative i got to tell you   and calorie wise about 300 or so calories  less than the regular chicken sandwich   pretty good all right so let's go for one more  bite in this one we'll close it up after the   rating but guys another super delicious option  over here at popeyes that you may actually find   on your app right now take a look and definitely  drop a comment down below and let me know if   you see it but guys like i said a very cool  alternative one more bite and we'll finish it up so what you're looking at here is exactly what  they toss into their breading before they throw   it into the fryer and cook it up for you guys  and again like i said a quality piece of chicken   you can really see the white meat goodness on  this and like i said even without the breading   the flavor is absolutely there definitely  different compared to what you're used to   but with the pickles and the mayo and  the softness of the bun on this one just   a delicious chicken sandwich alternative and  another option over here at popeyes pretty cool   and on the real i probably should have had the  chicken diaper on that one because it absolutely   was leaking out the back but even still guys  very delicious and like i said it's great to have   another option on the popeye's menu especially  one without clothes so with that said i'm gonna   have to give this naked edition aka the classic  blackened chicken sandwich here at popeye's a   pretty rock solid 9 out of 10 guys it was  juicy it was flavorful and with the bun cracking   just slightly there it was fresh but i have a  feeling it wasn't as fresh as it could have been   even still everything else delivered on this one  and the pickles another major highlight it goes   extremely well with the spicing of the chicken  itself and as you saw that chicken is pretty   sizable it took up the whole bun which i was very  satisfied with just a delicious chicken sandwich   all right two questions because i alluded to  it in the very beginning of this review do   you personally have this option available in the  popeye's app when you're looking at your device   drop some comments down below let me know if  it's available to you and if you do have it   are you gonna be giving this one a shot drop  some comments down below and definitely let me   know and with that this is Ian K closing out  another high quality foodie feature for you   here on peep this out reviews bringing you brand  new content every single week here on my channel   so while you stay tuned for that next review coming real  soon in the meantime stay frosty alright let me   remind you one last time if you do give this one  a shot do not forget to eat it with this chicken   sandwich diaper trust me this thing is going  to leak out the back it's pretty fresh because   it's made to order pretty banging alright  guys until next time i'll talk to you soon   hey thanks for checking out
