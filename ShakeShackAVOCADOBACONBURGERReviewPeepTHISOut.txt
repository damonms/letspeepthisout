 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty hey everyone welcome back to another high  quality foodie feature for you here on the   channel where this time i'm over at shake  shack because it looks like they're lacing   up their menu with some awesome looking avocado  action so you already know it's about to go down   and going down it most definitely is feast your  eyes on their all-new avocado bacon burger and   already this presentation is screaming shake shack  guys this is looking really really nice let's pop   the top of this lightly toasted yet soft bun and  see what we've got here and what we've got is part   of the namesake of this one some freshly sliced  avocado two decent sized pieces there guys and   it's also sitting with their famous shack sauce  a very lovely situation and to go along with that   action we've got some niman ranch applewood  smoked bacon antibiotic-free if you're wondering   but as you can see here it looks like we've  got about four pieces but in actuality i think   it's just two strips that they split in half but  guys still a decent amount of bacon nonetheless   and to round out those toppings we've got a slice  of american cheese and of course that's sitting on   top of a 100% beef patty guys looking like maybe  about a quarter pound or so but as you can see   it's got some nice caramelization around the edges  and definitely looking pretty nice even if it's   just a single and as for the very bottom it looks  like there's nothing there but guys take a look   at that beef patty one more time they're looking  pretty nice guys and again the overall quality of   the ingredients on this one is screaming some  good stuff to me right now so i think this is   going to be pretty delicious so there you go  it's the all-new avocado bacon burger here at   shake shack let's peep out this flavor yeah this  isn't no avocado spread or some form of guacamole   this is the freshly sliced good stuff guys and  it's looking pretty awesome to go with all the   nice caramelization that you're seeing with this  beef here and of course the bacon and the cheese   and guys again i'm totally digging the burger  diaper they give you here with these not that i   think it really needs it because there's really  not too much sauce in it but it kind of keeps   your hands clean nonetheless guys but again  the softness of the bun feeling pretty nice   all right so let's get this one moving it's the  all-new avocado bacon burger here at shake shack all right first off with this being shake shack  you already know the flavor is gonna pop right   away and it really really does guys the flavor  of the meat is so distinct over here and the   caramelized edges right away the juiciness factor  is of course there now to the american cheese that   combination alone with the bacon is banging and  just to give you a fast look before i get further   in guys really lovely situation the really  only main addition to this with that avocado   is adding some creaminess which is not a bad  thing because this is basically one of their   main burgers just with that added condiment on  top but guys let me just say a lovely situation   indeed and hey you know what now that i think  about it i probably shouldn't label the avocado   as a condiment i mean it's doing more than adding  just a little bit of flavor the overall creaminess   and everything that it's doing definitely feels  upscale definitely like i said earlier not a   spread not a guacamole type of situation freshly  sliced and it's banging let's keep going in yesir i do love me some crispy applewood smoked  bacon and that's exactly what's on here guys a   lovely situation it definitely feels like it's  plentiful even though it's really like two strips   cut in half but guys the flavor with the beef and  that shack sauce is amazing and then the creamy   factor of the avocado coming up on the end is a  very lovely situation really really tasty on this   and how could it not be i mean it's just a  very well made bacon cheeseburger here at   shake shack and considering the quality of  the ingredients that you're getting on top   of that everything else is singing with  this on top of the avocado which again   there's two spears of the goodness on here  it looks like here based upon how they cut it   but guys the creamy factor is banging on it  and again when you combine it with all the   iconic flavors that shake shack is known  for with that shack sauce and everything   else in here you've got a very delicious bacon  cheeseburger let's keep going in it's really good yeah as i'm getting further into this right  now that shack sauce along with that avocado   is really becoming a lethal flavor combination  guys it really goes very nicely and of course   the creaminess of the cheese and everything  else with this it's just a very small type   of upgrade with avocado added to it's already  here but it does so much flavor-wise and the   combination of the textures really really  great and again coming back to it it's all   with the beef over here at shake shack so the  quality of what you're getting that distinct   flavor just the overall appearance of it is  a banging situation while you can get this   in double form i think the single is perfect  because all the flavors are pretty much even   and you can taste everything there's really not  one overabundance of the other but the quality   of the bacon the beef the avocado the cheese the  softness of the bun it's just a banging situation   all right so one more bite we'll close  this one up after the rating but guys a   very lovely outing over here at shake shack  and something i was really looking forward   to check out because it is super satisfying  right now one more bite we'll close it up yesir let's go around the world with this one  here guys because i want to show you the very back   of this one even though you've got that burger  diaper to catch everything there the unique way   that they cut the buns here at shake shack kind  of helps you in general because as you can see   it's not really fully cut in half so that's a  cool thing right there but guys even still you're   getting something to hold all this deliciousness  in place and i got to admit guys a delicious   situation here that avocado is done very well  with this shake shack burger really nice so   jumping right to the rating i'm gonna have to give  the all-new avocado bacon burger here at shake   shack a rock solid 9 out of 10 and the only  reason i'm not really giving it that perfect 10   even though it is kind of close is the price point  guys at almost 9 dollars for that on the single   it's very pricey but even still the quality  is awesome i see what they're selling here   and of course the avocado commands that premium  but even still at almost 10 dollars for a single   without a drink without fries it's pricey  but even still delicious stuff all right so   i've got one basic question for you outside of  the obvious if you're gonna give this one a shot   or not because if you've made it this far into  the review you're probably gonna do me a quick   favor let me know if you're gonna give this one  a go are you doing it as a single or a double   drop those comments down below and definitely  let me know and with that this is Ian K  closing out another high quality foodie  feature for you here on peep this out   reviews bringing you brand new content  every single week here on my channel   so while you stay tuned
