 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty hey everyone welcome back to another high quality  foodie feature for you here on the channel this   time over at taco bell for a little quickie  review and taste test of their all all-new   green sauce that's popping up in select markets  around the country so without further ado let's   take a look at it here and as you can see it looks  like pretty much any other type of standard green   sauce you'd probably find at say the supermarket  or maybe even a restaurant on the table with some   chips but with this one this is looking to feature  three key ingredients fire roasted green chilies   pureed jalapeno and hatch green chilies so  i'm thinking this is gonna be pretty tasty   and i thought i'd pair it up with just the  standard soft taco to see how this is gonna be so   let's not waste any more time let's get into  it and see if it's gonna deliver this is the   all new green sauce here at taco bell let's peep  out this flavor yeah this definitely smells like   it's got a little bit more kicked up into it guys  and again with the three main ingredients with the   fire roasted green chilies the pureed jalapeno  and the hatch green chilies that combination i   think is going to deliver some heat so again  let me give you another look here carefully   as you guys can see those seeds on the inside it's  looking like it's going to have some heat and i'm   thinking it's going to pair pretty nicely with  these tacos and as you guys saw at the top of   this review they're advertising this as something  that's going to add additional flavor as it should   naturally but what about the heat so without  further ado let's get into it right now let me   pour a little bit on here and we'll give this a  go wow it's got a thickness to it actually pretty   nice let's give that a shot and i'll show you one  more time look at that it almost looks like it's   seriously pureed big time let's give it a go guys  the new green sauce here at taco bell let's do it mmm it's almost jelly like believe it or  not but lots of heat oh that is really nice   yeah distinctly different and i gotta say the  hatch chili's i think is what's standing out   the most above and beyond this really doesn't  taste like a kicked up jalapeno type of sauce   that i'm used to it's got a more of a jelly  like pureed consistency now again the puree   is coming from the jalapeno but that hatch chili  is adding just a little bit of extra to it guys   and it really is different i have to admit this is  not too bad let's go for a little bit more on this   let me try and keep that in focus guys it's very  jelly-like which i'm really digging there look at   that you can actually see some of that hanging  off there pretty crazy so far let's keep going i like it i like it a lot yeah and while it  does feel distinctly different let me go for   a little bit of my old standby really quick  just to kind of compare it actually and my   favorite over here is the fire sauce at  taco bell i'm a huge fan of their fire   sauce here let me just go for a little bit on  the inside just to compare it naturally it's   a little bit more watery compared to the  other but i'm really digging the overall   jelly-like consistency of that sauce it's a  little misleading when you see it because it   doesn't really seem like it's going to be like  that but as you pour it in or dip into something   you're going to notice it right away so a  little bit of fire sauce first let's do it different type of heat but watery nowhere near as  vibrant as that green sauce heat wise though and   almost be willing to bet it's a little bit below  the fire in terms of the intensity right away   but the steaminess and the overall flavor that i'm  getting from the fire roasted chilies the hatch   chilies and that pureed jalapeno on the green  sauce it's pretty banging guys it really is this   is not bad at all all right so let me set this  up for one more shot of this for you here just   so you guys can see again the consistency i'll  try and keep it in focus here but look at this   jelly-like consistency guys i am really digging  that look at how it's sitting on top of there   like a little shelf actually lots of pureed  goodness on this and distinctly different   is it worth 30 cents upgrade to actually  get this because that's what these cost   30 cents on the side and they are served  very warm in these little containers yes   i would definitely recommend getting  it because it's worth it if you've got   this on the menu give this one a shot one  more bite we'll finish this one up hang on yeah so this is easily worth the time guys and  like i said the hatch green chilies is the wild   card with this one in my opinion that flavor  is really really solid along with the pureed   jalapeno for added spice and naturally the little  extra chili action with the fire roasted green   chilies added into this you're getting a very  nice combination of heat and kicked up flavors   so this is easily worth the up charge for 30 cents  here at least in my taco bell and i have to admit   i would love to keep getting this on something  else over here this is really really tasty so   yeah technically for my very first hot sauce  type review from taco bell here on the channel   i'm gonna have to give the all new green sauce a  rock solid 9 out of 10 like i said this one   really delivers the only downside at least that i  can possibly see with this is the fact that there   is a little bit of an extra charge but what you  are getting are pretty premium ingredients again   the hatch chilis the pureed jalapeno and those  fire roasted green chilies on top of it guys   those are pretty premium as far as i'm concerned  still worth the time still worth checking out for   sure and if you're a fan of taco bell i would  recommend adding it considering this is also   one of the first new sauces they've added in a very long time i think it was the diablo sauce a few   years back and even before that there was hardly  anything it's been the main sauces for years   this is easily something i'd love to see stay  on the menu very very tasty all right so now the   all-important question does your local taco bell  offer this one drop some comments down below let   me know if you've seen this elusive green sauce  which is popping up in select markets across the   country i'm very curious to know if you've got it  available in your area and if you have given it a   shot what did you personally think drop those  comments down below and definitely let me know   and with that this is Ian K closing out another  high quality foodie feature for you here on peep   this out reviews bringing you brand new content
