 hey everyone welcome back to another high  quality foodie feature for you here on the   channel where this time i'm over at el pollo loco  to check out one of the new variations of nachos   they've got going on the menu that's right you  already know what it is it's the double chicken   nachos so stay tuned because it's up next to  peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty so here we go with the double chicken  nachos here at el pollo loco and initial   first impressions guys this looks like it  was kind of thrown together i mean there's   definitely a lot of food in here for sure but the  presentation is a little lackluster in my opinion   alright so what we've got here looks to be a very  decent portion of their tortilla chips topped off   with a double portion of their fire grilled  chicken but admittedly it looks a little on   the dry side but it is absolutely plentiful aside  from that this one looks to feature their queso   blanco which i'm not really seeing too much of  but we definitely have guacamole we've got some   beans some pico de gallo and absolutely some sour  cream is visible though it's very light in that   department as well and this is actually supposed  to come with a fried serrano pepper which i'm   also not seeing so so far guys this is really  not starting off great but at the same time it   does look pretty plentiful all right so let's  not waste any more time on this one let's see   if the flavor delivers this is the all new  double chicken nachos here at el pollo loco   let's peep out this flavor well i'm definitely  digging the portion size for the chicken itself   i just wish it looked a little juicier but guys i  got to be honest again while this does feel pretty   hefty in the hand and the toppings definitely are  plentiful i'm not really seeing a lot of cheese on   this at all you can kind of see this right here  it looks like it's more chips than anything and   it looks like they couldn't really spare the sour  cream either but hey it is what it is let me just   try and get a little bit of everything on here  and we'll just give this a shot i've had various   versions of nachos at el pollo loco over the  years i'm sure this is going to be very similar   let's give this a shot here guys the double  chicken nachos here at el pollo loco let's do it it's okay but unfortunately as expected the  chicken is very dry and in terms of the queso   blanco i am not really seeing too much of  that on here at all there is like literally   nothing in terms of cheese on here guys  it's very dry man this is not cool at all   let me try and go for a little bit of  guacamole a little bit of the cheese   action right here whatever i can get actually  there's really not too much of that on here this is totally front loaded there is nothing on  the very bottom here at all and literally like   no cheese very disappointing well i take that back  actually here hang on there is a little bit of   queso blanco but wow this is sad this is just sad  it's literally in specs along with the sour cream   there's really nothing here now let me grab a fork  real quick this is going to be a very quick review   this is very lackluster right now i'm really not  digging this considering $7.50 for this and granted   i mean i'm paying for the weight of everything  on here and the topping choices but even still   this is probably going to be the nicest bite i  can show you out of this group here because the   sour cream is just weak there's nothing here  let's go for one more bite this is pretty sad no i'm not going to waste your time or mine  anymore with this guys very very dry on the   chicken there's hardly any cheese to speak of on  this i don't have my serrano pepper to even try   that as well and overall just very lackluster  front loaded chips with very decent toppings   but not the freshest and it could have had  a lot more sour cream to go with as well   just pretty sad on this one it really is now as  most of you guys know especially if you've watched   my channel for any length of time in addition to  my live streams el pollo loco is one of the main   staples of my diet outside of what i usually do  for filming here on the channel i mean i love the   chicken the way that they make it i eat chicken  more than anything and i do get the chicken   pretty often over here but some of these promo  items especially with these nachos i'm always   a little leery about because it depends upon who  make them for you naturally this could have used   a lot more queso blanco a little bit more sour  cream and it could have been fresher for sure   but having something with a lot of toppings dumped  on the top with a whole bunch of chips and that's   it the presentation as soon as i opened it up  was kind of lackluster to begin with even though   it was plentiful but still it didn't deliver  obviously i think you know that right so with   that said and unfortunately i'm gonna have to give  the double chicken nachos based upon my experience   with them right now here at el pollo loco a 5.1  out of 10 it's just overpassable with this one   because the flavor is just okay but even still  the chicken could have been a lot juicier a lot   fresher and again we need some more queso blanco  that thing should have been lit up ridiculously   especially with all the other toppings the sour  cream it looks like somebody spit on it literally   there's really nothing on there at all even though  the guacamole was okay the beans were very light   as well just overall a lackluster effort today but  like i said just barely over the five mark barely   all right so i'm just going to ask you one very  simple question who do you think has the best fast   food nachos because the quality at el pollo loco  generally is pretty good but when it comes to   fast food nachos who do you think reigns supreme  drop some comments down below and definitely   let me know and with that this is Ian K closing  out another high quality foodie feature for you   here on peep this out reviews bringing you brand  new content every single week here on my channel   so while you stay tuned for that next review coming  real soon in the meantime stay frosty i expect a   lot more from you el pollo loco because i definitely  know what you're capable of i mean like i said i   do enjoy your food outside of my normal reviews  but when it comes to these promo nacho items at   the very least we need some more queso blanco on  this i mean come on all right guys until next time   i'll talk to you soon hey thanks for checking  out another one of my reviews but just in case   you didn't see the one before this one you can  find it right up over here along with what i   think
