 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty bk channels the spirit world this Halloween as it tempts the other side with their all-new ultra limited ghosts whopper and something tells me they're absolutely gonna answer the call so here we go with the all-new limited time only ghost whopper available at 10 select locations only across the country here at BK and I have to say the look of this one is very solid check out the white goodies on the very top there guys looking really nice with a slight contrast with the sesame seeds and this one is not all appearances it supposedly has got some white cheddar cheese flavor associated with it and I gotta say it looks really cool I'm not really smelling that but the appearance is awesome underneath it looks like we've got all the usual goodies of the whopper itself of course plenty of chopped lettuce we've got the Mayo of course you're gonna find ketchup pickles sliced white onions all that good stuff in there as well and that's all on top of 100% flame-grilled goodness from BK the beef of course and we lift this up plenty of pickles and ketchup as you can see there guys and a tomato is in there as well hiding but guys the bun is the main star of the show on this one and it looks really really great again no real aroma coming from the bun itself I'm really just smelling a very tasty whopper right now so let's see if this one is gonna deliver across the board because like I said it looks awesome it's the limited time only ghost whopper here at BK let's peep out this flavor well first off let me just say it's great being here in San Diego California right now this was about a two-hour drive from Pasadena all the way down this way and a very glad I was able to swing on down because this is relatively in my backyard and I'm really glad to finally be able to give this one a shot after hearing about it it looks really great so let's get into this one but like always first thing if you guys are fans of high quality delicious looking food reviews make sure to hit that subscribe button down below and don't forget to tap that Bell icon so you can be notified as soon as new content drops every week here we go is this gonna have some cheddar cheese flavor in the bun we're about to find out it's the limited edition ghost whopper here at bk mmm-hmm actually you know what it kind of does at the very end of the bite because of all the other overwhelming flavors of the whopper in a good way I might add because of all the flame grilled beef and all the veggies you get a little bit of that cheddar cheese flavor just very lightly at the end but let me keep going with the guys because it's tasty either way but I really want to get more of that flavor hang on mmm that's cool well this one obviously has all the obvious whopper flavors that you'd expect guys because it is a whopper afterall but the bun itself I have to admit is adding just a little bit to this one and you can actually distinctly taste just a little bit of extra cheesiness at the very end aside from the striking look which I really really like this is actually adding to the flavor for the first time and I think in a very long time an additional flavor on top of the regular ingredients of the whopper itself it's actually really cool on the real though what I'm thinking with this as I'm getting further into it is that the reason it doesn't have an initial cheese slice on it or any other type of cheese is because they really want you to taste that bun in addition to the flavors of the whopper itself although I got to admit having a white type of cheese or something extra on top of it I think would have been really really cool in general just for presentation but as it stands the bun has actually got something to it guys I'm very surprised let me actually try it by itself hang on yeah that is cool that is really cool let me grab another little piece here because I'm really diggin this it is really tasty yeah I really really like that and while this burger is ultra limited right now I think this bun really should be used down the line for some other types of burgers I gotta say guys it really does add something to the overall ingredients of the whopper but I like the idea that the flavor is noticeable especially when you try it on its own it's actually really good for some reason the flavor of that cheddar is actually richer as I'm getting further into this here so just to round this one out to give you guys another close-up of it obviously is all the whopper goodness here but as we go around let me just swing on top over here to give you a look at the bun this is not just for show it actually has some really really awesome flavor to it and I am really digging the overall quality of what its adding to the whopper itself please make more buns like this BK for other sandwiches because the flavored aspect of this particular one really highlight the goodies of the whopper with an additional cheesiness that I think a lot of people are gonna like it's really cool hey let me just say because I think most of you guys know I'm a huge fan of the marketing when it comes to these things the look of this particular burger on the window looks awesome on the poster but not just that the packaging that it comes in is also very cool it's got that ghost whopper logo on the outside and overall a very cool Halloween theme and just generally a good presentation inside and out so with that said I'm gonna have to give the ultra limited dose whopper here at BK a rock-solid 9 out of 10 the only way that I can really see to improve this one and this is really just something that I would like to see personally is adding a white cheese to this one like a white cheddar cheese sauce that would have been pretty amazing but I see what they're going with with this one the flavor of that bun stands out and of course it's all the Whopper goodies guys very very delicious this just needs to be in a lot more BK's across the country BK what are you doing to us bring this out nationwide now the obvious question is do you personally think this one should be nationwide drop those comments down below let me know what you think of the ghost whopper in general and if you're actually enticed by the idea of having a flavor infused type of bun of this caliber especially with cheddar cheese in it drop those comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K closing out another episode of peep this out bringing you brand new content every single week here on my channel so while you
