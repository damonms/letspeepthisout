 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty it's the latest King burger from BK and let me just say this one is most definitely appealing to my love of warm soft pretzels that's right so let's check out the all new pretzel bacon king and already I am super excited to get into this one guys this looks like a really authentic looking pretzel bun here complete with the splits on the very top it really has a very nice look to it nice softness it really does feel like it's an actual soft pretzel really really nice and it's fairly thick too let's pop the top and take a look on the inside looks like we have got some mustard we've got some mayo three full strips of hickory smoked bacon and that's all on top of a half pound of flame grilled beef on this one guys and it also includes four slices of American cheese it's definitely very gluttonous but it looks fantastic let's see if we can go for a little split on the very side here and lift this open a lot of the cheese is in the middle and the very top it looks like there is nothing on the bottom and that's okay because we've got that pretzel goodness on there as well too so really really cool guys kind of a basic build almost like the regular bacon king minus the ketchup but a lovely situation as you can see here this is looking like it's gonna be really really nice the smell of mustard is very strong in the air and you can really smell the difference in the bread with this actually pretzel bun being what it is here but it looks really fantastic can't wait to sink my teeth into this one it's the all new pretzel bacon King brand new here at BK let's peep out this flavor yeah this thing is pretty glorious looking guys and the smell like I said is absolutely awesome you can really smell how authentic this pretzel bun is on top of the mustard the combination goes amazingly well already and I haven't even taken the first bite yet but before I do and like always if you guys are fans of high quality delicious looking

into this let's go for the bite it's the pretzel bacon King brand new here at BK mmm man already sorry to talk with my mouth full with that one real quick guys but that is a huge blast of beef and cheese right up front and in the texture that I'm getting from the actual pretzel bun immediately comes through with the mustard so the combination is a beautiful situation a little bit of the Hickory bacon coming up on the back end there's a decent amount on here about three or so slices that the combination is tasty guys let's keep going mmm it's almost like the skin of the pretzel bun itself is popping off the top there so you can really taste the quality of what you're getting with this one it's nice and thick nice and hearty and it really does feel like when these buns were prepared they were boiled first as they should be and then baked so they can rise up even more guys but I'm really diggin the quality of this overall and of course it's all the classic stuff in the middle there from BK that familiar flame grilled flavor the half pound of beef the two patties lots of cheese four slices and of course the bacon and mayo is in there slightly but it's the mustard that's really standing out with it just a really tasty burger oh and did I mention how I really loved soft pretzels it's one of my all-time favorites especially dipping it into gooey cheese so the fact that you're getting a lot of cheese with this on top of it is just a bonus to me so that quality is there the familiarity is there the flavor is there and overall I just love the look of it I mean the top of the bun is really really cool looking even the bottom of it guys I mean this is a full-on pretzel bun and a very thick one it fits the patties perfectly and I have to admit the flavor just delivers to keep going with it mmm it's just so soft so good I got to say I'm diggin this pretzel bun so much I would really love to see a breakfast variant of it can you imagine like a bacon egg and cheese or even like a ham a sausage all the usual stuff but with the pretzel bun itself that's got to be the next thing it's just got to be because the quality of this is pretty insane really delicious but aside from that the fact that it's a bacon king variant using the nice pretzel bun goodness here I'm really diggin the fact that the bacon is really standing out the saltiness that I'm getting from that hickory-smoked goodness goes amazingly well with that type of toastiness and the softness of the pretzel bun itself and again naturally the mustard it's really classic guys it really is if you're a fan even in the slightest of pretzels soft pretzels in general you have a lot to look forward to with this one and of course all the flame grilled goodness from BK come on now it's delicious stuff mmm so let's go a little 360 action here before we round this one out as always a very nice situation with these king burgers they're very hearty very meaty very cheesy and the fact that this high-quality pretzel bun covers the patties perfectly is really a highlight on top of the mustard the light mayo everything with this one I'm not even really a fan of mayo but the mustard is really standing out plenty of the bacon the cheese is awesome and it really simulates I think what a soft pretzel in some gooey cheese has to offer with the flame grilled goodness from BK just a nice sandwich and I gotta say guys super delicious but I think you know that by now right well I made it to about the halfway point of this pretzel bacon king right now and I gotta say I am completely stuffed right now the fact that the pretzel bun is as thick as it is is not a bad thing whatsoever any other normal type of bun I would have been like that's a no bueno situation but with the quality of the pretzel bun being what it is and the fact that it's a pretzel bun period guys that's a highlight on top of it with the mustard the cheese the beef you've heard me talk about it at nauseam at this point it's a delicious burger and if you're a fan of pretzels like I said you have a lot to look forward to it's a delicious cheeseburger just on its own so with that said I'm gonna have to give the pretzel bacon King here at BK the obvious 10 out of 10 this one delivers on everything it's advertising the quality is there the taste is there the overall flavor of everything combined is a beautiful situation and guys it's a bacon king you can taste plenty of the bacon awesome stuff now of course the obvious question is do you think this looks pretty awesome drop some comments down
