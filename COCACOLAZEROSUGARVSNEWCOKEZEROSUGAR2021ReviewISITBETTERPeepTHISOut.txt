 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty what's going on everyone and welcome back to  another high quality foodie feature for you here   on the channel this time with the official sequel  to a comparison review that i did about three or   so years ago at the infamous pasadena bridge and  as you can see on your screen here right now guys   it was the then upgraded coke zero formula  compared to the older version on the market   and spoiler alert given the fact that i really  enjoyed that variation of the upgraded formula   and actually the can itself too there which  is really cool we've actually got a brand new   variant which is supposedly now more delicious and  guys i gotta admit i like this can a lot better   it's like the reverse color scheme with this  one here it's simple but it easily stands out   and i'm definitely digging that zero sugar  on this variation and again supposedly more   delicious and i can't wait to really see if it  is truly more delicious because that variation   that i tried back then was pretty tasty guys it  really felt like it was a little bit closer to   regular coke the sweetness was definitely elevated  still zero sugar and zero calories on this as well   so very curious to see how the new variation is  gonna go with this here so how this is gonna go   just like before i'm actually gonna pop the top  on this we're gonna pour some into a clear cup   i'm gonna taste it both ways we'll do the  same with the new variation and hopefully   maybe we'll see a difference i'm very curious  to see how sweet that new one's going to be   round one fight all right so let's get started  on this one let's pop the top on this one here   we've got a nice situation of frosty goodness  on the top you can kind of see it right there   let me go for a little core action for you  we'll just keep putting it in it's a tall   cup here naturally the same color let's give  this a shot i've actually got some green tea   on the side here to clean the palette as well  before we get into the next one let's give this   a shot first with the original upgraded version  about three years ago of coke zero first hang on nice it tastes very much like coke very sweet   but a little bit more foamy on that one  there but even still the color is definitely   on point it looks the part naturally the  flavor let's go for it in the cup itself tasty i mean it's the same naturally  you may get a different experience   drinking directly from the can compared to  a cup obviously from the can i think and   also a glass bottle would have been  cool as well let's go for one more i like it i really like it to me there's really  no difference compared to what i remember from   the last time out and i've had coke zero a few  times over the years since that time and the   flavor definitely feels a lot sweeter a lot more  like regular coke but apparently i guess some more   improvement was needed but even still guys this  is still very much like coke to me and i like the   fact that obviously it's zero sugar but you're  still getting the essence of a strong strong   coke flavor in this one especially on the sugary  end and this has no sugar which is crazy but cool   so definitely a banging situation either way and  actually you can probably find this in the stores   still they're probably going to blow out the  original stock before they move over completely   to the new variation which is what i saw in my  store they basically had a few of these on top   and a whole bunch of the old on the bottom but as  you can see again i'm really digging the can round   two fight now more delicious on this one let's pop  it and see what's going on with this and still   all that frosty goodness in there  let's go for a little pour on this one   and this one definitely feels like it is  the same action right there here we go   the upgraded formula already three years later  for coke zero coca-cola zero sugar however you   wanna call it let's go for a sip from this  and then we'll get into the cup here we go hang on a second another one wow i'm conflicted right now the sweetness is  not apparent up front with this one it almost   feels like a muted type of coke believe it  or not i'm not getting a very sweet flavor   from this but the essence of coke is there but  it doesn't really feel as foamy either hang on i am not getting this as more delicious to be  honest wow are you serious you know what hold   on one second i probably should have done this  before i jumped into the new version of the coke   let me take a sip of the tea real quick just to  fully clean the palette i'll go for this again all right let's try this again another one it doesn't really make a difference  wow that is really interesting so far   okay let me go for a little  bit of this one here in the cup   so far i'm a little underwhelmed guys  i'm a little underwhelmed hang on no man that's crazy it's a flatter version of coke  i mean there's a little bit of sweetness there   but it's not in your face upfront apparent like  the other one which is crazy so hang on one second i am not feeling that let's  go for the original less   upgraded variation the original one hang on do it this has more flavor this has more of the  pseudo fake flavor i would say of what a   regular coke should taste like that's  really interesting to me right now just   do it yeah it's got a little bit more of the  upfront sweetness that i would get from a regular   coke as well especially the mexican variant  which is my favorite from the glass bottles   guys this so far actually i still think is the  better formula so now let me go for the tea again okay all gone let's keep going no no i think this is a step backwards i really  do i mean i love the can but the flavor is not in   your face up front like this is coke i don't want  to say it tastes like a fake version of coke like   an off brand but i got to be real this is feeling  very off-brand to me right now it really is   this is torture man i am super disappointed right  now okay one more with the cup itself here and i   think i'm gonna call it but man another one yeah  no this is not this is a no bueno situation for   me it really is a no bueno situation i like  this formula i think i may have to stock up   more on the original upgraded variation from three  years ago which took the place of what i thought   was a pretty tasty version of coke zero to begin  with and actually migrating it to this one here   i am not feeling this one here guys now more  delicious it's got all the same information on   the back potassium 60 milligrams two percent  it's pretty much the exact same label but   really a very different type of drink i mean i  love the can i almost wish actually i do wish all   the contents that were in this can is actually  in the new can that's what they need to do   but i am not feeling this variation of zero  sugar coca-cola with this one um i'm not   feeling this at all for like the second upgraded  version of this since it's come out originally   no bueno i'm surprised this one made it past any  type of testing they did whatever focus group   they did but this one definitely feels like it is  so much sweeter finish him all right so i'm not   gonna waste any more time with this one jumping  right to the rating i'm gonna have to give the   quote-unquote all-new version of coke zero a very  lackluster 5 out of 10 it barely rates guys i   got to be honest with you this really tastes like  an off-brand version of coke almost like a shasta   believe it or not nothing against shasta naturally  but you know when you're having a regular coke a   real coke compared to something that's not like  an off-brand this does not taste anything like   coke zero to me much less regular coke compared  to say that version i mean i really like this one   like i said i wish the contents of this recipe  this formula was in the brand new can because i   think the can is cool i love the update i love  the toughness of it i love the coke logo i love   the black fonting and everything there it's cool  but the flavor is nowhere near like the original   formula why they decided to switch this i don't  know maybe it's a reason to see how this one does   maybe to go back to the other one so we can do a  part three variation review but even still guys   no bueno whatsoever 5 is a generous score  right now because like i said it doesn't taste   like coke that i'm used to anyway but the flavor  is okay it's very mild but again a flat version   of coke is what it is very little carbonation  compared to that these are both ice cold and   like i said just a no bueno situation all right  so with all that said i'm just gonna simply ask   you guys have you tried this new version of coke  zero yet drop some comments down below let me know   what your experience has been compared to say the  other version of coke zero which has been around   for the last few years and prior to that a whole  bunch of years with the original formula of coke   zero which i thought was pretty fine as well i was  pretty addicted to it back then but guys as far as   i'm concerned this is a step backwards at least  for the brand personal opinion but like i said   they really should stick with that current version  of coke zero in the black can just put that into   the red can and call it a day i really hope they  do that i really do all right and with that this   is Ian K closing out another high quality foodie  feature for you here on peep this out reviews   bringing you brand new content every single  week here on my channel so while you stay tuned for   that next review coming real soon in the meantime  stay frosty i'm definitely digging the can as   you've heard me say throughout this review but  it's what's on the inside that counts and for me   i'm already looking forward to the next variation  of coke zero you know it's coming i have a feeling   it may be less than three years from now all  right guys until next time i'll talk to you soon   hey thanks for checking out another one
