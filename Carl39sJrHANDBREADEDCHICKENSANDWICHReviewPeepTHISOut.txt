 what's going on everyone welcome back to  another high quality foodie feature for   you here on the channel where this time i'm  over at carl's jr to check out their entry   into the ongoing chicken sandwich wars and  judging by the promo poster on their window   i gotta say their version's looking pretty nice  so here we go with the simply named hand breaded   chicken sandwich and already i'm digging the  size of this potato bun guys this is looking   pretty nice already definitely sizeable let's pop  it and take a look underneath and it looks like   i've got just a little dab of mayo on the very top  there but take a look at the main star of the show   and all white meat hand breaded chicken breast filet  that's dusted in southern spicing i gotta say guys   this is looking pretty nice it's not too large not  too small kind of in between but it looks pretty   nice in the appearance department and obviously  the hand breaded goodness is standing out underneath   it looks like we've got three deli pickles and  some more mayo on the bottom but guys coming back   to the chicken itself the quality definitely looks  pretty nice at least in the appearance department   i just wish it was a little bit thicker so let's  see if the flavor is going to deliver on this one   this is the all-new hand-breaded chicken sandwich  here at carl's jr let's peep out this flavor   well now that i'm holding it in my hand it's  definitely on the thinner side i mean the bun   is pretty sizable but it's not really being filled  out as much as i'd like here considering the price   point for this one guys $7.69 for this so it is  not competitive in the price department at all but   even still the quality of the chicken is looking  pretty good and those pickles they look pretty   fantastic as well here we go it's the all-new hand  breaded chicken sandwich here at carl's jr let's   do it chicken's juicy not bad yeah the hand breaded goodness  makes such a difference on this going forward and   i can easily see why everybody is adopting the  hand breaded route when they go with the chicken   sandwiches now the quality is high it's juicy i'm  not really getting any spicing anything above and   beyond like a nice fried flavor but even still the  juiciness is there and that's the main highlight   for me so far aside from the pickles let's go  for another bite i'll give you a close-up not bad well aside from the nice juiciness of that white  meat fillet i'm really digging the fact that the   coating itself is not overly abundant enough where  it's going to drown out the flavor of the chicken   the juiciness and the flavor of the chicken is  really standing out but it's got almost like a   flash fry type of quality in terms of the coating  it's not overly breaded and i think that's what's   lending to the fact that it's making the chicken  feel a little small in this bun right now but   again the pickles are really jumping out and  that quality is really nice as well yeah the   fact that it doesn't have a lot of breading on  it is really lending to the fact that it feels   like it's a little bit smaller than it should be  i think had this been maybe double or maybe triple   breaded like a really huge fried chicken sandwich  would have been really cool but even still i don't   think it complements the size of the bun too well  but the quality of the chicken is good so i'm   kind of conflicted in terms of how i feel about  this right now aside from the price point being   almost eight bucks so not competitive in that  department but still the quality of the chicken   is good so let's go for a couple more bites guys  because this is not a bad chicken sandwich at all   i just wish it was a little bit larger considering  the type of bun that it's on let's keep going in yeah i'm definitely digging the pickles with this  i mean i like pickles in general and that goes so   well with fried chicken because the acidity the  snap and the crunch along with the coating the   juiciness of the chicken it's a nice combination  but guys and as i'm getting further into this you   know what i'm beginning to think this is very  similar to the nashville hot chicken sandwich i   did from boston market not that long ago it's not  nearly as hot as that or having any type of spice   but the appearance is very similar i'll make  sure that's jumping up on your screen right   now so you can take a look and let me know down  below in the comments if you agree with that   but even still i like the quality of the chicken  i think it's made well it's juicy i wish it was   just a little bit bigger but in terms of the price  point this needs to be at least $3.99 $4.99 tops it is   not competitive price wise but even still nice  quality all right so let's go for one more bite   on this one we'll close it up after the rating  but guys yet another chicken sandwich variant   that you have to choose from when it comes to fast  food there is a ton of them out there and believe   me i've done literally almost all of them at this  point let's go for another bite we'll finish it up well let's just go around the world with this one  because i'll show you more of what i'm talking   about here take a look there is nothing really in  the back of the bun so the chicken itself needs to   be a little bit bigger i have a feeling with these  hand breaded chicken breast fillets your mileage   may vary some maybe a little bit smaller so maybe  a little bit larger but even still the quality is   pretty nice the juiciness is good the coating is  light and like i said overall the price is just   a little too high for this that's really the main  thing aside from everything else so with that said   i'm going to have to give the all-new hand breaded  chicken sandwich here at carl's jr a pretty solid   8.1 out of 10 now it may seem a little high for  some of you guys considering the price being so   high as well but like i said the quality of the  chicken itself is really pretty tasty just the   right amount of saltiness it's not overly breaded  so you can really taste the nice juiciness and the   overall quality of the chicken i just wish like i  said there was more of a balance of maybe a little   bit more of that to complement the bun that it's  on i mean just a bigger chicken fillet would have   just satisfied overall and made me feel like i  wasn't getting as ripped off considering the price   point being what it is i know it's west coast  pricing but guys even still if you're trying to   be competitive in the fast food chicken sandwich  wars anything over $3.99 is a stretch especially if   you're not coming with it in the size department  just saying all right so I'd venture to guess if   you've made it this far into the review you're  most likely going to be giving this one a shot   if you've got carl's jr in the area or maybe  even hardees because naturally it's available   with them as well do me a quick favor drop some  comments down below if you do give this one a go   how was the size of the chicken for your sandwich  when you got it was a little bit larger was it   smaller were you satisfied overall drop some  comments down below and definitely let me know   and with that this is Ian K closing out another  high quality foodie feature for you here on   peep this out reviews bringing you
