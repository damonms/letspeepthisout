 hey everyone welcome back to another high  quality foodie feature for you here on the   channel where this time i'm over in fullerton  california at a test location for taco bell to   check out a couple of new items they've got  going on the menu so stay tuned because the   crispy cheese dippers are up next welcome to  peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty so here we go with the currently in test crispy  cheese dippers and initial first impressions they   are definitely bite-sized guys a very very small  container here just a little bit bigger than the   sauce that they come with actually i gotta say  this is looking pretty tiny but as you can see   on the inside we've got a nine piece order of  what's supposed to be real cheddar cheese curds   that are rolled in a tortilla chip coating  and then fried to a crispy golden brown so   they're looking pretty decent guys i have to  admit you can actually see the tortilla pieces   on the outside it's definitely looking nice and  crispy so i'm really hoping that cheesy goodness   on the inside is going to combine to be a really  flavorful little item here but for dipping just   in case we've got some creamy chipotle sauce and i  have to admit this looks really like classic taco   bell in nice situation indeed nice and creamy  and i'm definitely looking forward to getting   into this right now yeah i know this is a test  but already i'm kind of hoping these are going   to be just a little bit bigger because just when  you hold the container up you can't even really   see anything is on the inside unless you dip  it forward and as you can see looking nice and   crispy they definitely look pretty solid they look  the part for sure but they are really pretty much   cheddar cheese curds because they're small guys  look at this this is almost like popcorn chicken   and it is really really tiny let me try and bite  into a little half of this first and then we'll   get it going it's the currently in test crispy  cheese dippers here at taco bell let's do it it's just all right the cheese is not bad though  and admittedly i probably should have started off   with maybe a bigger piece on the inside because  there's really not a lot going on in the inside   of this although the flavor of the cheese is not  bad and as you can see there it is fairly coated   but as you can see it's more crispy coating than  anything else let's just keep going it's nice   though the tortilla flavor is there but again this  really does kind of smack of like popcorn chicken   but without the protein on the inside but the  crispy coating is really the highlight with this   one guys take a look at that up close there again  a lovely situation as you can see the tortilla   is pretty nice on the outside you can see those  crumbles pretty well and honestly this looks like   a two for one here right now maybe that's why it's  kind of big like that let's go for another bite it was a two for one technically ten pieces i  guess i have on the inside of this container   instead of nine but i like it it's crispy  it's fried a little bit of cheesy goodness   on the inside and again you can kind of see  in there they're little cheddar cheese by it's   more like jalapeno popper action but without the  jalapeno but again just okay so let's go for a dip   inside this creamy chipotle action here right  now give this a shot we'll kick it up a bit   i'm sure this is going to be lovely with all  the fried goodness on the outside let's try it instantly creamy chipotle is banging it's  kind of like what they use in the quesadillas   it goes amazing with the crispy outer coating of  these these are actually really good with this   mmm really good let's go for a little bit more try  and show as much of this as i can for you because   it's just all right it kind of  reminds me of the crispy chicken   that they did back in the day but obviously  with a little cheese on the inside so   i like the idea of the concept they need to be  just a little bit bigger though because when these   things cook i'm sure they shrink up instantly  which is what i got here right now pretty small   the cheese is good though sharp it's got  a very rich rich flavor a little sharpness   to it there but take a look on the inside  you can kind of see a little bit of a nug   of cheese there but a lovely situation on this  guy is not bad for a snack $2.99 though i think   it's a little much to ask for this if you double  the amount in the container it's probably worth   it but i wouldn't go much above like a buck 50  buck 99 tops for something like this but you   are getting their trademark chipotle sauce here  which is really delicious and i absolutely love   that let's just go for another little dunk on  this one here real quick for you nice situation   on this guys a nice little poppable snack with  some taco bell flair you can't hate on that so yeah definitely a tasty poppable snack  for sure with that taco bell flair but again   a little on the small side for what these are  on the inside take a look at the very bottom of   the container one more time here guys i would  recommend giving these a shot if you guys have   this available in your area right now in fullerton  this is something to absolutely try the cheesy   goodness is pretty solid but again a little on  the small side for the price point but again that   creamy chipotle sauce goes pretty nicely with it  as you'd expect it to right so with that said i'm   going to have to give the currently in test crispy  cheese dippers here at taco bell just in okay   7 out of 10 these are just alright guys i mean  it's a poppable snack they are definitely going to   satisfy because they actually are very flavorful  that outer coating with the tortilla goodness   really does shine through and it comes alive  with the creamy chipotle as you'd expect it to   anything fried with a little bit of heat on top of  it and the creaminess is pretty awesome but again   the size is a little on the small side and if they  can just beef that up just a little bit i think   they have a serious winner aside from knocking  the price down just a little bit considering   what these go for right now i mean $2.99 is a lot  to ask for nine little pieces like that a buck   50 buck 99 tops final verdict all right so now the  all-important question if you happen to live close   to the location where they're doing this test  market right now which also happens to be the same   location that i reviewed their crispy wings back  in the day that was pretty amazing as well take a   look at that review popping up on your screen here  right now with that in mind are you going to be   jumping over to this test location
