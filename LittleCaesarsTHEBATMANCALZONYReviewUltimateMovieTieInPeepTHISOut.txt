 hey everyone welcome or welcome  back to the channel it's Ian K   and this time i'm over at little caesars because  it looks like they've got an awesome looking   movie tie-in promo with my all-time favorite  comic book character that's right and i gotta   say this thing looks pretty awesome so stay  tuned because the batman calzony is up next   welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay  frosty pizza pizza man this is a truly special   day so are you ready because i definitely am i am  completely decked out for this event here right   now guys here we go the batman calzony from little  caesars i am so digging the presentation with this   it is spot on the bat symbol in all of its glory  a very cool looking product and i gotta admit   probably the ultimate tie-in that you can actually  eat definitely looking pretty awesome on this all   right so very simply what we've got here looks to  be their standard calzony with the left and right   sides flared out a little bit just to give you a  little open face look to simulate those wings guys   but the top and bottom are looking pretty awesome  so essentially it's transformed into a bat-shaped   hybrid pizza that features a calzone-like crust on  the top and bottom and that's actually filled at   the ends there with garlic white sauce cheese and  julienne pepperoni basically little chunks little   slivers i should say a pepperoni at the ends there  and then naturally in the middle regular pepperoni   there's standard marinara and of course the cheese  blend but guys a very lovely situation because it   really simulates the batman symbol pretty nicely  and again i'm calling it the ultimate movie tie-in   that you can eat with this one this is looking  really really great for dipping of course it's   going to come with a side of crazy sauce so of  course we're going to get into that but guys   again i am so over the moon with the presentation  of this this is just looking really really awesome   and in perfect timing for batman obviously this  tie-in is absolutely killer already yeah so like   many of you i'm sure you're looking forward to the  movie coming out march 4th but guys again a very   cool presentation and i was completely blown away  when i saw this one coming out and i got to say   again it really is spot on the batman symbol that  you can eat it is so so cool so let me put this   down on the car again pizza in the car is always a  challenge but i'm up for it let's give this a shot   i'm actually going to pull one of these pieces off  of the pizza itself first just to give you an idea   of what we're working with here this is going  to be the standard pepperoni goodness of course   the nice toasty ends on the bottom i should say  they're looking pretty nice let's just start   off with this and work our way up to the goodness  that is the calzone-like crust in the back hang on standard pepperoni pizza from little  caesars i'm not hating on it it's tasty   the quality of the pepperoni is good the standard  marinara the cheesy goodness of course a very   lovely situation as you can see it's nice and  crispy right there at the ends i'm really digging   how this is made the back of it is feeling kind of  buttery in my hands right now i think i'm getting   a little bit of the offshoot of that buttery  parmesan-like garlic goodness that this has   got as well is actually in the calzone but on the  pizza itself a little spillover i'm cool with it   considering i'm having one of the wings of the  bat symbol here right now let's keep going in tasty i love pizza it's my favorite any time of  the day i can eat this so good and because i've   got it here on my trusty little tray underneath  me i am actually going to go in for some crazy   sauce real quick because that actually is  a highlight of course let's keep going in extra goodness so what do you guys think of  the newest trailer out for the batman right   now i mean it's looking absolutely fantastic  robert pattinson i think exemplifies the role   in costume it's an early version of him naturally  in the comic but i am so digging the way that the   story is going so far i think that was saying  that riddler is fashioned off of the zodiac killer   so it's got almost like a horror movie vibe  going with it so definitely digging that guys   really looking forward to the movie obviously  i'm ready for it let's just keep going in oh and did i mention i love pizza  you guys already know what it is i   can definitely do this any time of the  day like i was saying let's just knock   off this last piece and of course we're  gonna get into that calzone goodness next this is so good i just wish it was a little  heated that's the only thing it's a little cold   but still tasty last bite and real quick if you guys want to check out my  review of the original calzony that i did actually   a few months ago take a look at that review  popping up on your screen here right now that   was a lot of fun to check out it's the cheese  variant so naturally i wanted to go in with a   classic pepperoni because obviously it makes sense  considering i did the cheese the last time out so   let me pick up one of these pieces of that calzony  and guys this is already looking pretty awesome   take a look at that there a nice little shot  of the hybrid pizza action and of course in the   very back those julienne pepperoni actions right  over there as well garlic buttery goodness some   parmesan and that white sauce that you can  kind of see there as well the garlicky white   sauce this is looking really really tasty but i  want to go for one more bite right there in the   middle actually of that pepperoni goodness  because it looks too good not to hang on the middle is so good little  doughy oh man i like that   and because i have to we're going for a little  dip in that crazy sauce action really good here i'm like having lunch with you guys right here on  camera man i still can't get over i am eating a   batman logo shaped pizza right now in the car this  is probably the ultimate type of food to simulate   something like this you're not going to see  anything better as much i'm calling it right now   maybe some of the times with maybe some glasses  things like that actually have batman's face or   the logos or something on them but a food item  guys you can't get much better than pizza that   thing is like perfect and a natural extension of  the regular calzony i mean and there was really   nobody else as far as i'm concerned that could  have pulled something like this off personally   than little caesars because they already  had it going already with the calzone so   take a look at it one more time we're gonna  go for a bite of this one again i'm losing a   piece of pepperoni there but it's all good i'm  protected very very slick let's give it a go oh buttery garlic parmesan saltiness julienne  pepperoni that white sauce oh my god this thing   is awesome i don't want this to leave the menu  and thankfully with this promo it's going to be   here for at least a month plus i would think up  until the movie comes out maybe shortly after   this is so delicious right now guys so delicious  wow hashtag unsponsored the quality is definitely   banging on this one this calzony is definitely  a bomb situation let's go for a little bit of   that crazy sauce action here keep that kind of  focused in cheesy goodness guys cheesy goodness mmm   oh my god i love this thing i love it it is  so good in fact i'm thinking the movie   is probably going to be even better  than this and this is pretty banging   right now guys the movie trailer just looks  absolutely amazing i can't wait for the film   march 4th get your tickets as soon as they're  available for sure take a look at this one   more time here maybe two more times we're gonna  finish this piece out i am loving this right now   just a very tasty treat with batman  thrown into the mix pretty banging he has some awesome hybrid pizza action featuring  a calzone at the very end or calzone like i should   say and considering this one's actually a  little bit less expensive than the regular   calzone i think it was like 50 cents more to  get the regular you're technically getting   only two types of calzones here at either end  so four total as opposed to six the last time   out i believe you're getting two on either  end and in the middle is the pepperoni pizza   i don't mind that so much at all because like  i said what you're getting here looks cool it   tastes delicious it's virtually the same  thing and again the marketing looks really   really slick with this guys the box itself very  slick and obviously it just presents very nicely   all right so let me knock off this tiny little  piece that's left over here and of course we   will wrap up my final thoughts of this one  here in just a second but guys delicious   stuff all around and again very very fun to  check out right now definitely banging mmm pizza pizza yeah definitely a lot of fun to check  out and with me being a huge fan of the marketing   when it comes to these items i have to say that is  spot on so i'm actually going to rate this based   upon the marketing aspect alone because like i  said i've already reviewed the original calzony   so you know exactly how i feel about this one to  begin with on top of me just enjoying the batman   variation of it right now again take a look at  that review in the upper right hand corner of   your display from my further thoughts of that  but when it comes to concept-wise for what this   is guys how could i not give this a 10 out of  10 given the fact that this actually looks the   part on top of tasting like that classic calzone  to begin with so all they really had to do with   this was simply flare out the ends and there you  go you've got the bad symbol essentially guys they   really did a nice job molding that and again like  i said earlier there is no better type of food to   go in on with something like this than pizza they  can do a lot of different things to make it look   like your favorite comic book characters logos  especially and with that one looking just like   the bat i'm down with it come on guys you already  know what it is all right so do me a quick favor   because naturally if you've made it this far  into the review i already know you're either   a batman fan a little caesars fan possibly both  like myself do me a fast favor again drop some   comments down below let me know what your  thoughts are on the new batman film when it   comes out or what your thoughts are leading  up to it as well as what you thought of the   presentation of this one this batman calzony is no  joke guys it's really really awesome not just in   presentation but also in the flavors so drop those  comments down below and definitely let me know   and with that this is Ian K closing out another  high quality foodie feature for you here on peep   this out reviews bringing you brand new content  every single week here on my channel so while you stay   tuned for that next review coming real soon  in the meantime stay frosty all right little   caesars you've got a really cool thing going  when it comes to the new batman film with this   one but if you really want to take it up a notch  how about doing like a big question mark calzone   itself there for the riddler that would be cool  just the calzone portion of this pizza alone   that i think visually would look pretty  banging just to kind of match up with this one   alright guys until next time i'll talk to you  soon hey thanks for checking out another one of   my reviews but just in case you didn't see the one  before this one you can find it right up over here   along what i think youtube's gonna recommend  for you to check out as well as always i think   you'll find something to like in both of them and  i'll definitely catch you in the next one see ya
