 hey everyone welcome back to another high  quality foodie feature for you here on the   channel where this time i'm over at el pollo  loco and it looks like i'm about to go to   school because it's all about their new local  lunch box so stay tuned because it's up next   welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty so here we go with the cheesy chicken quesadilla  loco lunch box from el pollo loco and i gotta say   guys this is a pretty substantial amount of food  for $6.99 i'm definitely digging the presentation   of this one especially the box it comes in  so starting off with the quesadilla itself   what we've got here is a large flour tortilla nice  and toasty and on the inside fire grilled chicken   coming from the thigh meat actually along with  melted jack cheese definitely a lovely situation   three large triangles as you can see here and  they look fairly packed nice and meaty for sure   you've got your choice of side to go with this  here and i decided to keep it traditional by   going for some beans and rice a lovely situation  there and of course on the side for a little extra   crunch we've got a side of their famous tortilla  chips along with some guacamole a lovely situation   and some pico if you want to go that route  and for dessert guys take a look at one of   their churros here this is a fairly large churro  as well rolled in cinnamon and sugar as always   and i gotta say it is definitely sizable lovely  situation so let's get into this guys it's   the cheesy chicken quesadilla loco lunch box  here at el pollo loco let's peep out this flavor   yeah definitely a substantial amount of  food for $6.99 guys i'm already impressed   because of what you're getting with this box  to begin with but when you consider their main   chicken quesadillas alone are usually in  the four to five dollar range give or take   that's a pretty banging value for $6.99 so starting  off with the obvious here let's take a look at one   of the main stars of the show with this one here  a lovely situation nice and toasty on the outside   a simple build on this one just some of their  thigh meat on the inside and some shredded jack   cheese let's just give this a go guys I'm very  excited to bite into this it's the cheesy   chicken quesadilla part of the all new loco  lunch boxes here at el pollo loco let's do it basic but tasty thick yes yeah you can't fade the  chicken over here at el pollo loco especially   the dark meat one of my favorite types of  chicken meat guys and i gotta say this is   very very chunky on the inside just like they say  here it is a very nice amount of chicken there the   jack cheese is nice and melted as well and of  course you got the nice toastiness to go around   just a very tasty quesadilla it's a  simple build but a flavorful one at   that let's go for another bite and we'll  get into a couple of other things here i am definitely digging that and i'm glad i got  three large pieces of this too it's pretty good   and while you're going in on your quesadilla of  course you want to go for some of their chips here   and naturally you've got a nice side of uh pureed  guacamole is what this kind of looks like here   let me try and focus that in for you as much  as i can there we go we'll go for a little   dip action just a little bit a little difficult  to do this way but you get the idea here we go nice little bit of heat on that just  a little bit but the flavor is rich   it's more like avocado salsa actually  but i'm really digging the quality   and yeah it's got some heat  to it definitely got some heat yup fresh tortilla chips as well a decent amount  in the bag which i'm very happy about as well too   usually with these combos they skimp on all the  items around it because it's the main item and   they kind of throw little things into the side but  everything is very decently sized here including   that churro which we're going to get to in a  little bit pretty nice mmm yeah really good and   honestly guys as much as i love the mac and cheese  over here at el pollo loco i wanted to keep it traditional   but just going by what they advertise with it  there so the beans and the rice action here   a lovely situation these seem a little salty to  me whenever i get them let me try and do this   as careful as possible there we'll keep that  focused in but they're famous rice and beans   it's in pretty much everything that they make here  burrito wise mmm very good but just a little salty   salt equals flavor and this is actually  not bad so lemme try and do this carefully as   well for you and keep that focus as you can see  traditional stuff you gotta love it tasty tasty   mmm yeah really good let me do one more bite  on that actually this is really tasty right now yeah i'm glad i got this right now it goes pretty  nicely with that quesadilla traditional flavors of   course overall and because we're not quite there  at dessert just yet let me bring up the quesadilla   one more time i'm going to try and focus that  in just a little bit for you focus there we go   a little bit of trouble today a little contrasty  because of the weather outside but as you can see   nice and meaty again full of  cheesy goodness on the inside   and i love the crispiness of that flour  tortilla on the outside as well pretty lovely mmm yeah digging this so while i'm staring at  this right now with all the cheesy goodness on the   inside what are your favorite types of quesadillas  do you like like a beef quesadilla do you like   chicken quesadillas or maybe just straight  quesadillas with cheese only drop those comments   down below and let me know what your personal  favorite go-to is here but i gotta say for el   pollo loco this is actually pretty tasty right now  it is yup definitely a banging situation on that   and for dessert just to round this one out here  as i'm giving you a little tour of this lunch   box again guys look at the size of this churro  here trying to keep that focused away from my   face there so you can see it's cinnamon sugar  goodness usually this is about half the size   when you get these at fast food restaurants  but that is pretty awesome look at that it   takes up your whole screen right now lovely  situation on this guys let's go for a quick bite or two or three because this is pretty banging  right now wow crunchy crispy just the right amount   of sugar the fried goodness on the inside of this  one really standing out guys look at this here   try and focus that as much as i can  for you come on catch it there you go   look at that lovely situation you know i'm all  about the details here in my reviews trying to   give you as much goodness as i possibly can here  but this is really nice guys just a nice accent   with everything else on here and i didn't even  get a drink if you wanted to get a drink it was   like eight bucks after tax as well still not bad  value for everything this is a fully featured meal   that you're getting with this one and i'm liking  the quality let's go for another bite on this really nice but hey if the main star of the show  for this review that cheesy chicken quesadilla is   not to your liking you've got three other options  you can go in on with these lunch boxes guys   including a chicken guacamole burrito baja shrimp  tacos which i actually reviewed not that long ago   you can take a look at that review popping up on  your screen here right now as well as an avocado   gordita which is kind of nice but again for me  it's got to be the quesadilla action i was very   looking forward to doing this actually for that  reason and i gotta say i'm very glad that i did   a lovely situation overall with this just to  give you another look here you gotta love all   the toasted goodness of this tortilla guys it is  just a lovely situation plenty of cheese and i'm   trying to keep that focus for you plenty of that  white meat on the inside or dark meat i should   say along with that shredded jack cheese is a  decent amount and again the quality of what you're   getting really feels a little bit more restaurant  style guys like i said pretty banging value for   $6.99 and an easy recommendation to give this a  shot if you've got el pollo loco in the area   get the lunch you really want with the loco  lunch box so with that said i'm going to have   to give this variation of the local lunch box  meals over here at el pollo loco featuring the   cheesy chicken quesadilla a rock solid 10 out  of 10 guys there's really nothing wrong with   this whatsoever and there's a lot of food  that you're going to get for $6.99 there and   like i said when considering the a la carte  price of the cheesy quesadilla on its own   how could you not get the meal right even without  the drink you're coming out with a lot of food   and i think it'll fill you up pretty nicely so i  love the touch of the chips naturally a little bit   of that pureed guac on the side but guys your  choice of the side two which is pretty amazing   and dessert with a full-sized churro just a banging combination an   easy recommendation like i said if you've got  el pollo loco in the area and since we happen   to be on that topic all of a sudden which we're  kind of going in that direction do you have an   el pollo loco in the area drop some comments down  below let me know if you've got one close to   you and even if you don't are you going to be  traveling just a little bit to give this a shot   i think it's kind of worth it if you ask me  drop those comments down below and definitely   let me know and with that this is Ian K closing  out another high quality foodie feature for you   here on peep this out reviews bringing you brand
