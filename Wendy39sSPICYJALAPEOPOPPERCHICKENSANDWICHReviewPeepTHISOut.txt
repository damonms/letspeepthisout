 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty hey everyone welcome to another high quality  foodie feature for you here on the channel where   this time i'm back on over at wendy's because it's  on and poppin with their all new limited time only   jalapeno popper menu so let's most definitely  get into it guys feast your eyes on the all-new   jalapeno popper chicken sandwich here at wendy's  and i am definitely digging the presentation of   this one crispy edges galore around that  chicken filet it's looking pretty dynamite   so starting off with the obvious we've got a very  soft brioche style bun and when we pop it you're   gonna notice there is a ton of jalapeno cream  cheese guys looking very very awesome i have to   admit there along with the sliced jalapenos a  lovely situation and that's in addition to the   shredded pepper jack cheese and the bacon because  why not right but guys of course the star of the   show aside from all the condiments is going to be  that crispy chicken patty 100% white meat fileted   and i got to say guys it looks pretty awesome nice  and crispy nice and golden nothing on the very   bottom of it because it's all front loaded on the  top and i'm perfectly okay with that guys so with   all that goodness on the top of this one i think  it would be an understatement to say that this is   a pretty tasty looking chicken sandwich because  honestly it really does look pretty fantastic   but i gotta be honest here cream cheese on  a chicken sandwich that's gotta be a first   i'm definitely excited to give this a go right  now so enough talking for the moment let's peep   this out guys it's the all-new jalapeno popper  chicken sandwich here at wendy's let's do it wow there is a decent amount of heat coming off  this one right now guys and did i mention it   actually has a cheese sauce on top of it so  that's mixing with the cream cheese and the   sliced jalapenos together and then the heat  coming off of everything together with that   with the nice juiciness of the chicken  fillet is pretty awesome guys let's go   for one more bite you're gonna want to see  the inside of this one it is pretty great well i was very curious about the jalapeno cream  cheese on this one combining with chicken but   honestly it's combining more with the outer  coating of the chicken and even as the heat   is beginning to build as i'm talking right now my  mouth is absolutely watering because this is super   delicious the smokiness of that bacon is coming  through but again that cream cheese is really   different and i have to say it goes amazing with  those jalapenos a lovely situation here already   you know i think most of you guys can pretty  much agree that wendy's is one of the kings   when it comes to chicken sandwiches they're  pretty much known for that on top of their   fresh never frozen beef but guys a lovely  situation with this and that combination of   a jalapeno cream cheese and that cheese sauce on  top of it with the sliced jalapenos and the bacon   it goes on and on and on a very nice combination  of goodness here let's go for another bite oh yeah that is such a vibrant rich tasting cream  cheese it's very very tangy and i really love the   fact that it combines with the heat beautifully  on top of the cheese sauce and of course the bacon   just a great amount of condiments on this and  guys it's really highlighting a lot of flavor   you know the only real complaint i have with this  one is the fact that it does seem a little on the   small side for the price point but then again it  is southern cali it's a little bit more expensive   over here but the quality of what i'm having right  now as in my mouth is beginning to water because   it's really picking up right now is really  really great the heat is really really solid   it's not crazy spicy but it's going to make your  mouth water and everything that this has to offer   is just layering that heat with some beautiful  flavor in general so let's go for another bite   we'll close this one out after the rating a lovely  situation to give this one a go and guys the   cheese sauce again with the sliced jalapenos and  that jalapeno cream cheese bangin' man that last   bite was the steamiest one yet but let's go 360  here while my mouth is watering big time guys a   lovely situation when it comes to the chicken over  here at wendy's and that crispy goodness is nice   and thick i'm loving the overall condiments they  chose for this one and honestly the bacon a nice   little accent on top of it the cheese combination  again is an amazing situation that philly cream   cheese style that i'm getting from this one the  jalapeno goodness mixes so nicely with the cheese   sauce this is a high recommendation so jumping  right to the rating i'm gonna have to give the   all-new jalapeno popper chicken sandwich here at  wendy's a rock solid 9 out of 10 my mouth is   still watering like crazy trying to finish this  review right now guys but i'm loving every minute   of it because everything this one has to offer is  lighting my taste buds up big time in addition to   that heat but the jalapenos are a nice addition to  that on top of the bacon as they usually are but   the combination of that philly style cream cheese  and the cheese sauce a lovely situation guys   just a beautiful sandwich to give a go and you're  gonna give it a go right i have a feeling you are   so do me a solid and drop some comments down below  satisfy my curiosity to let me know that you're   gonna be giving this one a shot and if you do  give it a go are you going to be changing anything   on it are you going to be customizing in any  particular way drop those comments down below and
