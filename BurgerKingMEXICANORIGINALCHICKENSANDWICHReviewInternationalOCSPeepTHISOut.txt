 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K  stay frosty what's going on everyone and welcome   to the channel where today I'm back on over a good  old BK to check out another variation of their   all-new International original chicken sandwiches  and this one looks to be bringing a little bit of   heat that's right and as you obviously know by  the title to this one get ready for it because   it's the Mexican Original Chicken Sandwich over  here at BK and already we've got a nice little   crispy situation of jalapeno goodness to go in on  with this one it's looking pretty decent so far   let's break it on down for you real fast you know  you got to love that long specialty Bun over here   at BK when it comes to these chicken sandwiches  it's iconic for a reason guys looking pretty   decent let's pop in take a look underneath on this  one and as you're gonna see no shortage of spicy   queso and crispy jalapenos this is looking pretty  nice guys I'm sure this is going to have a decent   amount of crunch very cool in that department  as we pan on down of course the major star of   the show with this one aside from the Toppings is  the original chicken sandwich Patty itself that formed   chicken nugget the elongated chicken nugget over  here at BK it's iconic it definitely looks pretty   decent it's breaded up beautifully and fried  to a crispy golden brown underneath it it looks   like we've got more of that spicy queso goodness  and I'm down with that because I love cheese so   that's obviously pretty awesome there but guys  a very simple build on this one but with the   spicy queso and the crispy jalapenos I'm thinking  we're in for a little bit of a heated situation   so let's not waste any more time on  this one let's see if that's actually   true this is the all-new Mexican Original  Chicken Sandwich part of the international   original chicken sandwiches here  at BK let's peep out this flavor   so it looks like the original chicken sandwich  over here at BK is getting a nice little heated   upgrade with two of the ingredients that were  actually on the ghost pepper Whopper from this   past Halloween which I checked out take a look at  that review jumping up on your screen here right   now this is pretty much a carryover from that on  top of the original chicken sandwich over here so   I'm down with that and again with the spicy queso  and those crispy jalapenos a very lovely situation   so let's see if this one's gonna deliver this one  is dubbed the Mexican Original Chicken Sandwich   part of the international original chicken  sandwiches here at BK let's peep this out mmm cheesy I like that stuff that's good   and like the ghost pepper Whopper it's  got that Sizzle so hang on one second here very nice it's taking me back to Halloween time  with the exception of this being chicken and not   beef but guys I am totally digging those crispy  jalapenos a very nice amount of Sizzle overall   with that spicy queso think of it as kind  of like a spicy nacho cheese sauce that's   pretty much what it is when you add that to  the saltiness of the chicken the crispiness   of the chicken and a decent amount of white  meat on the inside it's not bad with this   particular one kind of a fun little pseudo heated  upgrade to an original classic introduced back in   1979 man I'm feeling old just saying that out  loud let's go for a few more bites on this one mmm you know I gotta keep showing it to you this  one is pretty vibrant in that cheesy flavor along   with the crispy jalapenos guys and the saltiness  is definitely up there and I'm digging that   because the combination goes extremely well it's  nice and soft on the specialty bun the iconic   Original Chicken Sandwich specialty bun nice  combination overall the flavors with this one and   overall just a very tasty version of The Original  Chicken Sandwich pretty nice on this variant   you know I gotta say the real standout with this  one for me in particular the fact that I love   cheese of course is the spicy queso because  it's very different over here at BK and I'm   glad they're using it on a second sandwich now  hopefully we'll see more down the line but guys   the fact that I have it on the top and the bottom  is a lovely situation you're guaranteed to get a   nice little cheesy blast with every bite and the  fact that you're getting the crunchy goodness and   of course gotta keep showing it to you the crispy  jalapenos are really doing a number right now to   add even additional crunch to what's already a  pretty tasty and crunchy chicken patty on this   guys so pretty tasty so let's go for another  couple of bites on this one guys because I'm   totally down with the cheesy aspect of this one  especially with that heated action which its got   as well which I'm actually getting a little bit  more used to as I go let's go for another couple all right that last bite had a little bit  of extra spice for me hang on one second wow I really like this one it is pretty  tasty so not too much else to say about   this one guys it's what you'd expect it to  be from the original chicken sandwich that   flavor is the same but with that spicy queso  the nacho cheese action that I'm getting with   this one along with the crispy jalapenos  a very nice situation dubbed the Mexican   variant because of the heat I get it with  the jalapenos it's cool but a pretty nice   variation of the international original  chicken sandwiches here at BK let's go   for one more bite we'll wrap the review with  the rating coming up next hang on one second well if you haven't gotten the point by now let me  just drive it home for you this is a very cheesy   variant of the original chicken sandwich over  here at BK the crispy goodness of that chicken   is definitely pretty decent of course that formed  chicken nugget Patty adding in a double dose of   cheese on the top and the bottom the spicy  action with the crispy jalapenos you've got   a lot to look forward to with this one I would  highly recommend giving this one a shot but   do have a little drink on the side because it does  have a little bit of a Sizzle not bad on this one   so with that said I'm gonna have to give the  Mexican Original Chicken Sandwich part of the   international Original Chicken Sandwich Trio  here at BK an awesome   8.5 out of 10 guys cheese Galore on this particular one top  and bottom you can really taste that nacho cheese   goodness of course the spiciness is really  handled pretty nicely the crispy jalapenos   the crispiness of the chicken itself this is  really the top tier version I think out of   these three so far and I may be just a little  biased because I do love cheese but the fact   that I'm getting it on the top and the bottom  and it's very tasty like that guys I'm down for   it I'm here for it obviously very tasty and I  would definitely recommend giving this one a go   all right so now the obvious question are
