the lemon coming up right after it Wow creaminess of that cream cheese goodness in there as well I'm saying goodness because I don't mind the flavor on this one it is really overpowered by the blueberry and the lemon and that fried crispy outer coating right there guys look at that that is a lovely situation let's go for another bite mmm Oh man that is bangin that is really banging mmm I love the fried outer coating on this and makes such a huge difference to the overall flavor naturally because guys really anything fried is gonna be pretty amazing but when you pair that up with the preserves that this one it's got here really really strong blueberry as well as the lemon that is just an awesome situation so totally totally bangin and I gotta say shout outs to Chew boom right now

half and then we'll wrap this one up after the rating but guys this is really delicious it really is mmm so yeah deliciously wonderfully fried situation over here guys I am really digging the casing this one comes in here that crust really sets this one off all around it's a very decent amount of filling all throughout they did a really really great job with this and as you can see the flavors really really stand out with all that filling on the inside you're getting a nice mix of that blueberry and that lemon and the cream cheese is really just the creaminess that it's adding to everything but it is just really really delicious and like I said I'd highly recommend this to you it's totally worth the buck twenty nine so I'm not even gonna waste any time with this one guys that was straight fire right now truly truly a delicious snack and with that said obviously I think you know what's coming I'm gonna have to give the blueberry lemon cream cheese pie here at Popeyes a rock-solid 10 out of 10 totally delivered on flavor totally delivered on texture and the quality of what's on the inside of that really speaks to what you're getting with it guys lots of great flavor
