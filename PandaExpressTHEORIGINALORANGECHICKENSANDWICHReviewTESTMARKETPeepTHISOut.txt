 hey everyone welcome back to another high quality  foodie feature for you here on the channel   where this time i'm over at the panda express  innovation kitchen in pasadena california to go   in on if you can believe it their entry into the  never-ending chicken sandwich wars that's right   they're testing the original orange chicken  sandwich so stay tuned because it's up next   welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty so here it is the original orange chicken  sandwich currently in test here at the panda   express innovation kitchen and already guys i have  to say the appearance of this one looks pretty   inviting that king's hawaiian bun looks really  soft on top and it looks like there's a lot of   tasty crispy goodness right there in the middle so  let's pop the top and take a look underneath and   it looks like we've got plenty of their famous  orange chicken sauce that is drenching the very   top of the bun here guys and as you can see the  chicken breast itself that crispy white meat is   looking pretty nice as well it's not overly large  a little on the thin side but it's got more of a   flash fry / tempura style type of coating to  it and i'm really digging the overall appearance   it's absolutely filling out this bun underneath  it it looks like we have a nice bed of shredded   cabbage along with some crinkle cut pickles that  are peeking out there along with some spicy aioli   sauce for some added kick but as we pan back  up to the chicken breast itself you're going   to notice that there is no orange chicken sauce  to speak of on the very bottom so you can really   see how this one is formed i kind of wish there  was more of that sauce there to coat this one   just a little bit more but regardless the orange  chicken sauce that is present is very aromatic   right now and i gotta say guys the presentation on  the very top of the chicken does look pretty solid   so let's not waste any more time on this one this  is the original orange chicken sandwich currently   in test at the panda express innovation kitchen  in pasadena california let's peep out this flavor   well i gotta say i'm very thankful for the  chicken sandwich diaper with this one guys   because considering the amount of the orange  chicken sauce on the very top of the chicken   and the spicy aioli goodness on the very bottom  there is a lot that is kind of leaking out the   back and it's very sticky as you can see this  one definitely presents well and it's got a lot   of moisture for sure definitely digging the  presentation and i got to say guys a chicken   sandwich coming from panda express who would  have thought right and honestly since we're   on the topic of that real quick i guess it's  not too much of a stretch considering they do   have an orange chicken burrito at the innovation  kitchen which is actually a pretty tasty thing   i actually reviewed that a while back and you're  probably noticing that right now as it's popping   up here on your screen but i gotta say guys with  the addition of a pancake scallion to kind of sub   in for tortilla that was actually a pretty  interesting experience but with this one guys   a chicken sandwich from panda express of course  it's got the pickles in there you'd expect that   to be there but with all the other asian flair  this one has i'm definitely digging that with   the exception of the king's hawaiian bread we're  going to get into that in just a second so without   further ado here we go it's the original orange  chicken sandwich here at panda express let's do it wow that is pretty dynamic in flavor guys  scratch what i said earlier about wanting   more of the orange chicken sauce on the very  bottom of this one there is plenty of it on the   top that is combining beautifully with the actual  sauce on the very bottom and spicy aioli is adding   just a little bit more creaminess but guys the  quality of the chicken is not bad as i'm going   into that it's got a light coating here so there's  a lot more white meat which i'm already digging   and when you add in the snap crunch and  the acidity of the pickles that is such   an interesting flavor mixing with the orange  chicken sauce the pickles are a nice add-on   with this but guys super delicious so  far pretty impressed let's keep going in and again i'm so thankful for the chicken sandwich  diaper on this one because like i said it is very   sticky so absolutely it is needed with this  there is plenty of sauce in the very bottom   and that's the compensation i think for no orange  chicken sauce on the very bottom of the chicken   patty itself it really is a nice combination with  the added crunch of those pickles and the cabbage   just a nice combination the king's hawaiian bread  adds a little bit of sweetness to it as you'd   expect and the overall feeling is very nice and  guys speaking on the king's hawaiian bread real   quick it's a very interesting choice in my opinion  to actually choose that type of bread to test this   type of chicken sandwich here at panda because  when i think of panda express i don't think of   kings hawaiian i'm thinking more of like steam bao  buns or something along those lines and actually   guys i think that would have been a little bit  of a better choice with this because it's more   synonymous i think with the brand as well as what  you'd kind of expect from them and while i dig the   quality of the king's hawaiian bread don't get me  wrong it's definitely pretty tasty it's got the   sweetness factor bao buns in general for those of  you guys who don't know is a sweet type of white   dough which is kind of like what you'd expect  to find like i said here at panda and they've   actually done something like that in the past not  too long ago over here you're probably noticing   one of my other test marker reviews that i did  back in the day specifically on their pastrami   pork belly bao which was a pretty tasty situation  guys and honestly it was that type of bread that   they were using with the filling it was a pastrami  pork belly on the inside of bao buns and i guess   in a way it kind of simulates that with this but  being king's hawaiian naturally the consistency   and the density of the actual bread itself is  a little similar because it really does kind of   soak things up it's a little sweeter it's got some  puffiness to it even though it's getting a little   small as i'm pressing down but still i do think  that would have been a better choice just visually   because i think it would have been very very  different on top of what you'd kind of expect so   this is kind of similar to what you would kind of  see at other fast food places i mean arby's has done   kings hawaiian and there's been a lot of particular  kings hawaiian sandwiches out there from other   places but even still coming out from panda it's  different but like i said guys this already has   pickles on it you never see that on anything over  at panda so this is actually very very interesting   let's go for another couple more bites guys  pretty good on this though flavor is really good you know i think the back up flavor that i'm  getting from the pickles and that spicy aioli   along with the crunch of the pickles in general  and the cabbage is really kind of what's doing   it for me right now on top of the upfront flavor  of the orange chicken sauce itself but guys again   i gotta say it's very dynamic in flavor  i mean that's really the only word that   really jumps out at me because there's so much  going on as you bite into it i mean my taste   buds are lit up which is a beautiful thing  but like i said the sweetness of that king's   hawaiian bread i wish was looking a little  bit different like a white bao bun situation   housing all that good stuff on the inside  i think they should really consider that   if they decide to go national with this because i  think visually it would just look pretty amazing   but hey i guess that's the whole point of these  test market items right i mean to get the feedback   from the public to see what works so really i  would love to see this go national because the   quality of everything all the flavors are really  amazing with it the addition of the pickles   along with orange chicken sauce who wouldn't  thought that's actually a very nice combo   on top of the spicy aioli very very tasty stuff  all right so let's go for one more bite before   we close this one out after the rating coming  up next but guys a very cool test market item   and something completely out of the blue for the  ongoing chicken sandwich wars from panda express   very very slick let's go in one more time well i  gotta say the combination of all those very tasty   flavors goes amazingly well with the overall  juiciness of this white meat chicken breast   guys it really is done very nicely and with the  tempura-like flash fry that it's got here it's   not overly coated but it's a nice combination a  nice ratio of goodness to give you the feeling   that you're having orange chicken but naturally  in a very portable form the king's hawaiian   bread definitely does the job as you can see it's  getting just a little bit flatter as i'm biting   into it here but even still the added sweetness  that it's got as well just a very nice combination   and a very tasty chicken sandwich entry from panda  express i never thought i'd hear myself say that   you know i gotta say considering how warm and  soft this chicken sandwich was when i pulled it   out of the foil baggie that you'd expect most of  these chicken sandwiches if not all of them to be   in these days i have to say guys the feeling of  the sandwich in my hands itself was pretty much   kind of like a bao bun situation that's what i  was kind of thinking right away because all the   moisture soaks in and it feels very soft so like  i said while i wish this was actually a bao bun   situation because i think that would really work  well and i know i'm beating this one to death it's   only because i'd kind of expect something like  this from panda and while king's hawaiian bread   is decent like i said i'd much rather have the  other one just to try it at least but as it stands   what we've got here is a very delicious chicken  sandwich with a little bit of asian flair mixed   into it guys and i have to admit the combination  of that orange chicken sauce and those pickles   that's a new favorite right there on top of the  spicy aioli it's a very nice combination and i   gotta say again don't worry about the fact that  there's not too much orange chicken sauce on the   bottom of the chicken itself there's plenty of all  the other stuff there and it's drenched on top so   overall just a lovely situation for that alone so  with everything you've seen and heard of my review   up to this point along with those awesome flavors  that i've experienced personally with you right   now on camera for the very first time i'm gonna  have to give the original orange chicken sandwich   currently in test here at the panda express  innovation kitchen in pasadena california a   pretty awesome 8.5 out of 10 guys on  its own it's a very interesting chicken sandwich   with some amazing dynamic flavors like i said  everything is so upfront when you bite into it and   it's super flavorful i love the flash fry coating  of the chicken itself and it's just juicy enough   and just thick enough to really give you that  extra denseness but overall it's the combination   of the flavors of the sauces along with believe it  or not just the overall softness of the bun itself   i'm not going to tell you again what i prefer  it was on but even still what is there is pretty   awesome the king's hawaiian is pretty tasty all  right so i've got a couple of questions for you   because i'd venture to guess if you've made it  this far into the review you're pretty interested   in this particular chicken sandwich so do me a  quick favor drop some comments down below let me   know if you think you'd like to see this one go  national and if you do would you like to try it   on the king's hawaiian bread that it's currently  testing on right now or would you like to try it   on maybe say a bao bun do me a favor drop those  comments down below and definitely let me know   and with that this is Ian K closing out another  high quality foodie feature for you here on peep   this out reviews bringing you brand new content  every single week here on my channel so while you stay   tuned for that next review coming real soon in the  meantime stay frosty pretty good stuff with this   one panda pretty good stuff but if you do bring  this one out nationally you can actually leave   off the spicy aioli and technically have a classic  variant so if people want the spicy one they can   just get it with the spicy sauce two different  options still in king's hawaiian bread or a   bao bun preferably that would be pretty good  alright guys until next time i'll talk to you soon   hey thanks for checking out another one  of my reviews but just in case you didn't   see the one before this one you can find  it right up over here along what i think   youtube's gonna recommend for you to check  out as well as always i think you'll find   something to like in both of them and i'll  definitely catch you in the next one see ya
