 [Music] welcome to peep this out reviews with  Ian k stay frosty what's going on everyone   and welcome to the channel where today I'm over at  good old BK to check out an ultra rare quad Burger   sighting that just happens to be part of their  latest returning promo that's right everyone   it's not every day that you see a quad Burger over  here at BK as part of their regular menu offerings   and for this latest promo it's definitely  on showcase and I'm going to Showcase it for   you right now Feast your eyes on what I've got  here it's the quad BK Stacker a very cheesy very   meaty situation here and I gotta say this looks  absolutely gorgeous let me break this one on down   for you real fast yes sir lots of flame grilled  beefy goodness to go with all the ooey gooey   cheesy goodness that is definitely the way Ian k  likes to get down with it over here at BK this is   looking pretty awesome so let's pop the sesame  seed bun and take a look underneath and right   away tons of stacker sauce on the very top of  this one guys it is all over the place as we pan   on down it is definitely a gluttonous situation  for sure we've got plenty of their crispy bacon   and that's all on top of four flame grilled beef  patties guys it's actually a half pound of beef   before cooking so this is definitely stacked for  sure a little on the small side for the patties   but guys the thickness is definitely there and  then naturally separating each of those patties   if you can even see the separation four slices  of American cheese this thing is all congealed   together and I gotta say the aroma is definitely  kicking in the car here right now this looks super   satisfying and truth be told I don't even have  to split these Burgers individually because I can   see they're stacked pretty high this is looking  pretty great guys let's not waste any more time   on this let's get into it it's the all-new quad  BK Stacker here at BK let's peep out this flavor   so yeah man four little patties over here for  this little stacker and it almost feels like   a snack sized Burger but naturally when it's  stacked up with all this goodness and trust me   you're gonna see a lot of footage like this all  throughout the review this is definitely a very   rare sighting over here at BK because they don't  normally do quad Burgers I mean here on the West   Coast we've got Jack in the Box which loves to do  the quad Burger situation for the beef as well as   the chicken I think over at Wendy's pretty much  a triple is the highest that you can go so even   still these are smaller patties but at the same  time very satisfying with the cheesy action and   the bacon and the stacker sauce let's not waste  any more time because I'm doing that right now   I want to get into this this is the all-new  quad BK Stacker here at BK let's peep this out oh beefy wow but right off the break don't let  the size fool you guys because even though   this really feels like more of the value bun  situation the meat is absolutely stacked high   and as you can see I've got a lot of Flame  Grilled goodness to go in on with this guys   this is a really beautiful situation it's  classic BK flavor you can definitely know   it when you taste it plenty of cheese the light  zip and Tang that I'm getting from that stacker   sauce the bacon itself is pretty banging as  well let's keep going in guys this is crazy   delicious crazy gluttonous I'm so glad I'm  doing a quad right now let's keep going in mmm man this is a lot of beef well if you're watching this review  after hours please accept my humble apologies   because first thing in the morning you need to  get yourself over to BK and pick up one of these   quad BK stackers these are very satisfying  I would rock this for breakfast easily as   you can see plenty of the beefy goodness  this really does feel like a half pound of   beef for sure guys because like I said even  though it's stacked high and it's a smaller   Burger the fact that it is stacked high is very  gluttonous when you bite into it very awesome   and just like I mentioned earlier this is pretty  much classic BK flavor guys and again I got to   keep showing it to you just like I remember as  a kid definitely the flame grilled goodness very   familiar with that stacker sauce adding just a  little bit of zip a little bit of Tang it's not   quite thousand island but it's definitely unique  and then naturally the smokiness of that bacon   on top of it guys very tasty and again with  a half pound of beef before cooking it feels   like it so it's very dense very thick small in  the palm of your hand but very satisfying so   let's go for another couple on this one guys  super delicious you know that by now right mmm man you know it's funny I was going over my BK  playlist here on the channel and I noticed that   I've never had a quad variation of any of the  burgers over here at BK I've done all the King   burgers throughout the years so this essentially  is pretty much like a king Burger because it's   a half pound of beef two of the whopper-sized  patties but it's split down into four so it sounds   like a lot and it is because it's very dense  but it's small enough to really feel like you're   getting a lot of beef for the money with this one  guys considering the price point here in Southern   Cali about $6.69 a little bit more of a premium  but the flavor is banging on it and that's really   where it counts all right so let's go for one more  bite before we wrap the review with the rating   coming up next but guys again a very gluttonous  situation and again I got to keep showing it to   you because these patties are beautiful they are  just stacked pretty beautifully there's plenty   of cheese lots to go in on with this one and  again with more of a premium this really feels   like it's worth it because of the size it's pretty  thick one more bite and we'll wrap this one up hang on well this little mini me over here at BK really  packs a punch guys I am totally digging the amount   of beef on this and as we go around the world  with this one lots of cheesy goodness a very   basic build with the meat the cheese the bacon  and the sauce but I gotta say I am loving the   combination and like I said even though the  premium is up there in terms of price point   this is very satisfying very hearty to bite into  an easy recommendation to give this version a   shot it's pretty nice yes sir definitely a lot  of fun checking this one out today and I'm so   glad to have done it too because now I can pair  this review up with the previous one that I did   way back in the day which I believe was the double  BK Stacker and that was a lovely situation even   then but naturally with two more patties added  to this one of course guys you do have choices   should you want to do a little bit less than that  naturally as you're seeing here up on the screen   some different options are available but I gotta  say and I think most of you guys know me by now   if there's a quad option of something on the menu  that I'm reviewing I most definitely want to give   that a go because naturally I'm a fan of meat  and cheese and this one is definitely geared   towards my type of people so I am definitely down  with that and hey if you've made it this far into   the review you're most likely a meat and cheese  type of Peep just like myself so I think I'm in   good company right now and I think you are as  well all right guys so overall for the rating   I'm gonna have to give the quad BK Stacker  here at BK a rock solid 8.8 out of 10 very   solid definitely meaty definitely cheesy very  satisfying and price point notwithstanding naturally its  just a little bit more elevated you're getting  a very girthy type of burger to bite into it's   gluttonous it's definitely got all the goodies in  there plenty of meat plenty of cheese the stacker   sauce the bacon and of course that sesame seed bun  classic goodness very basic but super delicious   all right so now outside of confirming if you're  a meat and cheese type of Peep drop those comments   down below let me know what you thought of this  particular one I mean did this actually look like   it was worth the $6.69 for you here on the West  Coast does it look like more bang for the buck   for you considering the size of the meat it may  be small but it's thick but what did you guys   personally think drop those comments down below  and definitely let me know and with that this is   Ian K closing out another high quality foodie  feature for you here on peep this out reviews   bringing you brand new content every single week  here on my channel so while you stay tuned for that next   review coming real soon in the meantime
