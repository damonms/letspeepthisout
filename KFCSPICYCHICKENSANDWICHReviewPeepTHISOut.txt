 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty what's going on everyone welcome back to  another high quality foodie feature for you   here on the channel where i'm back on over at  kfc for another look at their all-new chicken   sandwich and this time we're going in on the  spicy variant and spicy it most definitely   looks guys feast your eyes on the spicy chicken  sandwich here at kfc and again a very lovely   situation in the size of the chicken patty  on this this is just looking flat out amazing   starting off just like the last time we've got  that classic brioche style bun lightly buttered   and underneath it we've got a huge chicken breast  here guys marinated in all the kfc goodness that   you know and love hand breaded in store 20% larger  and double breaded on top of it and i gotta say   it looks pretty fantastic underneath we've got  the usual pickle action and in this case instead   of mayo we have spicy zinger sauce so that's  definitely looking to deliver some extra heat to   this one and i gotta say the fried goodness that  i'm smelling in my car right now is so apparent   because this is made ultra fresh hand breaded  in store says a lot about the quality already   and again guys the lovely situation of the size of  the chicken patty is amazing on this so let's not   waste any more time it's the all-new spicy variant  of kfc's all-new chicken sandwich let's do it love that crunch that is crazy good oh  little bit of heat actually a lot of heat   that's actually really good i got a nice end  piece of the chicken patty along with that   zinger sauce and again with a little light  softness of the brioche style bun no pickles   in that first bite but man pretty amazing  let's go for another bite we'll give you a   close-up on this one but guys another beautiful  situation this is really a banging sandwich you know just like the last time around with  the classic chicken sandwich here at kfc that   i reviewed take a look at that review popping up  on your screen right now if you haven't seen that   one just yet the pickles go amazing with this in  general but when you pair that up with that spicy   zinger sauce a lovely situation and as you can  see those lovely situations just continue across   the board with this one guys because the flavor  of the chicken patty is really selling this one   on top of the crunchiness of those pickles a very  very great combination together and even though   this one doesn't have the creaminess of that  mayo which ultimately is not really my favorite   all the other flavors on this are  really singing very very nicely   the flavor of that zinger sauce i got to admit  is really nice in terms of the spice department   it's got a creaminess to it a little bit  of heat but really the star of the show   is going to be that chicken patty and  man is it the star it is really amazing   and the fact that it's double breaded and  20% larger overall you can really feel the   difference when you bite into this and again  the same $3.99 price point as you'd expect   from the industry right now considering that's  really the going rate for a chicken sandwich   that's what it should be at a bare maximum to  be honest considering the bars set by the other   guys you all know who they are right but guys a  very lovely situation again let's keep going in man that is so worth the wait so worth the wait  i like the combination of that spicy zinger sauce   with the pickles it's got just the right amount of  zip the creaminess is there and the heat is there   but none of that overpowers the flavors of the  chicken which is a beautiful situation you really   get the classic kfc goodness with this one and  the fact again that it's double breaded plus 20%   bigger guys it's just great across the board  and again $3.99 i keep coming back to it you   can't hate on it for that price point it is really  really awesome okay so let me go for one more bite   of this one we'll wrap it up after the rating  but this is another winner when it comes to the   chicken sandwich wars right now and especially  from one of the kings of the chicken game   this is absolutely a banging variant of their  all-new chicken sandwich pretty awesome let's go   well i was biting into this one pretty  heavy guys we're a little bit past the   halfway point of the sandwich but let's just go  around here and give you a look at everything   nice and crispy nice and crunchy again all  the classic kfc flavor that you know and love   just on steroids and overload with the flavor  of that zinger sauce i think this is gonna be   my favorite version of the two and i gotta admit  i am absolutely loving it again the pickles are a   showpiece along with that chicken lovely situation  so just like the first kfc chicken sandwich that i   just put out recently this is going to be very  easy to score with everything you've seen and   heard me talk about in this review i'm going  to have to give the spicy variant of their   chicken sandwich here at kfc a well deserved  10 out of 10 guys it's another perfect score   it's the same sandwich as the last time out with  a beautiful amount of heat to go with and i gotta   admit again those pickles are amazing with this  you really want to ask for a few extra on the side   the quality definitely stands out i think kfc  knows what they're doing in that department   because they're noticeably different from the  other guys again the 20% larger chicken patty on   that is amazing the fact that it's double  breaded you have a lot to look forward to   trust me okay so i've got one simple question for  you when it comes to all these fast food chicken   sandwiches out there right now do you prefer  the classic variant or the spicy variant what's   your go to drop some comments down below and  definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K   closing out another high quality foodie feature  for you here on peep
