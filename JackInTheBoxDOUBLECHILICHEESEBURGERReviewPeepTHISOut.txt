off with a quick shot  of the combo itself featuring curly fries in   this case and a small drink but we're going  to be focusing on the main star of the show   feast your eyes on that double chili cheeseburger  looking pretty nice guys with a decent amount of   goodness right there in the middle of those buns  and that bun sure is pretty soft let's pop and   take a look underneath it and it looks like there  is no shortage of chopped onions along with that   chili guys there's a lot of it on the top of  this bun here right now and that's all sitting   on top of two beef patties as you can see along  with melted american cheese let me see if i can   split that meat for you and see if we can get a  little bit of cheese pull action looks like just   a little bit not too bad but they are value-sized  patties let's take a look underneath that looks   like nothing on the bottom but as you can see a  very healthy amount of the good stuff here guys   chili cheese onions and beef together inside of a  bun let's see if the flavor is going to deliver on   this one it's the double chili cheeseburger here  at jack in the box let's peep out this flavor all   right so it looks like i didn't really think  this one out too well because i'm about to go   into a double chili cheeseburger wearing white  so i'm going to have to be very careful with   this one but let me just say a huge shout out  to jack right now for the burger diaper this   one absolutely needs it and considering what i've  got here right now it is absolutely welcome guys   there is no shortage of chili and chopped onions  on this along with the cheesy goodness right there   this should be pretty awesome i'm thinking all  right so before i hopefully confirm that goodness   for you and like always if you

content drops every  week guys here we go the double chili cheeseburger   my first time having a chili cheeseburger over  here at jack in the box let's give it a shot that is a lot of chili there is some very rich  tex-mex spicing going on with this chili right now   guys i can't tell if there's really beans in this  or not because i'm really getting the vibe that   there is but it's very meaty on top of the beef  itself and of course the crunchiness of the onions   it's very very hearty and guys with the  value patties being the size that they are   i'd recommend doing the double and as you  guys can see real quick here it makes a   difference because these thin patties would  be just that very thin but naturally the   double really is the ideal amount with this  let's go for another bite not bad so far   yeah that's a hearty beefy chili flavor with this  one and it stands out well above the beef patties   themselves which are not too bad in the flavor  department guys a little on the drier side but   the moisture from the chili is making up for it  along with the melted cheese but obviously with   the onions in there for added crunch and actually  added moisture it's a very nice combination   and again this double really is the way to go  considering the size of the beef patty so far here   very very tasty well i guess it wasn't really too  surprised going through the drive-thru seeing that   they have their loaded and sauced fries back  again with chili fries being one of the options   which i actually had a lot of fun checking out  and again take a look at the playlist in the   upper right hand corner of your display for proof  of that it's a good time for sure but naturally   having a burger promo that has that chili now  it's a beautiful situation and again i'm very   glad for this burger diaper on the very back here  guys let's go for another bite and keep going in man that is beefy yeah i'm definitely a diced  onion type of guy and there sure is a lot of   them on this one here guys i only wish there  was a little bit more throughout maybe having   a little bit of the chili on the bottom but  again i think that would have been more of a   slip slide situation there but considering  how many onions are on this right now   and they're not the slivered onions these are  like chopped pieces of onions guys pretty nice   let me see if i can actually pull  this back for you give you an idea   of what i am looking at look at that on the inside  very hearty very messy but i gotta say the flavor   is off the chart in terms of the flavor of the  onions on top of the chili you got to have a   little diced onion with the chili for that crunch  and just the overall flavor that it adds but guys   beautiful situation on this all right so let me go  for one more quick bite of this one and then we'll   finish this one out after the rating but guys a  very lovely situation with the chili over here   jack-in-the-box and i'm so glad to finally have  this in the portfolio of content that i have   from them because guys it's just delicious chili  and i have to admit the fact that those tex-mex   spices are really standing out the onions are a  beautiful touch i'm glad they're not very tiny   minced pieces of onion they're actually large  nice pieces i'm really digging that guys and   the quality again of the beef even though it's  little on the drier side is actually helped   along because of the chili and i think i see why  they do that but along with everything else here   not bad for what you're getting the curly fries  the drink the value of what you're getting for   $6.99 here on the west coast not bad one more bite we'll close this one out all right so let me try   and do this carefully 360 without the burger  diaper and as you can see no shortage of those   onions guys i am really loving that and again the  size of the beef patties being what they are more   value sized you want to do the double it's going  to give you more of that denseness that you're   looking for obviously more onions out the back  the cheese is decent it's a little lost in the   mix with the cheese but the overall flavor of the  chili is the main star of the show with this one   but guys a lovely situation and again if you  love onions like i do you're gonna dig this   this is pretty nice order on ubereats postmates  and grubhub so with that said i'm gonna have to   give the all-new double chili cheeseburger here at  jack-in-the-box a pretty rock solid  9 out of 10 now the only way that i can really see to improve upon this one and as always is the case with most   of these promo burgers is maybe making the cheese  just a little bit more pronounced because as it   stands that is a total chili showcase guys as  it should be the quality of the chili is amazing   i just wish the cheese itself stood out just a  little bit more but guys the onions coming up   on the back end more than makes up for that extra  flavor and the overall togetherness of everything   in that burger and like i said throughout this  review you gotta do the double because a single   patty is just not gonna do it for you and you can  tell that by the size of the value patties on this   very very solid and an easy recommendation  especially if you like chili burgers okay so now   the obvious couple of questions first off do you  love chili burgers i have a feeling if you've made   it this far into the review you probably do and if  that is the case are you going to be giving this   one a shot drop some comments down below if you've  got jack in the box in the area how excited are   you to give this chili cheeseburger a shot over  here and are you going to do the double drop those   comments down below and definitely let me know  and with that this is Ian K closing out another   high quality foodie feature for you here on peep  this out reviews bringing you brand new content   every single week here on my channel so while you  stay tuned for that next review coming real soon   in the meantime stay frosty nice one on this one  jack but i'm kind of surprised you don't have a   triple variant available officially on your menu
