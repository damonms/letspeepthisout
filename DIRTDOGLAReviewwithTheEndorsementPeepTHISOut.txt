 hey everyone I'm back at it this time in Old Town Pasadena with a wingman you got that right guys the endorsement is in the house right now a little peep told me he was swinging into town and I said to myself if he's planning on staying frosty on the west coast how can we not link up and make something happen here right now you guys ready to do some damage together with the endorsement are you ready to do it I'm ready let's go welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty all right so the endorsement yes when you hear the word dirt dog or words I should say what's the person that comes to mind honestly motorcycle gang I'm talking Harley's custom jackets everything in the bag you got the patch everything leather definitely some leather a wiener dog in the back there maybe on a motorcycle let's have a thing what do you think now about that but I think you're leading me to a certain answer so well you would be correct because not only is this the first time that the endorsement is here in the Southland right now it's actually the first time we're checking out someplace locally that I've never been personally and that is dirt dog supposedly a lot of la flair with some really awesome hot dogs and I figure if we're gonna experience something brand new it's our very first time doing an in-person collab why don't we do it here right I think you should be a lot of fun what do you think I think it'll be a blast all right yeah let's go let's go in dirt dog all right endorsement I don't know about you but we have serious bacon wrapped goodness in front of us here right now look at the selection what is jumping out of you right away I love the names dirty corn yeah something I wanna me that is very cool getting straight-up dirty up in this piece right now look at the flaming dog right above that pastrami elote look at that dirty chili dog with the house dog oh man we have a lot to choose from here it's gonna be tough but we got to pick a couple so we're gonna find out here in just a sec okay all right we are totally gonna have fun with this right now the endorsement are you ready for this I'm ready what you are about to see I think what you saw up in the menu board look pretty epic look pretty monumental I thought yes really high-end the atmosphere really really cool on the inside there but guys I don't know about you take a look at what we've got here this is pretty crazy right now the Patty melt dog is what I'm rockin with here and this is pretty insane look how high this is first off you get your choice of rolls which is kind of cool it's like a basic roll and a lobster roll I think they said $0.50 up charge for the lobster roll yes and I think it's worth it considering how the toastiness and everything on the outside of this is gonna be looking here so we opted to get both naturally yes a new experience for both of us right now this is gonna be fun to experience with you guys but the patty melt dog a bacon-wrapped dog initially that's the base and then you have basically topped off with french fries you have a cheddar cheese sauce you've got chipotle aioli bacon bits peppers it is just a monumental glorified mess of goodness and I might say looking very dirty I gotta admit I'm thinking pretty dirty thoughts with this right now this is pretty pretty nice don't get it twisted but really really beautiful can't wait to get into this the endorsement however I took a step back went a little relaxed version if you can call any of these relaxed no I went with house dog check out that bad boy right there so what we're looking at here what is it I think they said on every dog it comes with red and green bell peppers onions bacon bits bacon bits standard and standard right I went with a lobster roll as well and I'm guessing lobster roll very reminiscent of a New England lobster roll right there I toasted and the bacon wraps goodness as always oh yeah and the bacon wrapped dog but yeah so no oh one other mention there's ketchup on this bad boy and mayonnaise right and the description didn't mention out the girl inside which by the way we glossed over that right phenomenal customer service over here beautiful beautiful definitely that's like oh I got to say guys I am very excited only because not only is does that look amazing and of course it's definitely an awesome looking dog but first of all if you're thinking about how am I gonna wrap my mouth around this particular dog right now that's a question I'm trying to answer myself as we're filming this right now here in Old Town Pasadena really really insane I don't really know a really nice way to do this we're just gonna pick these up for both gonna take a bite we're gonna see how this goes but it's great to have the endorsement in town from the East Coast and naturally I think I know a thing or two about hot dogs about pizza and all that good stuff over there so this is really gonna be the test to see if this is gonna stand the test of what you're used to yeah I'm excited presentation is already incredible yeah so uh one thing I always you know got to get it right one of the other standards is onions we lost everything yes yes yes onions I see that caramelized onions on here chock loaded chock loaded it and again isn't saying that I keep looking at I'm going that is like a mountain of fries I don't know how when they put this down on the table we're like how are you gonna do this I'm like you know what we're just gonna go for it and see what happens but presentation is primo it's already a 10 out of 10 guys how could you say anything against that let's just pick this up and go again that lobster roll action is in effect this is already heavy give 'em that close up right there oh my god oh that aioli oh wow that is bomb that is bomb okay here we go let's get dirty with it I got it oh oh I thought wow that chipotle aioli off the chart for me right now all beef 100% hot dog on this one bacon-wrapped the goodness let me swing this in here just so you guys can see this is really something special right here it's close to a cross-section initially the saltiness of the fries the bacon right there but that aioli sauce with the cheddar cheese is insane I can easily see why this one is a favorite hmm I love the flavor of the dog itself I mean you have so much going on on top them and you really taste that nice crunch and then snap of that dog really nice right there Wow yeah I will admit though the top so much going on is a lot slid off to the side right you gotta be I don't know got to be skilled enough to keep that bad boy on the we're professionals we've been doing this a long time yeah don't try this at home kids but I'm liking this one quick thing I'm a huge fan of ketchup and mayo I know you go the other way with right not really a fan of mayo right but I love this this was made perfectly for me because the ketchup and mayo is mixing into that nice little yeah but still amazing but guys mayo aside obviously aioli is that the heat level that I'm getting on this here on a scale of 1 to 10 I would say it's a little below the mid-range I mean it's a nice sizzle it's a nice slight burn in the back but it doesn't negate any of the other flavors of everything else on this now granted with the bacon bits in there too I mean it is a little on the saltier side because of everything that's got in it there naturally because of what it is but with the fries on top of it and everything this has going we haven't even talked about the lobster roll yet I mean nice crunchy nice crisp on that too I mean that just kind of like sets it off as you're biting in and I'm gonna tell you because I am a huge fan of lobster lobster if I was to eat one thing for the rest of my life it's a main boiled lobster I've eaten my weight in lobster rolls that would be a perfect vessel to hold lobster roll but it's light butteriness to it on that light butteriness yeah yeah it adds to it after this whole thing but little sloppy but at the same time all the flavor just meshing together it's a little dirty is what it is little dirty is way I know a lot of sound bites in this video mmm man I am really blown away by just the amount of this it really is something else there okay we went into this thinking we weren't gonna give this a rating because we just wanted to experience it naturally kind of like a mukbang style of having something to eat first time trying this place here in Pasadena for me that I live locally the endorsement from being out of town but I think I am gonna give this a rating straight out and I think the obvious rating that I think you know what it's gonna be is an easy 10 out of 10 and I'm basing that exactly on the execution of what this is now it is on the messier side but what you are getting here is a lot of flavor really cool presentation and guys who doesn't like a bacon-wrapped hot dog that's made very nicely I mean you can really taste a vibrant flavor of the beef in this it's not drowned out by all the other flavors on this so I can see why this is an LA favorite apparently what they're advertising with this one I'm glad I gave this one a shot about yours yeah I'm uh I'm on board I'm on board with this totally um and you made a great point just kind of circling around the bun that buttered bun bringing everything together just that crunch and a little bit of butter working with everything yeah just makes it stand out a little bit more so I'm definitely a fan what are we talking on price on this mine was $6.75 $7.75 I believe for mine in that ballpark range so about about average but what you get you're getting quality for what you're getting you the price point is not really outrageous and considering Old Town Pasadena where we are right now a little bit more of a premium with some of the things it's pretty competitive I think for something fast casual you can get into with like gastropub quality which they also have IPA options here they have a lot of different things you can do as well as a variety of hot sauces too which is pretty awesome yeah and a nice vibe inside if you like old-school hip hop they had jump around was playing yeah and there was something else and if you saw in the wall there were some murals of I think Ice Cube and a couple of other rappers out there were spray-painted on the wall nice little vibe a loud music loud music yeah that likes you know needed to stamp our hands going in front I didn't get my armband we want hit over there yeah but re-enter we're definitely coming back to it I can already tell you I think before you head out I think we should probably make a return trip here this quality is pretty nice to have a few other things on the menu I think I'd like to come back and try as well but hey considering how amazing this is right now I know mine is I don't think we actually had yours being given a rating right no I was too caught up in the whole excitement of it I'm gonna get this that's a solid 8.5 it's a solid 8.5 excellent I enjoy it I would come back to it does it is it worthy of the house special name I really don't know what that means I'm just keeping it real like you could call anything your house especially you open up a place house dog you and I open up a food truck we call anything the house special so I'm okay with it if that's the way they want to go I'm okay with it I like I enjoy it but that I don't even know how you pulled that off because I'm looking at that still saying I don't just a professionally professionally you already know well guys do me a quick favor drop some comments down below let me know if this is something that you think you'd personally like to try do you have anything like this in the area where you guys actually go I'm a very curious to know there's a lot of different variations of hot dog recipes hot dog styles but naturally with the presentation and something like this this feels very LA I got to be honest and I really love the presentation of it there but drop some comments down below let me know what you guys personally think of what you just saw today and before we wrap this one up we also wanted to highlight the agua frescas pretty cool here we actually have a watermelon variant what do you actually have I'm rocking pineapple pineapple but let's give this a shot real fast here cheers cheers salut oh that's legit that is legit I'm like oh I'm feeling hydrated I'm hydrated steel-drums that is really good it is straight up crushed watermelon absolutely nothing else in this obviously with the pineapple for you that's got it looks like it's straight pineapple juice yeah it's pineapple juice but it's not as sugary so it is that effect of the you know water mixed with the pineapple juice was what we're talking like the essence of it there I've actually got a little bit of the seeds it feels like it's floating around in there I mean this is legit this really is so dirt dog made for LA straight out it is it really really is hmm all right guys this was a lot of fun to do here in Old Town Pasadena with the endorsement coming in from the East Coast super glad to actually have
