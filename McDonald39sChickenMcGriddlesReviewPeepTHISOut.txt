 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty McDonald's maybe going all-in on all day breakfast chicken sandwiches but apparently only in limited markets around the country that's right and we're going in on one of them right here it's the chicken McGriddles featuring two main ingredients that I think everybody should recognize almost instantly here starting off with the McDonald's logo on top you've got the McGriddles themselves that syrup infused pancake goodness nice and fluffy guys I have to admit very very nice we have that McChicken underneath here a foreign piece of chicken hand breaded with seasoned spices as you guys can see exactly the same thing in the regular McChicken and on the very bottom of that the very bottom of the McGriddles so no sauce at all as you guys can see I guess they're depending upon the syrup on the inside of the McGriddle to give that little extra umph to this one but it looks pretty decent and honestly I think an idea whose time has finally come let's see if the flavor delivers on this one it's the chicken McGriddles here at McDonald's let's peep out this flavor so are you a fan of high quality delicious looking food reviews well if so definitely hit that subscribe button down below and don't forget to tap that Bell icon so you can be notified as soon as new content drops every week now let's dive into this one you know I'm really digging the syrupy aroma in my car right now and it's really helping to distract me from the fact that it's well over 100 plus degrees outside of my car as I'm filming this as I've been saying my last few videos it's just crazy in Southern Cali let's see if this one is going to deliver on the taste though to keep that distraction going it's the chicken McGriddles for a limited time here at McDonald's mmm keep distracting mmm you know I was expecting the creaminess of that McGriddles to be there considering the syrup is infused on the inside top and bottom of this one so that's delivering the moisture believe it or not to this overall sandwich the juiciness of the chicken itself is a little on the dry side but it is crispy it is fried so there's a little bit of oil there but guys the combination actually works I'm kind of getting a vibe of like chicken and waffles strictly because of the maple like syrup and the chicken let's go for another bite and I'll give you that close up mmm now I get mcchickens every once in a while typically without mayo but I have them add a little ranch to it so the chicken flavor itself is very familiar to me it's that formed piece of chicken as I was mentioning earlier with that light crispy outer coating seasoning it's not too bad a little bit of heat from the pepper but overall it's just a basic value chicken sandwich on the top and bottom though that's gonna be the real star of the show because the smooth creaminess that I'm getting from the syrup and the pancake batter together really light this one up to really give you a nice little chicken and waffles type situation and I got to say the flavor works guys it really works very nicely yeah there is really no need for anything else to be on the sandwich no cheese no other type of sauce necessary because of that syrup action that it's adding to the party with this that is really the main star of the show on top of the McGriddles themselves and that's should the value patty that you're getting from the big chicken I think most of us know what to expect from that you already heard my breakdown of it but guys it's tasty and for a breakfast alternative outside of the typical egg and sausage this is a pretty cool thing actually it really is so one last final look at this one as we go 360 around on this and I have to admit I really loved the appearance of the fried chicken portion of it along with the pancake goodness here guys it's actually a very nice contrast overall and the flavor does deliver and again it's all about that syrup that is really adding to the overall coating of the McChicken patty itself that's what really makes this one on top of the nice smooth creaminess of that pancake batter really really nice oh and if you're wondering what's up with that McChicken biscuit that you saw in the opening footage of my review right now have no fear that's one of the next reviews coming up very very soon but if you want to check out something right now hit the link down below in the description box to my buddy the endorsement who's got his video live as we speak when you jump on over they're definitely telling him Ian K sent ya so as for the chicken McGriddles yes it's familiar yes it's very basic but when you combine them together I have to admit it's a combination that works extremely well the creaminess of that McGriddles batter that they're using in those pancake top and bottoms work extremely well with that syrup and the crispy coating of the McChicken itself and the semi juiciness of the white meat really deliver a very very tasty combination you can't beat it especially when it's 2 for 3 bucks guys it's a buck 50 each so with that said I'm gonna have to give the chicken mcgriddles here at McDonald's a pretty decent 8 out of 10 it's not something I would get often considering I have to be really in the mood for breakfast food but the combination like I said works very well and if you want something a little sweet little crispy it's a pretty good alternative but of course the question is are you gonna give this one a shot do you happen to live in a market that actually is offering this right now because even if you don't you can still technically have this one made for you drop some comments down below let me know what you thought of this one overall and with that this is Ian K closing out another episode of peep this out bringing you brand-new content every single week here on my channel so while stay tuned for that next if you coming real soon in the meantime stay frosty you know the bacon egg and cheese mcgriddles is still my favorite out of the group but it's awesome to have choices and the McChicken variant is definitely a great choice alright everyone until next time I'll talk to you soon but before you go and just in case you haven't already take a look at the last review that I put out right up over here alone what I think YouTube is gonna recommend for you to check out as well as
