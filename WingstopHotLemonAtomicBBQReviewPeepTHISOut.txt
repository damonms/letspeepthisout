 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty wingstop rounds out July with its final two flavors as part of their 25 days of flavor promo but did it save the best for last so let's find out as we go in and the hot lemon and the atomic BBQ too heated flavor is about to go at it and I have to admit the aroma in my car is pretty nice right now along with it being very steamy I have a feeling this is gonna be a sizzling situation starting off over here with the hot lemon we're doing bone in this time guys we've got a combination of their original hot and lemon pepper and I got to say that contrast looks really really nice and as for the atomic BBQ hickory-smoked goodness mixed in with their atomic flavor and you guys all remember the dragon's breath that atomic is no joke again we're going bone in with these as well very saucy very heated and I'm loving the contrast between the colors here guys let's not waste any more time these are the final two flavors of the 25

saving these two heated flavors for the very end of July when it's probably the hottest time to be reviewing this right now so we pull up one of these drumettes the hot lemon guys here we go pray for me mmm oh it's nice oh oh oh that lemon came up fast with the heat and that was like a hot sizzle right away with the citric acid from the lemon and the heated OG goodness that this one's got already on it guys nice combination because lemon pepper is one of my favorite flavors if not my most favorite flavor anyway but that heat is pretty tasty on it mmm well I am definitely earning my food review stripes with this one guys filming this one in the weather that I am right now it is a glutton for punishment and the sizzle on this one is only priming me for the next flavor I have a feeling but take a look at that I love the contrast of the pepper on this one you can really see that OG heat kickin really nicely on the outside it's nice and red and a meatines of the bone in is pretty awesome guys really delicious man I literally feel like I'm taking a shower in my car right now the joys of reviewing food during the summer time I got to tell you let's go into this ranch right now guys because I really need to cool it down my mouth is literally lit up ridiculously like it's Christmas yeah let's cool this one down because the sizzle is absolutely heated you got to live the thick goodness of the ranch over here at wingstop I think this contrast looks really nice on top of the chicken wing what do you guys think drop some comments down below let me know what you think of the appearance in this one as I get into it mmm Ranch is amazing it cools it down so nicely but still let's the flavors of that lemon and that heated goodness come through loud and clear I love the creaminess of it the light tartness of it as well and just overall really delicious stuff mmm yesir let me give you another shot at this hot lemon here to give you an idea of that texture a little bit more up close guys as you can see nice peppery goodness and I have to admit again that sauce is pretty awesome mixed in with the lemon pepper it is nicely heated not too crazy heated but just initially of a shock up front and then a nice sizzle burn right after that this is really a tasty flavor so before we get into that atomic BBQ let me go for one more of these hot lemons straight up without any ranch to see if I could take the whole thing down in one bite mm-hmm professionally Wow and that was a pretty meaty wing too almost like a baby turkey wing to be honest guys it was pretty thick all right atomic BBQ action here we go oh Hickory barbecue wait a minute that barbecue is keeping that atomic flavor at bay I'm very surprised by that I thought we were gonna have some fire action going here right now the sweetness of that Hickory barbecue sauce is really kind of muting the atomic flavor but then again that sizzle is coming to you right now little remnants I think of the previous one they're from that hot lemon but guys still very tasty mm-hmm you know I'm really feeling the burn overall thanks to the heatness that I'm dealing with in the inside of my car in addition to that spiciness of that hot lemon and then the light light heat that I'm getting from the atomic barbecue here guys even with that Hickory sauce that's kind of muting the flavor the overall sizzle is elevated so don't get me wrong it's definitely hot but not as hot as I was expecting like the dragon's breath still very tasty though all right since this is already feeling muted to begin with I think when we go into the ranch we know what to expect right let's go for that dip look at that sexy saucy wing dipping into some nice Cool Ranch let's light this one up and go for that taste you know my lips are sizzling so much right now is actually getting a little bit hard for me to talk so let's just get into this mmm mmm oh my god well as expected some nice creamy Cool Ranch action bringing down the heat even further although the heat is still elevated because it's the atomic flavor but guys it is noticeably different compared to the dragon's breath this is really more of a hickory sweet style with a little bit more elevated heat but as I'm finding the hot lemon is actually a little bit more of a shocker up front with a nice sizzle after that this is more of like the creeper but a little bit more heated after the sweetness of the Hickory but still pretty tasty hmm well it's really messy but in the best most possible way I'm definitely digging the Hickory barbecue sauce here a wingstop and I have to admit the addition of the atomic really does take it up just a bit naturally as you'd expect it to but not enough to really make it unbearable to eat like the dragon's breath but guys this is still really delicious but still again the hot lemon is absolutely my favorite out of the two okay so I think you know by now which one I actually prefer overall between the two so as for the scores I'm gonna have to give the hot lemon over here a wingstop a rock-solid 10 out of 10 guys the flavor was pretty much on point right from the get-go with that one that spice hit me right away the lemon pepper was the familiar flavor and that OG heat was pretty awesome it's the best overall flavor I think out of the group that I've tried and I have to admit it goes amazingly well with ranch as it usually does I mean it's lemon pepper and it's my favorite flavor and I love getting it with ranch but when it comes to the atomic barbecue that one's gonna get a pretty decent 8.5 out of 10 it's really up there in terms of flavor because the Hickory barbecue sauce is pretty amazing but it's muted slightly in the atomic heat Department strictly because of the flavor of the barbecue sauce it's really really strong and very rich and although the heat does elevate and get you there it's not right away and it wasn't what I was expecting but still very very delicious either way now of course this is gonna lead me to ask you have you tried any of these brand new remixed flavors over here at Wingstop now that I've reviewed all six of them drop those comments down below and let me
