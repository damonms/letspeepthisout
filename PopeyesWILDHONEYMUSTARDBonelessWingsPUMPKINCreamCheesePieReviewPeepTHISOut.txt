deja vu comes in we've got some wild honey mustard sauce and we'll talk more about that as the review goes on but definitely a spiced up honey mustard for sure this is definitely gonna be pretty awesome and for dessert check this out I decided to go with their pumpkin cream cheese pie and I have to admit this is a little on the small side basically a turnover style pastry stuffed with pumpkin and cream cheese looking pretty decent at least in that department there because the outside looks nice and crispy I have to say topped off with cinnamon and sugar but a little on the small side I have to say here guys but for a sweet treat to finish this one out we'll definitely go for it and give it a shot let's see if this one delivers in the flavor though this is the wild honey mustard boneless wings promo along with the pumpkin cream cheese pie from Popeyes let's peep out this flavor yeah this chicken is looking and smelling pretty lovely right now and I can't wait to get into it with some of this familiar wild honey mustard sauce along with checking out that pumpkin cream cheese pie I think that's gonna be pretty good as well but as always before we get started if you guys are fans of high-quality delicious looking food reviews make sure to hit that subscribe button down below and don't forget to tap the Bell icon so you can be notified as soon as new content drops every week now guys I reviewed their boneless wings a million times in the past and all the different variations they've come out with over the years so let me go for a quick bite of this solo before the sauce to give you a breakdown and then we'll get further into it mmm always a treat starting off with the obvious the nice crunchiness on the outside of the coating itself a little bit of the spice the marinated seasoning coming through very familiar Popeyes as usual nice juicy white meat on the inside as well too and that's usually not the case and I don't mean not the case in terms of Popeyes I mean in general because white meat tends to be a little bit drier than normal and I have to admit this is still pretty juicy so one more bite of this one they close up and then you know we're gonna get into some sauce right after let's go for it mmm you can kind of see a little bit of the redness on the outside of the chicken itself guys but as you can see a very decent amount of white meat and the coating is nice and crispy fried up to a crispy golden brown as always and always just a very lovely situation lots of tasty goodness and the very familiar Popeyes flavor and given that this is typically normally a $5 promo as it's been in the past the fact that it's $5.99 means we have just a little bit more pieces of chicken in here so we've got seven pieces total and I'm not hating on that at all guys really tasty mmm all right so this wild honey mustard sauce and that sense of deja vu that I'm telling you guys about this is actually something that came out about three years ago with the Southern fair chicken tenders that I actually reviewed you guys can take a look at that review popping up on your screen right now this is my second favorite dipping sauce of all time well the honey mustard version is the spiced version which is essentially what this is is the wild portion so I love honey mustard it holds a special place in my heart ranch is obviously my number one but with this being kicked up with spice I'm excited to see if that flavor is gonna translate the same way as it did back then with the southern fair chicken tenders because that was a very cool outer coating to have with the spicy honey mustard but let's go for it and see well hopefully you can kind of see on the inside this is pretty much the standard honey mustard but there are little bits of red flakes kind of spread out throughout here to give you a little bit of that spice that's where the wilds coming from obviously it's nice and thick standard honey mustard goodness that really soaks up into the nooks and crannies of the boneless wing let's confirm that flavor for you man I love the smell of honey mustard let's do it mm-hmm exactly the same thing it's good with the standard coating though on the outside and while I did actually prefer the sauce with the outside coating of the southern fair chicken tenders I believe it was like a cornmeal type coating this is actually really good with the standard goodness because it's still honey mustard with just a little bit of heat but it's so minor but it's tasty it's really good though all right let me go for another nugget here because why not since this is the main focus of this review essentially to give this one a go the familiarity is there the flavor is definitely there it's nice and sweet nice rich honey mustard flavor with just a little bit of heat in the backend but very very little mmm yup here's another quick shot of one of these boneless wings guys as you can see a very decent amount of white meat on the inside and a very decent amount of coating on most of them as well some are a little bit heavier than others but generally a very solid piece of meat for sure and of course you have that wild honey mustard sauce to go with on top there just a nice combination overall and a nice retread of what was really a tasty sauce back then not bad all right now this pumpkin cream cheese pie let me crack this for you here it's very messy there is plenty of cinnamon sugar from top to bottom but as you guys can see there there is the filling on the inside looks like two strips of that goodness down the middle right there lots of hollowness though that's the only thing but a decent amount that's probably a better shot for you you've got that spiced pumpkin puree goodness on the side there and some cream cheese filling to go with and that turnover style crust as you can see is loaded with cinnamon and sugar let's give this a go very messy to break this apart in the car guys let's go for that bite mmm the cream cheese is strong on this mmm it's almost a little too strong for me because typically pumpkin should be the dominant player with this one with the cream cheese coming up as the accent I mean pumpkin is the first name and the title of this one so I'm expecting it to be a little bit stronger but it's a subtle spice pumpkin puree not super sweet most of the sweetness is coming from the cinnamon sugar and the fried crispiness that's blending with that is actually very nice from the outside turnover style crust but that cream cheese is super strong guys super strong let me give you a little bit of a closer shot of that filling guys as you can see it's a very decent amount and obviously wrapped in that dough it's not a bad portion I have to say especially towards the end of it the cracked piece that I did in the middle was a little bit more Hollow on one side but as you can see this is pretty filled lots of that pumpkin goodness and of course that cream cheese which is really lighting it up but the highlight for me is actually the cinnamon sugar and that fried goodness on the outside with a turnover style shell guys it's actually very flavorful and I have to admit not bad considering it's a little on the small side buck twenty nine is not bad for this but nice quality in the overall flavor Department you know this is kind of reminding me of that pumpkin and creme pie that I reviewed from McDonald's back in a day which you guys can find on the upper right-hand corner of your display as well but I have to say that one was a little bit bigger in terms of the overall size and I liked the way it had like that lattice type cut on the very top this is more of like a traditional fried type of pastry but it's smaller but the quality of the pumpkin is good I only wish it was just a little bit stronger compared to the overall flavor of the cream cheese I'm not really a super cream cheese fan but that flavor is really standing out above the pumpkin but it's tasty guys it really is I wanted to bite off a piece of this crust from the second half to give you a better idea of that other piece that I broke up for you guys and as you can see it still has a very decent amount of filling it's the middle that tends to be a little bit higher a little bit more hollow but the ends are definitely packed with the goodness here so very nice quality on this one but considering the size I'd probably recommend getting 2 if you're a pumpkin fan it is a little on the small side like I said but if you like cinnamon and sugar this thing is absolutely loaded with it I mean just look at the amount that's all over my fingers this is definitely lit up very nice alright so I got to be honest this wild honey mustard boneless wings promo feels like a little bit of a holdover to what I think may be the actual promo coming next month with something brand new but it's nice to see the return of a sauce that they use in the past along with the standard coating that they're used to over here naturally throwing it into a box with a side of biscuit and making seven boneless wings out of it $5.99 is a pretty okay price for what you're getting there and hey if you love honey mustard I think you know what to expect with this one but when it comes to being wild I probably wouldn't call it wild I'd probably call it mildly excited guys because it's just a little spicy but nothing crazy at all so with that said I'm gonna have to give the wild honey mustard boneless wings here at Popeyes just an OK 7.5 out of 10 there's really nothing new with this one guys aside from the flavor being pretty familiar with honey mustard and a little bit of spices added to it it's really the promotional thing of what it is in general and the price point being for what you get but aside from that it's just all right and when it comes to that pumpkin cream cheese pie that's gonna get a pretty solid 8.3 out of 10 the only thing that really hit this one for me at least personally was the fact that the cream cheese was a little bit stronger than the actual pumpkin the size being what it is is a little bit of a factor I mean a dollar twenty nine I know it's small but at the same time it could be just a little bit bigger for the money with a little bit more flavor in the pumpkin Department I mean pumpkin is the first name in a title right but overall a definite sweet treat and being that I'm a fan of pumpkin I really was glad to check that out in addition to these wild honey mustard boneless wings it was a pretty fun promo to check out today now the question is are you gonna check any of these out drop some comments down below are you gonna be heading over to Popeyes to give any of these a try and if you are what are you most excited to give a shot first
