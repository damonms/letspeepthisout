 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty pizza pizza what's going on   everyone welcome back to another high quality  foodie feature for you here on the channel   cheaters cam style after hours over at little  caesars because an iconic menu favorite's back   on the menu for a limited time only and this  time around it's available a little differently   and i'll of course explain so let's get into  it feast your eyes on the stuffed pretzel crust   with pizza sauce and i have to admit guys this  is looking just as glorious as i remember the   last couple of times that i've tried this pizza  so what we've got here is a large cheese stuffed   soft pretzel crust with that butter wash and salt  in the back guys a lovely situation it definitely   stands out along with plenty of pepperoni as you  can see we've got mozzarella cheese on this one   their usual blend of cheese over here at little  caesars and underneath it is a cheddar cheese   sauce and that's obviously one of the highlights  with this one but you can also get it with pizza   sauce now and obviously as you're seeing on the  screen we've got a nice little portion of it here   in this little container guys a very decent  amount and i think that should all dovetail   nicely into all the cheese that you'll find in  the very back of the crust itself guys definitely   a nice ring of mozzarella goodness going around  this one and i'm very excited to get into this   so yes we've got some iconic deliciousness on tap  to get into here guys very excited like i said and   as always it is a challenge to film pizza in the  car but i'm going to do my best for you right now   very excited to give this a go here let me pull  up one of these pieces and man that is greasiness   already guys feast your eyes again there a lovely  situation in terms of the presentation i love the   salted accent in the back and as you guys can see  try and get that lighting just a little better for   you there we've got that crust action filled  with cheese in there try and keep that focus   with the lighting but as you can see a lovely  situation and again the grease and butteriness   is real on this one guys a lovely situation  let's not waste any more time let's do it   it's the all-new returning stuffed pretzel crust  with pizza sauce here at little caesars here we go oh how i've missed you the cheddar cheese  sauce is very creamy on this guys and i have   a few stragglers in terms of the salt mixing  in with it and it's a lovely situation indeed   just a banging combination and of course the  pepperoni to go with guys standard little   caesars pizza but the cheddar cheese sauce  really makes this one and that's obviously   without even getting into the crust just yet  which we're about to do so let me go for one   more bite of this one and then we're gonna  have some fun with that stuffed crust hang on man well i do love me a warm soft pretzel guys  and especially when it's got the salt in the   back here that so makes this right now which is  just a great thing because it's mixing with all   the toppings in the front in this case it's going  to be the mozzarella cheese the cheddar cheese   sauce and the pepperoni so you have a nice  little accent to get you ready for the very   back of it right over here so let's not waste  any more time on this one let's get into that   and you know what before i do let me see  if i can get it ready first here let me   actually pull it apart and see if we can get  a little cheese pull action going right there   well not so much but as you can see we do have  it actually on the inside of the crust you can   actually see it more over there let's  go for a bite of this guys here we go   oh yeah salty mozzarella very nice so authentic  really good and just to pull this apart really   quick here let me just bring the crust up for  you because that really is the star of the show   baked to perfection as always whenever they  do this over here it's absolutely a favorite   and guys that salt is really adding to this  mozzarella cheese on the inside and as you   can see there decent across the board there lovely  situation but guys i got to be honest i was very   surprised with this when i got this because here  i thought i was getting a stuffed pretzel crust   with pizza sauce replacing the cheddar cheese so  naturally as you can imagine i was surprised when   i popped in my coat into the pizza portal to pick  up my pizza and as soon as that little door opened   up and i slid the pizza out i saw there was that  container of pizza sauce on the top and i was like   i thought this was actually on the pizza maybe  instead of the cheddar cheese sauce for people   that didn't want that but guys it's in addition to  that which is kind of cool so you're getting the   standard stuffed pretzel crust pizza as normal  like they make it with the cheddar cheese sauce   but in addition to that you've got some pizza  sauce for dipping action right there so that's   actually a cool thing and the price is the same  i believe it was nine dollars either way so why   wouldn't you get it with the pizza sauce don't be  afraid of getting that one because you're thinking   you're not going to get the cheddar cheese sauce  you're getting that in addition to it which is   kind of cool and since we're on the topic of  talking about that pizza sauce let me just   go for it right now with you and we'll just give  it a dunk so very very nice as you can see there   guys it's nice and thick it's the pizza sauce they  use with their pizza as always let's give it a go oh yeah absolutely come on how could you not get  this with it you know the funny thing about this   the last time i checked this out actually when  it was just the standard stuffed crust variant   of this without the pizza sauce as an add-on  they actually mixed the two together when i   got that variance you're probably gonna see that  popping up on your screen here right now if you   wanted to see there was a little bit more of the  cheddar cheese sauce but just a little bit of   marinara mixed in with it this is so much better  because you can control it and go for that dip so   speaking of which let's go for that badunkadunk  one more time on that very lovely situation on it very nice kind of warm too i'm liking that really  good and because i'm at the end of it right now   let's go for the trifecta here we go another  shot of it for you there very lovely situation   yup yeah so not too much different with this one  this time out aside from the fact that you can get   the sauce on the side but guys a very fun time  giving this a go for you right now let me pull   up another slice just to show you and as you can  see plenty of cheese in the very back of this one   here if you don't get the stuffed crust there is  seriously something wrong with you you got to do   the stuffed it's definitely awesome and as you can  see a very decent amount of that pepperoni action   to go with here guys a lovely situation in general  and overall i'm so glad to see this back on the   menu until the end of march i believe this is  something you definitely want to give a go on and   i have a feeling you're going to because you're  watching this review right come on now you know   you're going to do it pretzel crust is back with  a cheddar cheese sauce and a soft pretzel crust   for just six bucks a pizza well as you can tell i  thoroughly enjoy this one right now as i expected   to considering my last time out with it there guys  a very delicious iconic pizza over here at little   caesars and honestly they're kind of synonymous  with the pretzel crust officially because they do   it very very well and the fact that you can get  it as the regular variant or the stuffed which i   would recommend going for obviously there you can  also get it with or without the pizza sauce now   i understand it's not the actual sauce they're  replacing it's in addition to it there i think   they need to be just a little bit more clearer about  that in the advertising at least on the website   anyway but even still guys a lovely situation  and i'm glad to have given this one a shot   again even though i was kind of wishing that  pizza sauce was pretty much going to replace   the cheddar cheese sauce because i really wanted  to try that full dynamic of a standard pizza with   the pretzel crust but even still pretty delicious  guys pretty delicious so with that said i'm going   to have to give the returning stuff pretzel crust  with pizza sauce a rock solid 10 out of 10 guys   you knew it was coming right i mean how could it  not the flavor is iconic the saltiness is perfect   and that combination of the mozzarella blend along  with the cheddar cheese sauce is primo right there   of course the nice toastiness of the bread in  the back that pretzel is emulated very nicely   and i keep coming back to it the saltiness  is just on point because of the sprinkled   salt there i'm just i love the fact that  it just blended in with everything else   and it was so good dipping it into the pizza sauce  a no-brainer come on get that on the side you're   going to thank me for it it's awesome all right so  now the obvious question because i already know a   lot of you guys are going to be running to give  this one a go right now i mean after all people   have been pleading and begging to have this back  on the menu for so long and now that it's here how   could you not give it a go right so with that in  mind drop some comments down below and let me know   how many times do you plan on having it during  the promotional period between now and the end   of march 2021 i'm very curious to know how many  times you're going to be heading back to little   caesars to give this one a go whatever variant  of it you get it doesn't really matter just let   me know how many times do you plan on having this  pizza right now drop those comments down below and   definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K  closing out another high quality foodie feature   for you here on peep this out
