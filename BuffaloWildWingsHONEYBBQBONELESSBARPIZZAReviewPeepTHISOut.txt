toppings   let's break this one on down real fast yup yup the  presentation is definitely on point with this one   alright what we've got here is a thin crust pizza  topped with a laundry list of ingredients starting   off with boneless wings honey barbecue sauce  mozzarella cheese a cheddar and jack cheese blend   medium buffalo sauce bacon pickled hot peppers and  green onions so guys this looks like the epitome   of a fun bar pizza for sure something you'd want  to have on your table while you're watching the   game this is looking really really nice and again  that presentation is killer along with the aroma i   have to say it smells pretty awesome so there you  go it's the all new honey barbecue boneless bar   pizza here at buffalo wild wings let's peep out  this flavor i gotta say i'm really digging how all   these toppings are stacked on this one guys i mean  the boneless chicken pieces along with the pickled   hot peppers look pretty awesome on this one and  considering this actually has medium buffalo   sauce on top of it i'm expecting a little bit of  heat just to be on the safe side i got my trusty   water bottle ready to go all right let me pick up  one of these pieces here and wow this is very nice   cut very beautifully and as you can see glistening  in the sun there plenty of saucy action with this   one guys looking nice and again stacked toppings  that boneless chicken looks pretty awesome on this   a little bit of the dusting that i'm feeling from  the bottom of this one very very nice so here we   go it's the honey barbecue boneless bar pizza  here at buffalo wild wings let's peep this out sweet well right off the break outside of the  sweetness i'm kind of getting a focaccia vibe   with this one guys almost like a flatbread type  of situation i wouldn't say pizza necessarily   but again it's not really a traditional  pizza in that sense but the crunchiness   of the boneless chicken is not bad on this and  a little bit of the heat coming through with   that buffalo sauce i'm not really getting too  much just yet but totally digging the flavor   and of course the honey barbecue is really  standing out on this let's keep going in mmm hot pickled peppers  there it is oh little steamy that's pretty tasty but again a focaccia-like  situation with this and don't get me wrong i like   it it's tasty but again not really a traditional  pizza in that sense i'm not really getting too   much cheese just yet so you know what because  this is an end piece it doesn't really have too   much apparently let me pick up one of the middle  pieces here and give this a shot looks like we've   got more cheesy action here this should be pretty  good but as you can see no shortage of the sauce   guys it's very flavorful and i gotta say i am  totally digging this so far let's keep going in there it is got a little bit of bacon in  that bite guys and it actually adds very   nicely a nice bit of smokiness on  top of the honey barbecue but again   not really pizza like from what i was  expecting here but it's fun i have to admit   for a flat bread focaccia-like situation with some  boneless chicken on here just because it's b-dubs   the peppers are definitely a nice situation as  well and the sweetness of that honey mustard   is definitely up there and as i'm going further  in here it's getting a little steamy hang on so much better i'm so glad that i brought  something on top of it being crazy hot here   in southern cali right now but not bad on  this one guys again now for what the   toppings are on this you're getting some  classic b dub goodness with their sauce   and of course with the boneless chicken so  let's just go for a couple more on this one   i think i've gotten pretty much everything  out of this i'm digging it it's not bad   but pizza that's a little bit of a stretch  let's keep going in for a couple more pizza flatbread focaccia whatever you want to  call this it's still very flavorful guys and again   with that medium buffalo sauce coming through  beautifully with the chicken that's a nice add-on   accent along with those peppers so pretty nice on  this one but i got to admit the cheese is getting   lighter and lighter as i'm going in doesn't really  appear that i have too much on this and you know   what that's a little bit of a shame because i wish  i had just a little bit more cheese to go with and   even though barbecue sauce technically on pizza  is not really my go-to it's okay for what it is   the flavor of the honey barbecue is pretty bomb  on this so let's go for one more bite we'll wrap   the review up with the rating coming up next  but again whatever you want to call this one   pizza flatbread or focaccia it's still pretty  tasty one more bite we'll close it out hang on you know nice presentation aside this one  definitely has some pretty nice flavor and   a decent amount of heat thanks to the medium  buffalo sauce guys and when you combine that   with the sweetness of the honey barbecue sauce  it's a pretty nice situation more of an appetizer   type of thing not necessarily a meal but for what  it is it'll definitely light up your taste buds   with some pretty decent flavor not bad on this one  even if calling a pizza is just a little bit of a   stretch in my opinion buffalo wild wings so with  that said i'm gonna have to give the all-new honey   barbecue boneless bar pizza here at buffalo wild  wings a pretty okay 7 out of 10 like i said guys   calling this a pizza is a little bit of a stretch  but what you're getting quality wise in terms of   the flavor is gonna be pretty tasty it's got a  decent amount of heat thanks to the medium buffalo   sauce and the combination of that honey barbecue  sauce to go with is a nice combination i just wish   i had a little bit more cheese on it naturally  and overall just overall of feeling more of   like a pizza like i said more of a focaccia-like  situation with that very thin on the crust and   i did like that actually because it's nice and  crunchy nice and crisp but again maybe if there   was just a little bit more cheese on it i think i  would have been more inclined to maybe call this   one a pizza or at least give me more of that vibe  but even still very flavorful for what it is and   for $9.99 not too bad for the price point all right  so do me a favor like always drop some comments   down below let me know what you thought of this  particular one i mean have you given this one   a shot over here at b dubs already did it satisfy  your expectations in terms of flavor and maybe the   value for $9.99 drop those comments down below and  definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K   closing out another high quality foodie feature  for you here on peep this out
