yeah peep this out can i get that new a1 double cheeseburger with light mayo and that's it okay light mayo you got it perfect drive forward great thank you so much all right so that steakhouse angus thickburger was definitely fun to check out take a look at that review popping up over here if you haven't seen it already very tasty yeah hey my friend how you doing tonight good you very good thank you awesome thanks so much appreciate you stay frosty alright guys let's peep this out so here we go with the little brother of the steakhouse angus thickburger the a1 double cheeseburger and i gotta say i'm already digging the size of those charbroiled patties peeking out the sides of this one guys this is actually looking pretty good underneath the bun obviously we've got that a1 steak sauce and plenty of melted swiss cheese and that's actually separated also in between those two beef patties as you can see there charbroiled goodness definitely a lovely situation underneath that looks like we've got the obvious two crispy onion rings which could be the wild card with this one it's looking pretty good and if you look closely you'll see that shaker shake shake stuff that i like to call it there the steak seasoning it's looking really nice as well with a little bit of light mayo but overall guys i gotta say this is a simple build on this one but it looks really really tasty and definitely sizeable for the money let's see if the flavor is going to deliver on this one it's the all-new a1 double cheeseburger here at carl's jr let's peep out this flavor all right so yeah how could i not swing on back to give this one a shot guys i mean one of the major gripes that i had with that steakhouse angus thickburger was the fact that although the red onion was good it needed to be crispy and naturally this has actually got those onion actions right there as you can see two of them on the inside and plenty of swiss cheese and of course the a1 steak sauce it's a simple build but it looks like a very meaty double cheeseburger and i'm excited to get into it just for that reason alone all right so before i dive into this one to hopefully confirm the awesomeness that this burger is and like always if you guys are fans of high quality delicious looking food reviews make sure to hit that subscribe button down below and don't forget to tap that bell icon so you can be notified as soon as brand new content drops every week guys here we go the a1 double cheeseburger here at carl's jr after hours let's do it instantly instantly right off the break this is already way up on top guys the onion rings on top of all the beefy goodness goes a long way with that a1 steak sauce on top of it after that first bite as you can see a very lovely situation and the patties are fairly juicy believe it or not i was a little worried there they looked a little dry when i was looking at that close up but guys that is a lovely situation the steak seasoning on top of it is very flavorful a little on the salty side but i gotta say it complements nicely with the onion rings and of course the a1 steak sauce very vibrant very rich and just overall delicious let's keep going in on it it's pretty good oh yeah oh yeah those two slices of swiss on this easily make the difference on top of everything that i'm talking about already strictly because that while it's not very super rich in flavor with swiss it's a little bit more milder for me with this one anyway it's definitely creamier so it's adding the creamy factor on top of the beefy factor the saucy factor because the flavor is coming through now granted there's not a lot of a1 steak sauce on this but what is there is pungent so you're definitely going to get that right up front and of course with the onion rings on top of it guys come on it's a tasty double cheeseburger charbroiled and definitely a delicious situation let's go for another bite this is really really tasty oh yeah yeah that shaky shaky steaky steaky goodness is definitely a lovely situation guys that powdered goodness on the very bottom along with the onion rings and that a1 steak sauce really take this one up big time the crispy onion rings are really adding that nice crunch and honestly i am enjoying this more than the flagship believe it or not and this is actually less expensive it's definitely a hearty situation and overall a very very tasty burger as you can see here a lovely situation in the beef and cheese department you know i gotta say take off the tomato from that steakhouse angus thickburger and replace the red onion with these onion rings and that would have been an easy easy 10 right there but as it stands this is making a serious run for that 10 spot guys because of what this is like i said it's simple it doesn't need tomato and honestly it really is not even necessary on something like this you want the showcase to be on the beef and the a1 sauce and it's a good choice with that swiss cheese because it's mild enough just to give you the creamy factor that you're having some cheese with it it's a double cheeseburger but it's the beefy flavor and the flavor from that a1 steak sauce with the onion rings that are just taking us up total trifecta across the board with this and it's delicious guys it really is alright so let's go for one more bite before we close this one out but as you can tell this is an absolute winner right now and it's literally half the price of the original steakhouse angus thickburger the current version of it for 2020 being that it actually came out a few years back about 10 years ago granted with crispy onions too this i'm telling you i am going to be back for very very good one more bite we'll finish this one out look at that meaty cheesy goodness right there guys and we're gonna go 360 with this one because why not let's just do it as you can see the crispy onion rings are definitely taking this one up and i love the fact that the meat itself is peeking out all around the bun so it could be a psychological thing because the bun's a little bit smaller than the flagship for obvious reasons it's a smaller burger but i gotta say the burger itself is almost in terms of the thickness right up there with the main one that's more expensive but as you can see guys a very lovely situation and an easy recommendation to try guys this is really really good definitely give this a shot if you've got carl's in your area so with that said i'm going to have to give the a1 double cheeseburger here at carl's jr a rock solid 9.5 out of 10 guys that's actually a better burger than the steakhouse angus thickburger on its own that's just my opinion of course but i gotta say everything about that is a highlight and those onion rings really set this one off the flavor of the beef just everything in general it's literally about half the price and it seems just as satisfying if not more so because of that fact there and like i said again those onion rings the onion rings the onion rings the crispy goodness with that with the a1 steak sauce is amazing along with the shakety shake of the steaky goodness that they put on this as well that's really a nice touch too okay now the obvious question based upon my review right now and if you've got a carls jr in the area drop some comments down below are you personally going to be giving this one a shot i would highly recommend that you do and if you have given it a shot how would you compare it to say the steakhouse angus thickburger maybe from back in the day if you've ever had it or
