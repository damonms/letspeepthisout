new limited time only  promo that's right and because you already know   what it is it's the black bean cantina crispy  melt taco so stay tuned because it's up next   welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty so here it is the black bean cantina crispy melt  taco here at taco bell and already the tone is   being set by that really awesome looking fried  white corn shell guys i have to admit i'm getting   some restaurant vibes with this one and i'm really  digging the fact that it looks oversized as well   all right so breaking this one down with  the good stuff on the inside what we've   got here is a combination of a three cheese  blend melted nacho cheese sauce black beans   reduced fat sour cream shredded lettuce diced  tomatoes and on the very top to garnish it all   some shredded cheddar cheese so definitely  a nice combination and it's pretty colorful   all right so let's not waste any more time  on this one we're getting into it it's the   black bean cantina crispy melt taco here  at taco bell let's peep out this flavor   yes sir we're about to get into some cheesy  crispy action with this one and you better   believe i'm gonna be making use of the sleeve  this time out the last time i actually was here   when i reviewed the cantina crispy melt taco which  you're probably noticing that jumping up on your   screen here right now i actually bit into this  without the sleeve i lost some stuff off the back   some stuff on the top naturally i'm not making  that same mistake again because guys this is   definitely loaded and again look at all that good  stuff there the beans look awesome i'm definitely   a fan of black beans but when you mix it with the  nacho cheese sauce the three cheese blend goodies   here this is looking like it's gonna be pretty  fantastic all right enough talking let's get down   to business this is the all new black bean cantina  crispy melt taco here to talk about let's do it man so good that was a front-loaded blast of  tasty delicious nacho cheese action mixed in   with those beans guys i didn't get too much of  the sour cream just yet just a little bit at the   end but take a look at that there is a lot more  cheese on this particular one than the first time   around when i was here to check out the other  version with the beef but a lovely situation   all the classic flavors and again it dovetails  beautifully with that fried white outer corn shell   just a lovely situation here i am definitely  digging this one already and i gotta say again   i'm getting some pretty serious restaurant vibes  with this one even though i've got the fast food   vibe going with it naturally with the six main  ingredients that taco bell loves to recycle it's   all those familiar flavors but with that crispy  goodness on the outside it really feels more like   an upper scale type of taco and i'm really digging  that and again all the cheesy action along with   those black beans on the inside goes amazingly  well let's keep going in guys this is pretty tasty some more money shots for you as you can see a  lovely amount of cheese beginning to ooze out   of this one guys and again that shell is really  setting the tone beautifully with everything on   the inside i'm not missing the seasoned beef  at all with this the black beans are nice and   smooth they're velvety they're rich and i'm really  digging the quality just a lovely situation here   and just to show you real quick i wasn't kidding  when i said you need the sleeve for the very back   of this there is a lot of stuff falling off here  guys and you really want to make sure you've got   some protection here but even still i'm really  digging the fact that as messy as it is i've got   a little bit of protection here on top of just  enjoying the deliciousness of that cheese that's   about to drip got it delicious really really good  stuff guys i'm just going to keep showing this   to you as much as i can it's an oversized crispy  fried taco that really sets the tone on this one   and i'm absolutely digging it yeah it's great  to have some choices on the taco bell menu for   sure and being that you can also get this one with  the seasoned beef which i reviewed recently again   you do have some options to customize this  naturally so you can pretty much make this   any way that you wish with just a la carte on its  own as it's advertised a pretty banging addition   with these black beans guys like i said i'm a fan  of the black beans over here and this goes amazing   just an awesome protein choice and the flavor  definitely delivers on them all right so let's go   for one more bite on this one because i think i've  covered just about everything i can talk about   with this considering the last review that i did  it's really the same exact thing naturally just   with the beans instead of the seasoned beef but  even still i'm so glad to have given this one a   shot and especially on a day where it's not crazy  hot either i'm definitely digging the overcast   weather here in southern cali one more bite we'll  close it out hang out well here's a quick shot of   the back here after cleaning it up just a bit but  as you can see it is really packed with the good   stuff and the fried outer coating is amazing on  this the white corn is nice and crunchy it goes   amazingly well with everything on the inside and  again it is plentiful for about $2.20 or so $2.19 here   in southern cali this is not a bad deal guys very  delicious and i'm really glad this one's out right   now just delicious stuff all around order ahead  and pick yours up at our contactless drive-thru   yes sir definitely a lot of fun checking out the  veggie version of this all new cantina crispy   melt taco over here at taco bell so with that said  i'm going to have to give this black bean variant   a pretty solid 9 out of 10 guys like i said the  flavor delivers across the board all the amazing   flavors of taco bell that you know combine to give  you that familiarity of course that you know but   naturally when you add the black beans into the  mix along with that fried white corn outer shell   just a lovely situation it's hearty you can dive  into it it's oversized and i think personally   worth at least two bucks $2.20 at the most really  really good stuff definitely give this one a shot   all right so being that you've got a couple of  official choices here on the menu when it comes   to these cantina crispy melt tacos here at taco  bell which are you going to be trying first if   you haven't given any of them a shot just yet are  you going to start off with the seasoned beef or   is the black bean more on your radar right now  drop those comments down below and
