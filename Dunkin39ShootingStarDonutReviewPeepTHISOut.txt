 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty hey everyone I'm back at it appropriately filming this one cheaters cam style after hours at dunkin donuts to take a look at the brand new donut they've got on the menu that looks to be the companion to the comet candy donut that I did about a year ago that's right now we've got the shooting star donut featuring a very similar popping type of candy on the very top of this one here along with that white icing and of course you've got the standard yeast donut as you guys can see it's pretty much just in star form but I have to admit it does smell very sweet and where I think the comet candy version had a cotton candy type of topping this supposedly has something that is blue raspberry flavored but as you guys can see the colors are on display looks like we've got the blue the purple a little bit of yellow definitely colorful and definitely very sweet-smelling so yeah I guess this pretty much is the natural progression on what they can do to bring back something very similar to last year and still keep the cosmic theme which incidentally you can actually pair this up with one of the new cosmic coolattas right now and really go into sugar overload there's actually three of them that you can choose from which is pretty cool but I think I'll just stick with the donut because I'm very curious about this one specifically so let's give this a go guys it's the all new shooting star donut here at Dunkin and is this one gonna be popping like crazy we're about to find out mmm well honestly I'm not getting a single pop with this one with the exception of the crunch which almost feels like I have little rice krispies bits on the very top of this it is very very sweet but pretty much guys this tastes like the peeps donut believe it or not that I reviewed a while back I'll make sure to link that in the upper right hand corner every display you can check that review out when I did that one but I have to admit again very sweet very fluffy on the yeast donut but I'm not getting any real popping sensation but hey I love the way it looks and it's pretty cool now honestly this really is reminding me of that comet candy donut from last year but on the real there is definitely a blueberry type flavor with this one this is not tasting like cotton candy whatsoever it's got more of a fruity type of feel to it and I really dig it I mean it is noticeable even though it's not popping at all and like I said the topping is very reminiscent of like rice krispies to me just a little bit there but it's fun to eat and the icing is nice on it guys but again very very sweet to go with this yeast donut which looks really thick actually right there pretty decent i guess the cool thing about this one is the fact that you pretty much have like five different points with all the goodness that you can bite into here pretty easily instead of like a standard ring type doughnut so I like the shape I think it's very fitting I love the cosmic theme they're going for in terms of a being kind of a shooting star but honestly not too much different from the one from last year with the exception of the blueberry flavor which I'm actually tasting pretty nicely as I'm talking right now it's actually got a very very nice back type of flavor to it it's not bad and hey I guess it does help that it is super fresh right now as well considering I'm doing this at night normally you think donuts by the end of the day are not gonna be that great this is actually still pretty super fluffy and again the flavor is definitely reminiscent of what I usually get here at dunkin from these yeast type of donuts guys it's got a very nice thickness to it and again the flavor is on point not bad so no real popping for me this time out but I do like the fact that the flavor is on point the sweetness is there it's not too sweet it's not too bland and I have to admit the flavor is pretty decent right in the middle actually and again it is very fluffy for the donut itself so I am really digging that on top of it there so it's hearty when I'm biting into this right now and again I am really digging that white icing solid well the appearance definitely sells this one even if the popping is not quite there this actually has a lot going for it considering the topping amount on it is actually decent and the star shape is pretty looking and hey would be a perfect trifecta if the popping candy was doing its job so with that said I'm gonna have to give the shooting star donut here at Dunkin a pretty decent 8 out of 10 like I said it's the looks in the flavor that's really carrying this one right now aside from the fact that I'm filming is pretty late at night it's actually a very fresh donut still and again that blueberry flavoring is really standing out above and beyond just to differentiate enough from the comet candy donut from last year so if you're looking for a fun shaped sweet treat with just a little bit of that candied blueberry flavor this is definitely something you should check out and of course I think you know what I'm gonna ask you next right are you gonna give this one a shot drop some comments down below let me know how interested you are to give this new shooting star donut a shot over here at dunkin and if you are gonna give it a shot are you basing that on the shape that it is or the supposed popping candy like flavor it's supposed to deliver drop those comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K closing out another episode of peep this out cheaters cam style bringing you brand new content every single week here on my channel so while you stay tuned for that next review coming real soon in the meantime stay frosty well poppin no but just the right amount of sweetness yes alright everyone until next time I'll talk to you soon
