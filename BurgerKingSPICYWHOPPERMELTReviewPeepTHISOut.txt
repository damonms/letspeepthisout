 what's going on everyone and welcome or  welcome back to the channel it's Ian K   where today i'm over at bk for round two of  their all new whopper melts that's right and   this one's looking a little heated too so stay  tuned because the spicy whopper melt is up next   welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty ooh it looks like it's about to go down once again  guys feast your eyes on the spicy whopper melt and   i gotta say there is plenty of that jalapeno aroma  in the air right now along with the stacker sauce   but man this is a beautiful looking little burger  here and i gotta say i can't wait to get into this   one let's break this one down first all right so  starting us off is that familiar toasted bread and   when we pop it you're gonna see we've got a decent  amount of stacker sauce as well as caramelized   onions but panning on down guys we've got plenty  of jalapenos and more of the caramelized onion   goodness right there guys along with a spicy  sauce and that's all on top of two whopper   junior patties two of them a quarter pound of  beef with this one flame grilled goodness and guys   it's looking very gooey and very decadent very  nice in terms of the inviting presentation with   this one and again the aroma is pretty awesome  on this guys so without further ado here we go   it's the spicy whopper melt here at bk let's peep  out this flavor yes sir the jalapeno is really   setting off the tone with this one guys i can  almost tell this is going to be a little bit of   a heated situation but i got to admit again while  it's not an overly large little burger here right   now i mean it is kind of a little burger when you  look at it in my hand it's not so much large as it   is tall and that's what i really like about that  even in the package it looks like it's going to   be pretty inviting because of how thick it is and  that's a good thing because what it may lack in   overall size in your hand it's got it in height so  that's pretty awesome right there so guys without   further ado here we go it's the spicy variant of  the all-new whopper melt here at bk let's peep this out man it's a hearty little sucker ooo   oh yeah right off the break those jalapenos  and that sauce is really kicking in hang on wow that is a nice little dovetail right into the  flame grilled beef on this one as well as all the   cheese guys wow that's a nice steamy situation  a very lovely little hearty burger with this one   guys it like i said it really satisfies because  it's a tall burger it's mostly the bread that   you're seeing there but it's packed full of flavor  guys as you can see a lovely amount of cheese the   caramelized onions but the heat that i'm getting  from the jalapenos and the overall sauce combo   with this one is really delivering a nice amount  of heat guys very nice so far on this but again   and just like my last review on the original  whopper melt which is probably popping up on   your screen here right now definitely take a look  at that one if you haven't checked it out just yet   the bun itself on this one or i should say the  bread is not as toasted as i'd like it to be i   mean naturally it's got that visual representation  that it is toasted but i'm not getting that   initial crunch to kind of like a patty melt style  that i would kind of expect from something like   this it's kind of what this is actually because  of the way that it's set up but at the same time   the jalapenos the stacker sauce the light  sweetness that i'm getting initially up front   a very lovely combination let's go for another  couple in this one guys it's pretty awesome um the jalapenos make this they really but  man it is definitely on the spicier side   and i'm digging that because it is a spicy  whopper melt after all hang on one second man really really tasty so again value-wise what  you're getting is pretty bomb on this guys i mean   it's a quarter pound of beef spread out between  two of the whopper junior patties and like i said   even though it's not an overly large burger it's  definitely tall and it really does satisfy so   it's kind of like a mini large burger at the  same time because it feels substantial even   though it's a little bit small in the hand but  it's got a lot of flavor packed in with this one   and at the same time that combination of the  stacker sauce and of course the jalapenos the   spicy goodness that i'm getting all around is a  lovely situation on top of all the cheesy goodness   in there as well so a nicely done situation on  this one and value-wise not bad for what this is   these are pretty awesome i have to admit for the  first major promo of 2022 over here at bk this   is really something truly different in terms of  the way that it feels the caramelized onions are   a very nice touch with this all right so let's go  for one more bite on this one before we wrap the   review up with the rating coming up next because  i think i've gotten just about everything that   i can out of this it's a nice little upgrade  with the spicy goodness added overall but guys   a very fun burger over here at bk with all that  classic flavor that you would expect with the   flame grilled goodness a very lovely situation  one more bite we'll close the review out hang on well i have a feeling a lot of you guys are really  gonna dig this one over here at bk and honestly   for what you're going to be getting for the money  it's not bad value-wise but my only major gripe   with it is that the bread itself is not as toasty  as i'd like it to be and like i said even though   it doesn't have that initial crunch what i am  getting is more of a patty melt type of vibe   with the double meat aspect of it here a quarter  pound of beef really does fill this one out nicely   and while it's not overly large it's definitely  got the height and those caramelized onions are   a bomb situation along with the jalapenos a very  lovely thing indeed definitely worth checking out   for sure so jumping right to it i'm gonna have  to give the spicy variant of the all-new whopper   melt over here at bk another rock solid 9 out  of 10 guys it's a very nice upgrade over the   original one that i just did and i have to say the  addition of jalapenos on top of everything there   is a beautiful situation that combination with the  caramelized onions the cheese the overall flame   grilled beef flavor it really does satisfy and  like i said when it lacks an overall size because   of how small it feels it more than makes up for it  because it feels very hearty when you dive into it   so guys all those classic flavors of bk for a  fairly decent price point for what you're going   to be getting with that one it is substantial  enough and i think it should satisfy definitely   worth checking out especially if you like spice  all right so i've got one more variation of this   burger coming up very very soon but when it  comes to the spicy variant do me a quick favor   drop some comments down below let me know what  your overall thoughts were of this particular one   and if you've actually had it already what  did you think of the jalapenos in general i   mean did you really love the flavor of those  added to the overall whopper melt themselves   drop those comments down below and definitely  let me know and with that this is Ian K closing   out another high quality foodie feature for you  here on peep this out reviews bringing you brand   new content every single week here on my channel
