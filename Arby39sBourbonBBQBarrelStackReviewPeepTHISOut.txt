 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty it's bourbon barbecue time once again at Arby's and this time they're stacking things a little differently with the big gun promo in the lineup so here we go with the bourbon barbecue barrel stack and already it's a very meaty very crunchy looking situation here some of the classic components of Arby's during the summertime for the barbecue season let's take a look at the star crossed bun on the very top nice and soft let's pop it up and see what we've got underneath it looks like plenty of that barrel aged barbecue sauce there the Bourbon goodness in effect we've got some crispy onions some melted cheddar cheese and that's actually all on top of some marinated brisket the 13-hour goodness that you see there and underneath that let's go a little further on this one looks like we're supposed to have some pit smoked ham which is right there in effect and a crispy chicken patty guys that's actually new for this version compared to the version I did when I did the triple stack about a year or so ago that actually had sliced turkey and angus steak and everything else was pretty much the same here but looking pretty nice pretty crispy underneath that let's go a little further down and looks like more barbecue sauce I can barely peel that up but there's a lot of goodness here guys a lot of crunchy goodness I have to admit I think it's gonna be some more crunch this time around but looking really tasty this is the all new bourbon barbecue barrel stack here at Arby's let's peep out this flavor so are you a fan of high quality delicious looking food reviews well if so definitely hit that subscribe button down below and don't forget to tap that Bell icon so you could be notified as soon as new content drops every week now let's dive into this one well at least for me it looks like the spotlights clearly gonna be on that pit smoked ham and the homestyle chicken patty as this version of the Bourbon barbecue sandwich that I reviewed about a year or so ago that triple stack was pretty amazing I'll make sure to link in the upper right hand corner for display right now naturally that sliced turkey and the angus steak contributed very nicely to the overall brisket and everything else on the sandwich but let's just see how this year's version of it is it's the bourbon barbecue barrel stack here at Arby's very barbecue looking guys very barbecue looking mmm and as always it's very thick the chicken patty along with the very sweet bourbon barbecue sauce instantly stands out guys and a little bit of the ham coming up on the back end there not too much of the brisket just yet but it's got a lot of flavor as you'd expected to have consider the amount of barbecue sauce on this there's actually a lot more as I'm getting into it let's keep going yeah this one's definitely locked and loaded with a fairly thick chicken patty along with that homestyle breading guys and it goes very very nicely with the bourbon barbecue sauce there's a lot of flavor there the candied goodness from that bacon is coming through with that second bite and of course all the other meats although they are there are slightly drowned out because of the flavor of the barbecue sauce and the chicken believe it or not there's just a lot going on here guys but it's very flavorful yeah that candied brown sugar bacon is clearly a highlight Arby's definitely does that well over here and it's really a nice addition to the sandwich in general but just the overall thickness of everything on this one is blowing me away with everything that it's got here guys the sweetness of that BBQ sauce is on point and again everything else is melding so nicely with that chicken patty those are really the dominant flavors for me right now because of the thickness of it and just the sweetness of the barbecue sauce in general let's keep going mmm those little onion Tanglers coming up on the back end also a very nice addition you'd expect it to be little onion pieces on Arby's sandwiches in general you know all these promo sandwiches typically have them it's a nice addition and as usual not really tasting that melted cheese at all again I think it's just keeping everything together as you've heard me say a million times but still very very tasty and everything is just blending very nicely with this even if I can't really taste the cheese all the other flavors are coming through along with the brisket finally I'm finally getting into the flavor of the brisket along with that ham a little bit more as I'm about halfway in right now but guys beautiful situation but you know what I think can make this even more of a beautiful situation horsey sauce let's go for it and we're gonna go for it right there in the middle guys let's load it up very nicely horsey sauce is the jam with all of the meats here at Arby's for the most part let's hit it up oh and have I told you how thankful I am for the sandwich diaper right now there is so much barbecue sauce falling off the back of this this is almost a necessity especially if you're eating in your car like I am right now here we go mmm man always the jam always a jam but I'm actually having one small issue wit at this time out I'm not really a fan of horsey sauce and the chicken patty I don't think that goes very well naturally the saltiness and the flavors of the meats it goes amazingly well but with the chicken patty not so much guys but everything else a beautiful situation I don't think I'm gonna be using that with a chicken in any future review not really a fan but guys delicious stuff still really good so let's close this one out with another close-up shot of all the goodness that Arby's does extremely well and with a name like stack in the title of this one you'd expect it to be a lot of meat and there definitely is as you can see from top to bottom guys it's got a lot going on here plenty of barbecue sauce to go with and a very nice blend of meats this time out with the wild card being that chicken patty on the bottom which is definitely different from the turkey last time out and the angus steak being replaced with that pit smoked ham but everything else very very nicely done on this one and again lots to look forward to if you're a carnivore definitely give this one a shot well this was one thick and meaty sandwich and with the addition of that homestyle chicken patty swapping out for the turkey from last time out along with the angus steak being switched with the ham guys a really nice combination of flavors and that was only enhanced by the fan favorite bourbon barbecue sauce that they use over here at Arby's along with the candied brown sugar bacon that combination alone with everything guys really made this one for me and while it was the chicken patty with that homestyle breading along with the barbecue sauce that kind of took center stage at least for me on top of the brown sugar bacon everything else still worked very very nicely and it was very satisfying and very hearty to eat I just personally wouldn't recommend horsey sauce with this particular one but again that's just my personal preference I didn't think it went very well with the chicken but hey guys everything else was still very very tasty as you've heard me say so with that said I'm gonna have to give the bourbon barbecue barrel stack here at Arby's a pretty decent 8.3 out of 10 everything for the most part worked on this pretty nicely with the exception of some of the flavors being just a little muted everything else still blended together to give you that flavor that you'd expect to have during the summertime especially here at Arby's pretty decent but of course the obvious question is did this look pretty decent to you drop some comments down below how enticed are you to give this bourbon barbecue barrel stack a shot over here at Arby's much less some of the other versions they've got now since you've got a brisket version and a turkey version also available drop those comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian closing out another episode of peep this out bringing you brand
