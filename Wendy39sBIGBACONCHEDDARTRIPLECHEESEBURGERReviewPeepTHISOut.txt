 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty what's going on everyone and welcome back  to another high quality foodie feature for   you here on the channel where this time  i'm hitting up wendy's to go in in their   latest promo which looks absolutely stacked  with plenty of big bacon cheddar goodness   and you better believe i'm going big on it too  guys feast your eyes on their all new big bacon   cheddar triple cheeseburger definitely a tower of  power guys we have a lovely situation in front of   us here right now super tall lots of beef lots  of goodies here looking pretty fantastic let's   start off with that cheddar bun which is looking  pretty awesome and underneath it guys we have   a laundry list of goodies here i'm just going to  read it off to you we've got some bacon jam crispy   onions a cheddar dip applewood smoked bacon three  fresh never frozen beef patties three quarters   of a pound of goodness here guys that's looking  pretty fantastic and of course plenty of american   cheese but guys again the height on this is pretty  ridiculous there is lots of cheese lots of bacon   crispy onions everything about this is just  screaming gluttonous it's really really nice guys   it looks really awesome so let's just get into it  even if it's just halfway decent it's still going   to be pretty awesome guys this is the all new big  bacon cheddar triple cheeseburger here at wendy's   let's peep out this flavor yup this is almost  stupid ridiculous guys plenty of beef plenty of   cheese plenty of bacon crispy onions bacon jam a  cheddar dip you name it this thing has got it it   really looks pretty awesome guys and again the  cheddar bun on the very top a lovely situation   how i'm gonna wrap my mouth around this i don't  know i've done plenty of triple burgers here at   wendy's in the past let's just give it a go guys  i'm very excited to do this for you right now   this is the all-new big bacon cheddar triple  cheeseburger here at wendy's crazy let's do it whoa beef and cheese whoa overload all right  now if you're wondering why i actually chose   to do the triple version of this burger guys  with this amount of bacon this amount of cheese   and the various types of jams and of course  the cheese dips and all the cheese in general   you gotta have a lot of beef because i figured  it would be an overload of the toppings   but when you add a whole multitude of beef to  go with it i gotta admit it matches up pretty   beautifully right now there's not one thing  that's overpowering the other and believe it   or not that beef is really holding its own with  the cheddar dip that bacon jam everything about   this is really pretty gluttonous guys pretty  insane indeed let's go for a couple more bites   in this that's all i can pretty much do i  can already feel it guys really good hang on wow i had to get into it enough to give you  another cross shot here because naturally all the   goodness that you can see on the outside has to  be matched up with all the crazy goodness you're   seeing on the inside guys plenty of applewood  smoked bacon on this i gotta say it is a pretty   banging situation a lovely situation in general  and guys everything else is singing with this   all those flavors are coming through but the  beefiness on top of it that fresh beef is a crazy   situation believe it or not i'm not really tasting  the cheddar bun yet maybe because of the way the   top is on this one here but honestly i really  don't care because this is crazy gluttonous with   everything else that it's got the crispy onions  crazy situation yeah i knew this thing was going   to be insane when i saw it online and naturally  guys with all the beef that wendy's does amazingly   well over here all these toppings go so crazy  good with it and honestly there's so much cheese   with everything that this has got i mean the bacon  jam in general you get a little bit of sweetness   that's in there as well but guys the hickory  smoked goodness the beefiness all the other   flavors with this on top of the crispy onions  just a banging situation let me try and at least   go for a couple more bites on this one but guys  it is crazy good even in triple form guys again   nuts absolutely nuts right here three quarters  of a pound before cooking i'm sure it didn't   lose too much in the process but even still it's a  mother of a burger it's crazy let's keep going in mmm man that is so good all right let's be  real you already know the applewood smoked   bacon here at wendy's is the jam i mean naturally  it goes well with the bacon jam but it's the jam   in general because the crispiness the smokiness  the hickory goodness that it's got is on point   and again it combines beautifully with all  the classic flavors of the beef over here   when you combine that with the cheddar dip i  gotta say guys it's very nice but again super   gluttonous all the extra cheese that's separating  the patties right there an absolute ridiculous   situation super super delicious on this and again  this is really more of a show piece for me i'm not   really getting into the bun too much here let  me try and pull a little piece off real quick i mean it's good it's definitely got some nice  flavor but honestly with everything else that   this has got believe it or not that's actually  the weakest link on this right now because all   the other flavors of this burger are killing that  flavor but still it's soft it's nice and chewy   i'm definitely digging it all right so  let's go for one more bite of this guys   because believe it or not this is already  leveling me out big time and obviously with   everything that you're seeing here right now  how could it not i'm just gonna keep showing   it to you there's plenty of money shots  throughout this review for you right there   a delicious situation indeed and i'm really  digging that cheddar dip believe it or not as well   along with the bacon jam it's very pronounced  and it goes amazing with the beef as well as the   applewood smoked bacon when we're buying we'll  close this one out guys but super gluttonous   and absolutely worth your time at  least once just my opinion hang on well this is definitely one of the kings of fast  food burgers for sure guys because there's not a   lot of places really offer a triple on the menu  like this at least regularly you can probably   have it made for you but even still when it's  official like this a lovely situation as we go   around the world you're going to see lots of  cheesy goodness around the back there that i'm   just making this little fly by here for you  right now but even still a lovely situation   plenty of goodness to enjoy on this one and again  crispy onions everything that you'd want to have   in a cheeseburger naturally with plenty of bacon  lots of goodness on this one this one's got a lot   of character definitely digging it man i am so  done right now especially after those few bites   guys it's very gluttonous very tasty and i gotta  say guys the epitome of what a fast food burger   should be like because it's so cheesy so meaty  so beefy everything about that with the bacon   just a lovely situation all around so as if you  really need me to confirm it for you right now i'm   gonna have to give the all-new big bacon cheddar  triple cheeseburger here at wendy's a rock solid   10 out of 10 guys this is already winning right  off the gate because of the bacon and the amount   of cheese in general so all the other toppings  that they're adding to that is just the icing on   the cake and naturally they all work the cheddar  dip the bacon jam definitely the onions the crispy   onions on that is on top of it and even though i'm  not really tasting so much of the bun considering   the bites that i was taking it's a little uneven  with the amount of cheese on top at least mine was   everything else on that really sang in  the flavor department and how could it not   three quarters of a pound of beef are  you kidding me with cheese with bacon   absolutely insane and like i said worth trying at  least one time guys the triple burgers at wendy's   are pretty banging all right so you've made it  this far into the review i'd venture to guess   you're definitely down with this burger right now  especially the triple variant are you going to be   giving this one a shot drop some comments down  below and confirm it for me let me know what you   thought of this in general and what did you think  of the amount of toppings do you think it's maybe   too much for this burger was one more overpowering  the other compared to what you may be used to   drop those comments down below and definitely  let me know and
