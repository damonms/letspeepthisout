 hey everyone and welcome or welcome back to the  channel it's Ian K where today i'm over at carl's   jr once again this time to go beyond with another  one of their all-new primal hunger menu items   that's right so stay tuned because  the beyond wraptor burger is up next   welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty well i gotta say the greenery is on point with  this one already guys this is looking pretty crazy   feast your eyes on the beyond wraptor burger here  at carl's jr a lot of luscious greenery of course   with a lot of tasty goodness in the  middle let's break this one down real fast   yup i definitely feel like i'm in the jungle  with this one guys take a look at the size of   the leaf lettuce on this one this is definitely  looking like a banging situation already and once   we lift a few of these pieces up you're  gonna see all that goodness right there   starting off with fried zucchini action we've  got four pieces on top that's actually held   together with a piece of swiss cheese and  underneath it we've got a couple of beyond   meat patties plant-based goodness non-gmo mostly  from pea protein and a few other things but guys   definitely an awesome situation you gotta love  that beyond meat goodness over here at carl's jr   we've got another slice of swiss cheese actually  under that as well but guys it's all about the   leaf lettuce with this one it's an awesome  showpiece for sure and a really nice play on   the raptor name but guys in addition to all that  we've got amber barbecue sauce which is basically   a carolina barbecue sauce on the top to bottom  as well with this one along with a couple of   slices of tomato but guys again the way that  this is encased in so much lettuce right now   is very very cool and with the double action  that you've got here right now with beyond meat this   is looking pretty banging all right so let's not  waste any more time on this one i have a feeling   this is going to be a little tough to eat but  let's just get into it guys this is the all-new   beyond raptor burger here at carl's jr celebrating  the release of jurassic world dominion let's peep   out this flavor yeah this has to be one of the  craziest wraps i have ever had over here at carl's   jr yet guys and i have to say this is looking  really really great it's so crazy i actually   have to have a bunch of napkins in addition to  the regular diaper this comes with because there   is a lot of that amber barbecue sauce falling  out the back of this right now and again a very   challenging situation i think just to bite into  this so let me try and fold this just a little bit   and make sure i don't get any of the paper in here  here we go guys man there's so much greenery on   this here we go it's the beyond wraptor burger here  at carl's jr let's peep this out man here we go a lot of greenery well right off the break i  got none of the zucchini pieces in that first bite   guys but i did get a nice bite of both patties  of the beyond meat and as you're gonna see here   it is a very lovely situation of plant-based  goodness it's not quite a flavor of a burger   necessarily but it's got the mouth feel and  obviously the feel of everything else in this   here right now is very pleasurable so far and you  got to have that swiss cheese on there to hold   things together because things are beginning to  slip and slide with this one plenty of that amber   barbecue sauce guys a very lovely situation but i  really want to dovetail right into that zucchini   right now so let me make sure i get actually one  of those ready to go and we'll give this a shot   but guys the greenery is off the chart with this  one right now here we go let's keep going in on it here we go i gotta say my favorite thing about  this right now is the zucchinis mixed in with that   amber barbecue sauce guys that carolina goodness  is mixing so beautifully with the right amount   of sweetness and then you're getting the nice  fried goodness of the zucchini and then naturally   the zucchini itself mixing it with the beyond  meat is a very very lovely situation but again   very very messy at the same time it's super fun  to eat but a challenge to eat at the same time   as well and like i mentioned earlier i'm really  digging the play on the name wraptor with this one   and chances are you're going to see a few raptors  making an appearance in this review right now   i gotta tell you i think it's appropriate  right considering jurassic world dominion   but this is really really tasty guys and  again there is just so much greenery with this   you guys gotta make sure you've got a lot of  napkins on hand because everything is very   awesome on this in terms of the flavor i mean  you've got plenty of the cheese it's nice and   gooey right there in the middle which i really  dig and there is plenty of amber barbecue sauce   to speak of as well let's go for another  couple on this one guys it is pretty tasty and zucchini is banging with this   yeah the flavor of that beyond meat is amazing  on this and considering you can go for a single   as well as the double possibly the single may  be the way to go because everything is really   slipping and sliding even with that cheese it is  very very slippery as i'm talking right now if you   do order this and naturally i'd recommend that you  do because if you like beyond meat i think you're   going to dig this definitely get to it right away  because everything begins to gel together with the   sauce with the cheese and it gets to be a little  on the messy side scratch that very messy side   actually guys this is really really hard to eat  right now but a lot of fun at the same time and   again as a promo item for jurassic world dominion  it's a lot of fun with a fun play on the raptor   name considering this is basically a lettuce wrap  so to speak very very cool with this one all right   so let's go for one more bite in this one as  everything begins to disintegrate around it and   then we'll close the review up with the rating  coming up next but guys again another fun promo   item over here carl's jr celebrating jurassic  world dominion on the primal hunger menu a   banging situation for a lettuce wrap just a messy  one one more bite and we'll close this out hang up well you've got lots of tasty beyond me goodness  to enjoy with this one guys especially in double   form like this it really goes pretty nicely with  everything on the inside of this especially with   the zucchini and that amber barbecue sauce again  a beautiful situation with that sauce anything   you put that on lights up everything beautifully a  very nice combination of goodness surrounded by a   ton of greenery again just make sure you've  got plenty of napkins on hand just saying   well i gotta say that was a bit of a challenge  to review here in the car guys but i was more   than up for the task because i definitely wanted  to check this one out and it was super fun to do   naturally so with everything you've seen and  heard up to this point i'm gonna have to give   the all-new beyond wraptor burger here at carl's  jr celebrating of course the release of jurassic   world dominion a pretty decent 8.3 out of 10  guys beautiful beyond me goodness with that one   and i got to say the flavor overall delivered  across the board the zucchinis go amazing with   that amber barbecue sauce it's just a very very  messy burger in general and again you got to make   sure you've got plenty of napkins on hand but  even still if you're not down with the primal   primal angus thickburger which you should be and if  you haven't seen my look at that one take a look   at it popping up on your screen here right now  this is a great alternative in general because   i do love beyond meat and they do it very well  over here at carl's jr and the quality overall   was a beautiful situation on that definitely give  this one a go just be prepared for sticker shock   because this one is over $12 as a double hey it  is what it is all right real quick outside of   the usual are you going to be giving this one  a shot drop some comments down below and let me   know if you think this is actually worth over $12  as a double i mean would you actually spend that   much on a burger like this and even if you're  a fan of beyond meat do you still think this   one is worth it drop some comments down below and  definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K   closing out another high quality foodie feature  for you here on peep this out reviews bringing   you brand new content every single week here on  my channel so while you stay tuned for that next review   coming real soon in the
