let's peep this out well we're after-hours with the Masters of meat craft going in on their all-new King's Hawaiian half pound club and in true Arby's fashion we have got a beast of a sandwich here that is just a lot of meat I wasn't expecting anything less and I'm definitely not disappointed so far starting off with the awesome King's Hawaiian bun definitely nice and soft let's take a look underneath it looks like a fairly generous amount of that creamy Dijon and hanging out in the back here is that brown sugar bacon action guys I can't wait to get into that that candied bacon is awesome we've got some Swiss cheese slow roasted turkey we've got some Pit smoked ham and it just keeps going on down here let's see if we can lift this up further nice and lean guys all white meat looking pretty fantastic and we have got looks like a tomato slice down there and some lettuce and a my guess is probably more of that creamy Dijon yes there is more to top it off right there but man that is just awesome it smells fantastic there is plenty of food here for sure for the money let's see if the flavor is gonna deliver on this one it's the King's Hawaiian half pound club with the return of brown sugar bacon and King's Hawaiian together here at Arby's let's peep out this flavor yeah 9 times out of 10 you are pretty much guaranteed that no matter what promo Arby's comes out with you're gonna have what I like to call a behemoth variant available alongside whatever it is and guys in this case it's virtually everything but the kitchen sink with a very nice selection of meat and guys brown sugar bacon and King's Hawaiian that combo is gonna be insane I just know it so before take a bite of this behemoth and like always if you guys are fans of high-quality delicious looking

burger diaper in this case the sandwich diaper in the bottom of this one there's so much meat there's so much juice this is pretty much soaked in the very back here we go it's the King's Hawaiian half pound club let's do this man this looks insane and it is oh man candied brown sugar bacon action along with a very creamy Dijon sauce a little bit of sweetness all on its own the softness of the King's Hawaiian bun and then immediately into the flavors of the meats guys that ham is insane the turkey is lean it's very juicy the crunch with the lettuce everything with this so far right now this is definitely a packed sandwich let's go for another bite this is definitely banging guys really really awesome stuff already here we go a lot of meat that sandwich diaper is disintegrating right behind me here right now guys this thing is so juicy it's so wet but as you can see it is so packed with the good stuff I am absolutely loving this it's a carnivores dream and there is a ton of Turkey on here guys I am really loving how that is that that is just fantastic as you guys can see that smoked ham and of course the bacon on the very top all the candied goodness it's a lot of protein and man a definite appetite destroyer just look at the thickness of that a half pound indeed I'm having trouble holding this with one hand and a light in the other right now this is pretty insane let's keep going with it it's awesome and hey real quick just in case the half pound variant is not to your liking which I don't know why it wouldn't be considering how much fun it is to dive into all this meat right now you've got three other options available including roast beef BLT and Turkey separately and of course it has all that brown sugar bacon the King's Hawaiian bun but guys this is really the way to go because it really is a little bit of everything together and let me just say it is super fun to eat like this let's go for one more bite and you better believe we're going for a little horsey sauce action right after hang on because I really want to keep going with it right it's delicious man it's so tasty that creamy Dijon has a little bit of a mustard flare to it so I'm really diggin the overall quality of what that's adding to everything else it doesn't overpower the flavors of the other meats on this one and the fact that they're choosing pretty lean meats in general you can really taste everything all the layers are there but that candied bacon action is amazing with the king hawaiian just overall a delicious sandwich but a messy one because I can feel it running down my hand right now guys it is no joke so let's go for a little bit of that horsey sauce action and confirm the awesomeness for you all right I had a double bag the back of this one here so let's get some horsey on this and get it laced up ready to go this is already looking fantastic guys let's do this and all the horsey is right in the middle there and the thickest part of the sandwich with all the meat layers here we go never bad never bad mmm that sharp horseradish bite along with all the other flavors of the meats combined together with the sweetness of the candied bacon as well as the King's Hawaiian sign me up guys horsey elevates any sandwich here at Arby's to new levels and the good thing is it's a complement to all the flavors on the sandwich to begin with so you don't have to rely on horsey because the individual flavors of the sandwich already speak for themselves it's very high quality meats here guys and I have to say the flavors stand out anyway but when you add that horsey sauce that flavor enhancement is taken into overload and it's just a delicious combination great stuff all around let's go for one more bite I'll give you one final close-up before we wrap this one after the rating but guys my mouth is watering this is falling apart right now but I'm having a blast doing this right now cheater cam style just for you guys here we go again hmm all right so no 360 with this one because the whole thing is about to fall apart as I'm looking at this here guys but as you can see it is a ton of meat it's everything that Arby's does extremely well an amazing combination of meats and just an amazing combination of flavors that are only taken to the next level with that horsey sauce with this the brown sugar bacon is awesome with the King's Hawaiian bread and the additional light sweetness of that creamy Dijon really caps off what's already an amazing tasting sandwich to begin with guys so an easy recommendation and obviously the version I'd recommend to you this is really awesome but please make sure you've got plenty of napkins on hand trust me this thing is very very wet but it's also a testament to the quality of the meats that they're using and how fresh it is so very very tasty overall okay is if you really need me to confirm it for you I'm gonna have to give the King's Hawaiian half pound club here at Arby's a rock-solid 10 out of 10 and I know you probably saw that one coming a mile away because guys look at what it is there is no way you can go wrong with something like this there was just so much meat add in the horsey sauce factor to this and you already have another level of flavor right there to look forward to and that's in addition to the awesome light sweetness of that creamy Dijon that really is the wild-card in this one on top of the candy brown sugar bacon as well as the King's Hawaiian bun just a solid situation all around and one like I said I would wholeheartedly recommend to you go with that version I'm telling you you're gonna like this now of course the obvious question is are you gonna go with this version drop some comments down below are you super excited to give the brown sugar bacon a shout with the Kings Hawaiian bun over here at Arby's and what do you think of a selection of meats on it I mean I have kind of goodness that I just reviewed I'm telling you I would easily rock that one again but would you give it a shot got some comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K closing out another episode of peep this out cheaters cam style
