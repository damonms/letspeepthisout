 hey everyone welcome back to another high quality  foodie feature for you here on the channel where   this time i'm headed into little caesars to check  out a little sweet treat they've got going on   that's right so stay tuned because the cookie  dough brownie with m&m's minis is up next   welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty all right so here we go with the all-new cookie  dough brownie with m&m's minis and right off the   bat guys you're gonna notice this thing is super  colorful and super long i'm definitely digging   the presentation and there is no shortage  of those chocolate candies on the top the m&m's   look pretty awesome alright so what this is  very simply is a very long chocolate brownie   topped off with cookie dough flavored frosting  and then garnished with a whole bunch of m&m's minis   chocolate candies and again guys the presentation  is pretty killer super long on this one super   colorful and the thickness is not bad either  on those brownies it's cut into four pieces as   you can see and again very very nice in the  presentation department very cool actually   and it's very hefty as well this has definitely  got some weight to it and considering there's only   four pieces in here it looks very very  dense aside from being super colorful   so let me rip off one of these four pieces  here wow this is very very gooey already   take a look at that very nice on the top  this one actually has a whole ton of the m&m's   pieces you can see the thickness right there  that cookie dough as well no shortage of that   frosting let's give this a shot it's the all-new  cookie dough brownie with m&m's minis let's do it oh crazy sweet wow that is almost sickly sweet  but the flavor is right in your face the frosting   definitely cookie dough goodness lots of chocolate  because of the minis oh yeah it's pretty good all   right well after that first bite you can easily  see the amount of frosting in terms of the level   a little bit easier there guys considering you can  kind of see it right over here at the end but then   after that bite is in there there is no shortage  of that cookie dough frosting i am really digging   that and the m&m's minis are super plentiful on this  they taste exactly like you'd expect m&m's but it   is so dense and so rich and so thick that i think  one piece is all you really need with this well   maybe not only one piece but something to drink  because guys like i said it is very sickly sweet   you're gonna get thirsty instantly hang on wow  it's not helping that i'm actually filming this   in super hot weather as well continuing on  with summer here in southern cali but again   let's go for another bite of this another  close-up for you there really digging the   quality it really tastes very dense very  rich but very tasty let's keep going in the cookie dough is the banging  highlight with this it really is   it's got a very rich smooth granular type of  texture that really stands out in the cookie dough   flavor and that's really the spot on thing with  this on top of just the overall product in general   but guys the fact that cookie dough is actually  safe to eat many years ago it wasn't this tastes   exactly like you'd expect it to it's almost like  a chocolate chip flavored cookie dough but raw   on top of a very nice chocolatey type of brownie  and then topped off with the m&m's minis very simple   but at the same time all the flavors are singing  pretty banging an fyi even though you can pretty   much only pick this up at the counter when you go  into little caesars i actually asked the gentleman   behind the counter if i can just get it through  the pizza portal because it's so much fun to pick   up food that way so thankfully he obliged to do  just that and you're probably seeing that footage   up on your screen here right now lots of good  times with this but naturally this is cold and   it needs to be because naturally as it's getting  warmer it's beginning to kind of melt all into my   hands here right now so keep in mind you're not  going to get it to the pizza portal when you pick   this one up i just wanted to show you that for fun  get it up at the counter get it nice and cold as   it's meant to be and you're definitely going to  enjoy it one more bite we'll finish this one out all right let me finish this one off with  a shot of the other three pieces here and   as you can see guys no shortage of that color  as i'm saying throughout this review it looks   really really awesome and it's really cool to have  the name brand m&m's on the top of this one here   the quality of the brownie is very dense  very rich very thick and again with the   sweetness level on this one have a drink handy  you're gonna need it it's ultra crazy in that   sugar department you're definitely going to  want to have something to wash it down with   pizza pizza so with that said i'm going to have  to give the all new cookie dough brownie with   m&m's minis here at little caesars a pretty  decent 7.5 out of 10 i'm not going to go much   higher than that because guys like i said all  throughout this review it is sickly sweet and   even though the flavor is pretty awesome you're  instantly going to want to drink something after   one bite of that it is really tasty nonetheless  but even still aside from the presentation be   prepared it is sugar on overload but you'd expect  it to be right i mean you've got m&m's you've got   frosting flavored like cookie dough and of course  a very rich dense brownie you know it's going to   be sweet still pretty delicious though all right  so i've got one simple question for you because   i venture to guess if you've made it this far  into the review you either A) love cookie dough   B) love brownies or C) you love m&m's or hey D)  maybe you love all of the above do me a quick   favor drop some comments down below are you going  to be giving this one a shot definitely drop those   comments down there and let me know what's up  and with that this is Ian K closing out another   high quality foodie feature for you here on peep  this out reviews bringing you brand new content   every single week here on my channel so while   you stay  tuned for that next review coming real soon in the   meantime stay frosty oh yes it's so cool to see an  actual dessert on the little caesars menu that's   not just a variation of something they do anyway  in store nothing against the loaded cinnamon   bites or anything of the like that they've done  in the past but it's so cool to see an official   item with a licensed candy on the top let's hope  we see more of something like this in the future   alright everyone until next time i'll talk to you  soon hey thanks for
