 what's going on everyone and welcome back  to another high quality foodie feature for   you here on the channel where this time i'm  over at taco bell for a little early access   look at their latest upcoming promo that's  right it's their cantina crispy melt taco   so stay tuned because it's up next welcome to  peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty so here it is the cantina crispy melt taco here  at taco bell and already this is feeling like   an upscale version of their taco supreme that's  not a bad thing guys this is definitely feeling   pretty nice in the hand so this is being billed as  something cheesy as well as crispy i'm definitely   digging a little sleeve this comes in but overall  the presentation looks like it's pretty much   standard fare over here at taco bell what this  is is a fried white corn shell and on the inside   we've got a three cheese blend melted nacho cheese  sauce seasoned beef reduced fat sour cream lettuce   and diced tomatoes and a little bit of shredded  cheese on the very top there that cheddar action   is looking pretty nice to garnish it but guys  looking pretty tasty and again it looks very   similar to what you've pretty much had over here  at taco bell just with a different type of shell   so let's get into it this is the cantina crispy  melt taco here at taco bell let's peep out this   flavor yes sir cheesy and crispy it definitely  looks the part with this goodness right here guys   this is looking really really nice and as you can  see that crispy shell is absolutely on point again   it's an oversized version of their taco supreme  that's the impression that i'm getting with this   one here but naturally with more of a cantina  vibe something you get in a restaurant but even   still i am digging all the goodness on the inside  of this again it's a standard taco bell goodness   but still looks really really nice so without  further ado let's just confirm the goodness   for you right now this is the all new cantina  crispy melt taco here to talk about let's do it first off it was a nice blast of sour  cream and that nacho cheese sauce along   with the seasoned beef but again just like  the standard flavors that you know at taco   bell but with the addition of an extra crispy  type of shell this really is a standout with   this one guys it doesn't feel like this normal  shell that they serve here but it's got more   of a restaurant vibe which is a good thing and  the crispiness is on point let's keep going in well looks like i'm gonna have to put this one  back in the sleeve after that last bite guys   i lost a little bit off the top with this one but  even still i am totally digging the quality of   this one here i really like the crispiness of that  outer shell the fried goodness is really standing   out beautifully and it goes amazing naturally  with the fried goodness and the cheese together so   naturally when you pair that up with the seasoned  beef the sour cream the other lettuce the cheese   everything else in here this is really  beginning to sing definitely digging it   but a word to the wise make use of this little  paper sleeve that it comes with guys because   i'm telling you right now you're going to lose a  whole bunch of stuff off the back which i can't   wait to see this when i play this back actually to  see how much fell off but even still they really   need to have something like this nacho with all  the toppings and everything on it you want to   make sure you're protected somewhat all right so  we're going to go for another couple of bites on   this one but i got to tell you as i'm getting  further into this this is kind of reminding me   of the midnight melt taco that i actually reviewed  a couple of years ago when it was in test market   in irvine california very similar because that was  like a blue type of corn naturally with this being   a white corn i can honestly see the appeal why it's  similar but i really would have wished around   halloween time they actually had that because it  was pretty striking colors as you probably saw   in the thumbnail that popped up on the screen  this is actually a very nice alternative but   it's very similar in flavor considering  the shell but let's keep going in pretty good so much stuff yeah you can't fade that  combination of the nacho cheese sauce along with   the sour cream and the seasoned beef on the inside  of this one guys it's so unmistakably taco bell   and it's just a lovely situation so the big  draw with this one naturally is the oversized   of the actual tortilla itself on the outside  here the corn shell is actually pretty nice   but the crunchiness and the fact that you're  getting like a restaurant vibe i can honestly   see myself having like a couple of these pretty  much on a plate with black beans and rice and   maybe a little melted cheese on top of that this  really does feel like it can be like a restaurant   type of situation like two of these in a combo or  something like that but again just to kind of keep   showing it for you it really is the standard taco  bell goodness but the main standout is definitely   gonna be the shell so nice quality with this  one and like i said the fried goodness goes   amazing with everything on the inside as you'd  expect it to because guys it's taco bell the   flavors are familiar you're just adding a new  type of shell and i dig it because it's good   all right so let's go for one more bite in  this one because this really is pretty much   just like a kicked up taco supreme as far  as i'm concerned but with a very nice fried   white corn tortilla type shell on the outside  but even still very delicious one more bite all right here's the back of it here and this  is why you want to make sure you're eating it   in the sleeve because as you're pressing down on  this one there it's all going to kind of come out   the back there so be very careful but again a  very nice fried white corn shell on this one   and i gotta say again guys the quality of all the  goodness on the inside you're gonna really feel   like it's the same thing that you know but at  the same time very nice considering the clothes   that it's dressed up in tasty stuff order ahead  and pick yours up at our contactless drive-thru   well another halloween is coming up and still we  have not seen the midnight melt taco here at taco   ball just yet like i said a couple of years ago  it was super fun to check out i was really hoping   that would be the thing this year but even still  what you're getting right there like i said is a   very nice combination of goodness from taco bell  that you already know cantina style because of the   fried tortilla shell on the outside i'm definitely  digging that guys it actually really highlights it   but again it's a kicked up taco supreme as far as  i'm concerned but maybe a little extra cheese but   there's nothing wrong with that either because  it's unmistakably taco bell still pretty tasty   so with that said i'm going to have to give the  cantina crispy melt taco here at taco bell just   an okay 7.5 out of 10 and again guys  like i said it really is a kicked up taco supreme   but with a little bit of extra shell goodness  and again the fried goodness is really what makes   this one on top of the familiar flavors that you  already know but like i said still delicious stuff   but very familiar all right so i'd venture to  guess that you're pretty interested in this   particular promo that's coming up over here at  taco bell for october so do me a quick favor   drop some comments down below how excited are  you to give this cantina version of their taco   supreme as far as i'm concerned a shot over here  are you expecting something truly different in   terms of the experience because for me aside from  the familiar flavors it really just feels like the   shell is the main thing on top of this one drop  those comments down below and definitely let   me know and with that this is Ian K closing out  another high quality foodie feature for you here   on peep this out reviews bringing you brand new  content
