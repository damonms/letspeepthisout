 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty all right guys let's get it it's Ian K back again with another high quality foodie feature for you here on peep this out reviews this time returning to dominos because after checking out their chicken taco pizza on taco tuesday recently i definitely had to swing them back to check out the other specialty they had on the menu and i'm excited for this one guys it's their cheeseburger pizza very glorious presentation indeed starting off with the obvious we've got ground beef american cheese cheddar cheese shredded provolone cheese diced tomatoes and onions and that's all on top of a ketchup and mustard sauce which is on top of a hand tossed crust a 14 inch large i've got here right now a promo for $11.99 and i gotta say it's looking really really tasty so let's not waste any more time on this one let's get into it right away it's the cheeseburger pizza brand new here at domino's let's peep out this flavor yeah this is definitely a glorious side indeed guys and i gotta say i'm really digging the amount of onions on this on top of the vibrancy of that ketchup mustard aroma in my car right now you can really smell that pretty intensely when you flip the top on this one and i gotta say it looks really really fantastic presentation is pretty killer okay so before i pull up one of these slices to get into this and

action this is looking really really nice take a look at all that goodness on there very vibrant in that aroma guys like i'm telling you right now it really smells fantastic let's give this a go it's the cheeseburger pizza the all-new specialty here at domino's oh yes this pie is going to get destroyed i already know it not only is the beef jumping out on this but so is the awesomeness of that provolone cheese i mean granted the american cheese is there the cheddar cheese is there as well but the provolone is really sticking out i really dug the philly cheesesteak pizza that i did over here a while back take a look at that review popping up on your screen here right now this is very similar to that because of the consistency of the cheese it's very thick but i'm telling you that ketchup mustard sauce along with the onions and especially along with that beef is a lovely situation take a look at that it is a really glorious presentation in terms of the toppings and that hand tossed crust is nice a little brushed olive oil garlic goodness in the very back there lovely situation guys let's keep going man this tastes like a cheeseburger the beef is very strong along with that cheese it's really good i'm just going to try and give you as many glorious close-ups as i can of this because i am so digging this right now a little onion add-on is amazing with this the flavor is just jumping off like crazy and again the vibrancy of that sauce i keep saying vibrant because it's so strong and pungent along with the cheese the pasty flavorful gooeyness of it is just jumping out all across the board with this one guys and like i said the combination with that beef is really really off the chart just a lovely situation and hey with me not really being a fan of tomatoes i'm not really digging the fact that they're on here right now i mean for accent it's really awesome but i have to admit what this thing is missing and believe it or not i'm surprised it doesn't have it because i think it would be perfect is pickles a little bit of that pickle the acidity the snap and just the overall flavor that it would add would be pretty awesome and considering in the past i've actually reviewed a double cheeseburger pizza as well as a bacon cheeseburger pizza from papa john's i'm really surprised that this doesn't have pickles on it guys because honestly you think cheeseburger you think it's going to have some pickles lettuce that type of thing naturally no lettuce on this but with pickles that just adds another layer of flavor overall but don't get me wrong this is still rock solid for what it is and it's super delicious let's keep going you know with that ketchup mustard combination along with all the cheese on this it actually feels almost like a cheese sauce a little bit more thousand island-like but it's very similar to what you'd expect to have on something like this and i have to admit that combination works extremely well so guys i really can't say it enough this is highly worth your time especially on promo for $11.99 for a large a 14 inch is nothing to sneeze at this is pretty awesome the crust itself nice hand tossed goodness you do have an option for brooklyn style as well as thin but i am totally digging this right now and i'm glad that there's onions on this too to add just a little bit extra but just a beautiful combination and an easy recommendation this one's going to be around for a bit i hope and i'm definitely going to be getting it if it is yeah this is a pretty rock solid addition to the menu right now guys in addition to that pretty tasty chicken taco pizza as well so overall i'm going to have to give this all new cheeseburger pizza here domino's an awesome 9.5 out of 10 and i think you're going to guess why it doesn't get the perfect 10 pickles we need some pickles on this it would really really add the flavor overall to it above and beyond what it already is which is amazing but let me just say as it stands super delicious guys 9.5 just round it up it's definitely gonna rock solid take care of your appetite and the flavor is awesome a really really unique flavor profile on that one and it's very distinct with each of them the ketchup the mustard the cheeses the onions and obviously the beef that combination together beautiful situation all right now the obvious question did this pizza look like a beautiful situation to you do me a quick favor drop some comments down below are you a fan of cheeseburgers in general and if you are have you had cheeseburger-like pizzas in the past maybe from the other guys drop those comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K closing out another high quality foodie feature for you here on peep this out reviews
