 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty hey everyone welcome back to another high quality  foodie feature for you here on the channel   cheaters cam style after hours once again  over at carl's jr to go in on yet another   blt ranch variant they've got on the menu  and guys this one's looking a bit beefy   so let's get into it it's the all-new blt  ranch double cheeseburger here at carl's   jr and already i am digging the aroma in  my car guys lots of charbroiled goodness   and definitely that's the signature of carl's  jr for sure it's a pretty unmistakable smell   so let's pop the top of this value-sized bun and  actually we've got a decent amount of ranch so   i'm definitely liking that and obviously for  the main stars of the show guys feast your   eyes on the meaty goodness and the cheesy  goodness we've got two 100% all-beef patties   and two slices of american cheese along  with a strip of bacon that's split in half   so that combo is definitely adding to the aroma  in the car and underneath that we obviously have   the tomato the lettuce and underneath that  we have more of the ranch goodness there   along with the bottom of the bun so definitely a  simple ingredients list on this one but actually   guys sometimes like i always say simplicity is  the best way to go and honestly with the main   protein and of course the tastiness of the ranch  i'm thinking this is gonna be pretty tasty so   let's give this a shot it's the all-new blt ranch  double cheeseburger here at carl's jr let's do it that's thick yeah that's definitely pretty  thick and honestly because it's raining   outside right now the cheese is not as melty  as i would have liked it but the flavor   is there and the thickness of those value patties  is pretty good it's pretty much a hearty bite   and then the ranch comes up there guys there's  definitely a lot more ranch in this one and i   am digging it there take a look on the inside  of this a lovely situation of meat and cheese   and as i try to keep the focus with the lighting  here for you as you can see it is not bad for the   value of what you're getting here $3.49 for this  and i got to say guys a very very delicious   tasty double cheeseburger and again i just wish  the cheese was just a little bit more melted but   the ranch is absolutely standing out and  i'm really digging that let's keep going in yeah as i'm getting further into this right now  there's absolutely more ranch in this compared to   the blt ranch big chicken sandwich that i checked  out recently take a look at that review popping up   on your screen right now if you haven't seen that  one the chicken was amazing on that spoiler alert   it was really really tasty but now looking at it  in hindsight i was so blown away by the chicken   i wish there was just more creamy ranch to go  with it because it was really really tasty but   it's really coming through on the burger guys  and again the quality of the charbroiled beef   is really really solid and that american cheese  a beautiful situation again for the third time   i think i just wish it was just more melted  but considering it's raining outside right   now and it's cold this is still fresh but even  still guys very very good let's keep going in lots of ranch in this actually you know as i'm  diving into this all i have in the back of my head   right now is the price point of the mcdouble here  from mcdonald's and i have to admit for something   close to what we're paying for this right now  this is actually a lot more delicious and a lot   more flavorful granted it's not the iconic flavor  of mickey d's for their burger patties but even   still it's very distinctly different over carl's  jr and it's very delicious but i gotta say this   combo of everything on this is nice and the fact  that you're getting bacon for the price point   is definitely a plus guys this is really really  tasty yeah it's too bad they don't have like an   angus thickburger version of something like  this and granted it's just ranch that they're   adding with the regular blt ingredients here and  that's fine but it would have been nice to see   just a larger burger available in addition to the  chicken i know they're pumping the chicken right   now that's their main promo along with this but  considering like i said the price point for what   you're getting the charbroiled goodness is there  and the quality just overall really bangs on   this one guys this is really really good all right  so let's go for one more bite of this one before   we close this one out but i gotta say guys i am  super glad to have given this one a shot right   now because me being a ranch lover i absolutely  wanted to give this a shot anyway but if you're   thinking to yourself is it worth coming out into  the rain to get yeah because like i said i love   ranch charbroiled beef is the bomb put them  together delicious situation let's go for it   well if you've got a carl's jr in the area  this is absolutely worth your time considering   the national average for this one is $2.99  it's actually not bad even at $3.49 because   you are getting bacon you're getting two very  decent beef patties and two slices of cheese   and of course the ranch goodness right there  guys a nice combination and again it definitely   satisfies especially if you're looking for a  little mini cheeseburger in a pinch it's not too   big it's not too small it definitely gets the job  done and it's tasty did i tell you that already   feed you're happy yeah i think i did a few times  actually so with that said i'm gonna have to give   the blt ranch double cheeseburger here at carl's  jr a pretty rock solid 8.5 out of 10   this really could have been a lot better if it  was just a little bit more melty but even still   the flavor was there there was a decent amount  of ranch from top to bottom and overall i'm not   complaining because i didn't even taste the tomato  that's a beautiful situation in and of itself so   guys the combination of the bacon the cheese  the beef on that and that nice little tang of   the ranch is a nice situation and of course the  crunch of the lettuce again a value burger for   what it is but it gets the job done and at $2.99 or  $3.49 depending upon where you live still a banging   value pretty solid all right so a couple of quick  questions for you if you've got a carl's jr in the   area did this actually look pretty tasty to you  right now and if it did are you gonna be giving   this one a shot drop some comments down below and  definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K   closing out another high quality foodie feature  for you here on peep this out reviews cheaters cam   style after hours
