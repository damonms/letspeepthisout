man stay frosty we'll see ya thank you all right guys let's peep this out so here we go with the all-new steak and bacon melt sandwich here at Arby's and already a very lovely situation with that ciabatta guys I'm definitely a fan of the ciabatta over here at Arby's nice and soft with a little bit of toast to it let's take a look on the inside and see what this one is packing looks like we've got some of that pepper bacon action right in there along with that steakhouse ranch on the top they're looking very nice we've got plenty of crispy onions this is Arby's afterall so you got to have that goodness in there we've got melted cheddar cheese and that's all on top of the Petit filet steak which is actually served warm with a pink Center so I'm very excited to get into that of course let's see we can go a little further in here and it looks like more of that steakhouse ranch action on the very bottom but definitely smells pretty amazing it looks pretty awesome it's all the goodies that Arby's does extremely well with those crispy onions and of course the bacon so let's see how this one's gonna deliver this is the all-new steak and bacon melt sandwich here at Arby's let's peep out this flavor yeah just like the last time out I'm glad the sandwich has that diaper in the very back to really catch all of the crispy onions on this one this actually has a lot more crispy onions compared to the garlic butter steak that I reviewed the last time I was here so let's not waste any more time on this one but before I take the first bite and like always if you guys are fans of

here we go it's the steak and bacon melt sandwich part of the petite fillet sandwiches here at Arby's let's do it that is so good right off the break that rich tang from the ranch along with the saltiness of the bacon instantly sets this one off and then immediately into the crispy onions and then a nice tenderness of that petite filet steak guys this is really delicious and that's not even saying anything about the ciabatta bread just yet which I think I should right now of course it's soft and it's got a nice little toastiness to it on top of it but guys super hearty already this is just super flavorful it's Arby's it's delicious you knew it's gonna be look at all the stuff that's in the sandwich let's keep going and I'll go for that close up well it looks like the only casualty when it comes to the flavor of the sandwich is the cheddar cheese and that's not necessarily a bad thing because everything else is so flavorful and like I always say the cheese is typically the glue to hold everything together in this one and as you can see there is a lot to hold together plenty of that petite filet steak in effect and of course the bacon the crispy onions and that Steakhouse ranch goes beautifully with it this is a super delicious sandwich but you know what I'm hoping is gonna make it even better than it already is because it's pretty fantastic on its own horsey sauce let's do it yeah getting horsey with it let's light up this bite right over here and get that horseradish goodness going can't wait to dive into this let's see if that Steakhouse ranch can hang with good ol horsey let's do it mmm oh yeah it does mmm the front-loaded bite of that horsey sauce blends so beautifully with the tanginess of that ranch and in the saltiness of the bacon and then the crispiness of the onions and the deliciousness of the meat guys it just keeps rolling and rolling and rolling and then you get the nice softness of the bun throughout the whole thing guys super delicious let's go for one more bite one more close-up and then we'll finish this one out mmm yeah these petite fillet sandwiches at Arby's are absolutely the truth just a truly delicious blend of flavors with this one with a very distinct difference between the two that are on the menu and I got to say the steakhouse ranch goes amazing with horsey sauce just the bite of that along with the tanginess of it together and then all the other flavors super delicious stuff guys highly recommended on this one so let's just jump right to the rating because I think you all get the point by now with everything you've seen and heard me talk about right now in this review I'm gonna have to give the steak and bacon melt part of the Petit filet sandwiches here at Arby's a rock-solid nine point five 9.5 out of 10 and the only reason this one loses half of a point from that perfect score is because naturally the cheese is just pretty non-existent flavor-wise I get the whole glue holding everything together thing but it would have been nice to get just a little bit of cheese flavor in this one but overall everything else is insane guys everything you've seen is pretty insane I think and you definitely want to give this one a shot it's delicious now of course that leads me into the obvious question are you gonna give this one a shot drop some comments down below have you already given one of these petite filet sandwiches a shot over here at Arby's and if you have which one is your favorite drop those comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K closing out another episode of peep this out bringing you brand new content every single week here on my channel so while you stay tuned for that next review coming real soon in the meantime stay frosty yeah definitely some pretty tasty stuff but the absolute creme de la creme that really enhances whatever Arby's brings out is easily gonna be horsey sauce at least in my opinion this stuff rocks all right everyone until next time I'll talk to you soon but hey real quick before you go in just in case you haven't already take a look at the last review that I put out right up over here along with what I think YouTube's gonna recommend for you to check out as well as always I think you'll find something like in both of them and I'll definitely catch ya in the next one see ya
