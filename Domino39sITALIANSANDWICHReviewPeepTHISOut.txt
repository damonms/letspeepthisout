 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty hey everyone welcome back to another high quality  foodie feature for you here on the channel where   this time i'm over at domino's on a cold and  rainy day to check out another one of their   oven baked sandwiches and i gotta say today's  selection is definitely looking pretty loaded   so without further ado here we go with the italian  sandwich here at domino's and already i'm digging   the presentation of this one guys very inviting in  the bread department nice and toasty let's pop one   of these halves here and take a look underneath  and as you can see we've got some good stuff here   so going down the line we've got pepperoni ham  salami cheese sliced provolone green peppers   banana peppers and onions and i gotta say this  is looking really really nice absolutely a lot   of ingredients in this one and i'm digging the  presentation here so guys let's not waste any more   time on this one this is the italian sandwich  here at domino's let's peep out this flavor   and peep it out we shall right in the middle  of a hail storm guys as i'm filming this at   the moment i am being pelted with ice chips all  over the place right now so let's just get into   this real quick let me show you this one more  time guys a lovely situation this is a super   fun way to film this review right now lots of  goodness on this one guys italian definitely   fits for everything on the inside of this one  and again the toastiness of that bread is pretty   banging already here we go it's the italian  sandwich your dominos let's give it a go oh come on all those meats with the  banana peppers and onions and cheese   come on this is absolutely tasty right now  yeah definitely tasty what's really standing   out amongst all the meats on this is actually  the provolone cheese guys it's very pungent   and i kind of remember what that was like when  i checked out the philly cheesesteak pizza here   i'll make sure to pop that review up on your  screen right now so you can check it out because   it's just as thick just as dense in the cheese  department on top of all the meaty goodness   and guys with the onions with the banana  pepper action that's in there as well   the toastiness of the bread this is a very  lovely situation in the sandwich department   and like i said the italian name really fits  because you're having a lot of different types   of meats on this one that you'd typically find an  italian sandwich of course pepperoni and salami   but guys really really tasty on this one let's  go for a couple more bites this is pretty awesome and again this is a super fun way to film this  review right now you're probably noticing my   arm is lit up here because i have the windows  cracked slightly but guys ice chips and everything   it's really going down on me here i'm telling  you i'm having a blast filming this right now   again take a look at the goodness there  the banana peppers are a nice accent to   this along with the onions if i can just kind  of open this a bit for you as you can see again   there is no shortage of the good stuff on  the inside of this guys this is really nice   very hearty and with a laundry list of  ingredients that you're seeing here how   could this not be good right freshly  baked on top of it let's go in again i just love the fact that the provolone is so  strong on this right now you can really taste the   denseness when you bite into this on top of all  the meats and the onions and the peppers of course   but guys everything on this is singing in the  flavor department and again the toastiness of   that bread is awesome guys just a lovely situation  there top to bottom as you can see freshly baked   freshly made and this is really really tasty  easily worth the money because this really feels   like an a-class sub right now and i gotta say i'm  just digging the overall quality of it and again   considering the amount of toppings this one has  on top of the toastiness of the bread that you're   getting from top to bottom everything combines  beautifully to give you just an awesome sandwich   eating experience right now in the middle of a  hail storm here in southern california who knew   guys let's go for one more bite we'll close  this one up after the rating but a banging   sandwich and again i'm so glad to be filming  this right now this is super fun one more bite all right let me give you a shot of the other  half here so you can check out all the layers   of goodness on this one guys and as you  can see again it is loaded with all the   italian goodness that you'd expect to find  i think mostly in an italian type sandwich   and i'm really digging the overall quality of  this easily one of the best ones on the menu here   and this is definitely fun to go in on with or  without a hail storm just saying yeah this has   easily got to be one of the best sandwiches i've  had over here at domino's since i've been checking   out their sandwich lie which you guys can take  a look at in the domino's playlist popping up   on your screen here right now i've done a few in  the past but guys this one super flavorful just   the right amount of saltiness of those meats and  the pungentness again of that provolone and the   usual pizza cheese they put on here that melted  goodness together is just a banging situation   the toastiness of the bread everything about that  just sings and i think it's easily worth the $7.99   so as if you can't tell already i'm gonna have to  give the italian sandwich over here at domino's a   rock solid 10 out of 10 guys like i said this  one delivered across the board not only was it   super fresh super hot but the toastiness of the  bread and everything on the inside really was   pretty even across the board the flavor was really  really beautiful and i got to admit aside from   the hailstorm that i'm in here right now this is  something that i would easily get again regardless   of the weather so definitely give this one a go  guys if you've got dominos in the area it's an   easy recommendation very tasty all right so i've  got one basic question for you outside of the   usual if you're gonna give this one a go because  i'd venture to guess like i always say if you've   made it this far into the review you're probably  gonna give this one a shot after you check out   my other reviews in the dominos playlist which  one out of the sandwiches that i reviewed already   here on the channel is your personal favorite  drop those comments down below and definitely   let me know and with that this is Ian K closing  out another high quality foodie feature for you   here on peep this out reviews bringing you brand  new content every single week here

by this little graphic   that i'm looking at here right now i think we have  the mediterranean veggie and the buffalo chicken   left i could be wrong there may be some other  ones there you guys let me know down below in the   descriptions based upon my playlist for dominos  and i'll definitely make that happen for you   all right guys until next time i'll talk to you  soon hey thanks for
