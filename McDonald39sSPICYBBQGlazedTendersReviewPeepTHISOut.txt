 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty after checking out the new spicy barbeque chicken sandwich from McDonald's recently it's only fitting that we go in on its quote-unquote companion right and we're doing that right now as we check out the return of the glazed tenders and in this case the new spicy barbecue flavor let's take a look on the inside of this one here I picked up a four-piece order here not too bad in terms of the presentation the size looks fairly decent on them where it really shines so far is that buttermilk coating guys a nice and crispy nice and golden and just a decent amount of this new spicy barbecue sauce which is actually a combination of a Southwestern type of sauce with some hints of jalapeno so looking okay there I wish I had just a little bit more of the barbecue sauce to speak of but overall very crispy and definitely aromatic just like that spicy barbecue chicken sandwich I reviewed yesterday you can definitely check out that review in the upper right hand corner of your display right now looking pretty tasty on this one let's get into it it's the all-new spicy barbecue glazed tenders here at McDonald's lets peep out this flavor yeah these definitely smell pretty sweet but where they already excel is the crispiness and the aroma of that fried goodness in the car right now I got to say it's definitely a lovely situation so

glazed tenders brand new here at McDonald's mmm that's a thick white meat chunk right there well the chicken is definitely heartier and juicier than the version I had in the sandwich yesterday but I have to admit again the sauce itself is not delivering any real spice it's just a very very light sizzle maybe like a 2 on the heat scale if that is just kind of letting you know that it's there but the sweetness of it is very much high up there guys if you like sweet barbecue sauces you're gonna dig this one a lot let's go for another bite and we'll give you that close-up check out the nice chunkiness of that white meat is tender guys I have to admit the coating feels more like it's only 20% there this is solid white meat and you can really taste the quality it is really really nice the crispiness on the outside is definitely on point just not a lot of sauce overall that I have on these tenders but what is here is very sweet but not very spicy but flavorful nonetheless pretty decent okay of course I've got my old standby the classic ranch but I have to admit this is really not gonna be cooling anything down on these tenders right now because there's nothing to cool down because it's literally just like a 2 on the heat scale let's go for a dip and give this a shot yeah buddy I do love me some ranch and with barbecue sauce in general I think it's a perfect companion here looking nice and creamy let's do it this just can't be bad guys it's fried chicken its ranch its barbecue sauce come on now mmm of course it's not bad very rich in fact I'm getting more of a buttermilk type of vibe considering the coating is buttermilk to begin with but when you mix it with that ranch it makes it so much more full flavored it's a really nice combination and again very very light heat but very sweet let's get this one sauced up nicely here and go for one last shot before the final close-up mmm yeah it's delicious all right let me show you another one of these tenders here with a little bit of a coating missing so you guys can really see the quality of the white meat on these tenders is really up there I can see why these are very popular here McDonald so it really doesn't matter what sauce should get with them you're in for a very meaty situation with a very very light coating again I want to say it's about 80% meat 20% coating and that's a lovely ratio because you just want it to accent the flavor of the chicken and not completely overpower a nice situation and the size of the tenders are pretty good highly recommended to give these a go you know I actually like these spicy barbecue glazed tenders better than the chicken sandwich I did yesterday and the fact that I can add ranch to this on top of it is only gonna make it more of a lovely situation like I mentioned in the review the buttermilk flavor really comes through when you add that ranch believe it or not and it mixes amazingly well with the coating of the chicken itself just a very delicious treat and while I wasn't gonna add ranch to that sandwich when I reviewed it yesterday with these tenders you can definitely get a dipping sauce and I don't think that's gonna change the score too much if anything I'd probably rate it a little bit higher because of the fact of the sauce that I chose today but I'm not gonna do that right now so with that said basing these spicy barbecue glazed tenders on their own for what they are I'm gonna have to give them a pretty solid 8.5 out of 10 they definitely deliver the meatiness the coating is definitely thin enough but it's enough of the meat to really complement it and the overall flavor was pretty awesome considering the sweetness of the sauce itself which I'm not really a super fan of but guys very delicious either way even if the heat was a little on the lower side like I said maybe a 2 out of 10 so if you're a spice head definitely adjust your expectations accordingly now the question is spice head or not are you gonna give these tenders a shot drop those comments down below how excited are you to give the buttermilk tenders a shot over here with this quote-unquote spicy barbecue sauce very curious to hear
