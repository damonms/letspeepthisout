 what's going on everyone and welcome to  the channel it's Ian K where today I'm   back on over at Papa John's this time to  go in in the final selection off of their   all new crustless pizza options now  on the menu for a limited time only   that's right so stay tuned because I've  got the chicken alfredo papa bowl up next   welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K   stay frosty so did I save the best for last well   I'm about to find out and you guys are coming  along for the ride Feast to rise on the chicken   alfredo Papa Bowl here at Papa John's and as you  can see a very creamy situation for sure let's   break this one on down real fast yes sir this one  looks to be bringing the creaminess for sure what   we've got here is a nice tray filled with creamy  alfredo sauce parmesan Romano grilled chicken   spinach mushrooms Roma tomatoes onions three  melted cheeses and Italian seasonings and guys   very very nice in the presentation just looking  at this directly you'd think that there'd be some   pasta underneath this but it is all the toppings  that you just heard there guys looking really nice   very cheesy and very creamy so let's not waste any  more time on this one this is the all-new chicken   alfredo Papa Bowl here at Papa John's let's  peep out this flavor yeah I got to be careful   with this one leaning forward guys all that creamy  cheesy goodness is going to slide to the very end   closer to you and honestly this is looking pretty  appetizing so if you want to lick the screen go   right ahead this is looking really really nice let  me grab a little of everything here and there is   a nice amount of cheese wow this is really nice  take a look at that guys creamy cheesy goodness   very very lovely let's give this a shot got  some onions falling all over the place here   it's the all-new chicken alfredo papa bowl here  at Papa John's we're peeping this out right now mmm wow wow oh man this is the  best out of the three mmm   now nothing against the garden veggie which  I just checked out along with the Italian   meats trio pretty recently guys take a look  at those reviews popping up on your screen   here right now a very lovely situation with  this one but the flavor is way way up there   in terms of what I'm expecting with this one  and I gotta say I was expecting a lot so let   me go for more of this because this is crazy  good crazy flavorful and there is just plenty   of goodness glistening in the sun guys very nice  let's keep going and I'm totally digging this one mmm the grilled chicken the cheese the Italian  seasonings all it really needs is pasta believe   it or not that's it or maybe some pizza crust  because guys this is really a delicious chicken   alfredo situation so I can imagine having this  like in handheld form or like a papadia that's   definitely the way to go but on its own  for a keto friendly option guys this is   only 570 calories for the whole tray with 15  grams of carbs so a few keto heads out there   know this already you shouldn't be exceeding 50  grams of carbs a day and naturally with only 15   in this whole thing you can pretty much feel  good about killing this whole tray actually   this is really really nice not bad whatsoever  let's go for another few on this pretty tasty   mmm man you know at first glance I thought this  was going to be a little bit more on the oily   side and there's definitely some oils pooling up  just a little bit here but the flavor is off the   chart the Alfredo sauce has a nice creaminess  to it and the saltiness that I'm getting from   that is amazing as well and then when you add in  the chicken the mushrooms the spinach the onions   guys even the roma tomato action here this is  just beautiful guys especially in the sunlight   right there and that three cheese action the  parmesan Romano also adding just the right amount   of tanginess and pungentness to it this is very  very tasty let's go for a couple more very good   wow very hearty definitely satisfying  easily the best of the three   but if any of these three are not really to  your liking you actually have a create your   own option so that's actually on the official  menu as well but naturally these are the three   ones that are kind of pseudo pre-made they're  made fresh but these are the ones that you can   order by name and they come pre-configured when  they make it for you but this is really really   awesome guys I'm gonna go for one more bite on  this one I think because I want to save the rest   of this for a little bit later but guys a very  lovely situation I love the spinach I love the   overall flavor of everything here the onions the  chicken everything about this is super flavorful   for alfredo one more bite we'll wrap the review  up with the rating coming up next but guys again   I really did Save The Best For Last this is  super delicious and I'm glad I'm finishing out   my look at these with this particular one pretty  banging one more bite we'll close it out hang on   all right well the portion size isn't bad for $7.99  guys and again the freshness of the ingredients   are very well done on this naturally with that  grilled chicken action the spinach the mushroom   the tomatoes the onions and of course the Italian  seasonings along with the melted cheese you have   something very hearty and something you can kind  of feel good about in terms of the carb Department   even though it's 570 calories this is something I  think you can easily incorporate into your daily   need for food but guys very very tasty on this  one easily worth checking out better ingredients   better Pizza Papa John's man I wish I had a couple  of breadsticks to go in on with this one guys but   then again that would defeat the purpose of what  that actually is considering it's crustless pizza   technically with all the toppings but guys again  that would be a beautiful situation in terms of   pasta that is just really really well done so just  to confirm it for you I'm gonna have to give the   all-new chicken alfredo poppable here at Papa  John's the well-deserved 10 out of 10 obviously   right I mean guys I was pretty much in love with  that after the first bite the flavor is just so rich   so vibrant and naturally the creaminess along with  the melted cheese and the Italian seasonings that   combination is a beautiful thing on top of the  grilled chicken and everything else in that with   the onions the spinach guys just easily it is  the best one out of the group and again nothing   against the other two that I've checked out  but that is something I would easily Rock again   it's well worth your time as if you couldn't tell  already right all right so do me a quick favor now   that I've completed my look and all three of these  papa bowls here at Papa John's drop some comments   down below which was your particular favorite if  you've tried all three or at least based upon my   reviews in terms of the appearance department and  naturally if there's something that you can change   on that particular one what would you change and  why drop those comments down below and definitely   let me know and with that this is Ian K closing  out another high quality foodie feature for you   here on peep this out reviews bringing you brand  new content every single week here on my channel   so while you stay tuned for that next review  coming real soon in the meantime stay frosty   all right Papa John's if you're open to  suggestions I'm definitely looking forward   to hopefully trying a cheeseburger variant  of something like this in the future I think   that would be a beautiful thing guys I can only  imagine a bunch of pickles cheeseburger sauce   something kind of mixed in with the cheese make  it happen Papa John's please all right everyone   until next time I'll talk to you soon hey thanks  for checking out another one of my reviews but   just in case you
