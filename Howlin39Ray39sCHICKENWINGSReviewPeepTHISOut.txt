 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty what's going on everyone and welcome or  welcome back to the channel it's Ian K   where today i ventured on over to howlin rays in  pasadena california to local pickup and delivery   location to scoop up some of their awesome chicken  wings that i hear a lot of good things about and   i gotta say not only am i hearing a lot of good  things about them i'm seeing a lot of good things   about them guys feast your eyes on what i've got  here in front of me this looks really really nice   as i try and tilt the box forward chicken wing  goodness from howlin rays as you can see down   at the bottom of the box there we've got a very  nice situation to get in on let's break this one   on down real fast all right so very simply what  i've got here are three jumbo sized whole wings   battered up and fried to a crispy golden brown  before they're hit with the seasoned goodness   as you can see here guys these are looking really  nice nice and dark a little threatening a little   on the red side but the heat level here is medium  so i'm expecting these to be just a little sizzly   but not too bad but overall guys a very lovely  situation and considering there are three here   i have to say that's actually a total of six  wings technically a very lovely situation once   we split these on the bottom they throw in a  slice of bread and a bunch of pickles and guys   for dipping we're actually going to be going in  on their in-house comeback sauce this is going to   be a lovely situation once we get further in but  guys overall the presentation is looking really   nice the aroma's smelling pretty nice let's not  waste any more time on these these are the popular   chicken wings over here at howlin rays let's peep  out this flavor yes sir howlin rays is known for   their legendary sandwich over here guys but these  wings i have to say are looking really really nice   almost up there in the presentation guys and i  have to say with the sandwich which is jumping   up on your screen here right now that i reviewed  a while back that was a beautiful situation indeed   but i gotta say with these wings i'm totally  digging what i'm seeing here right now let me   scoop one of these up real fast here wow these  are looking nice very very thick take a look at   this guys season perfectly these are dusted very  nice and you can see they are fried up and golden   very lovely situation on these here let  me actually break one of these here wow wow wow wow very juicy on these  i got to be careful this dust is   all over my fingers it's a little on the greasy  side but guys loveliness all around let's give   this a go it's the chicken wings at howlin rays  here in pasadena california let's peep this out juicy a little salty ooo medium heat   actually this feels a little bit more  than medium heat it's elevated hang on super super flavorful on this one guys man the  white meat is nice on these take a look at this   nice and meaty nice and juicy a  very thick amount of meat on these   and i have to say this is how you want to  have chicken wings nothing against the little   caesar wings that i actually reviewed a couple of  weeks ago you probably saw that review recently   these are infinitely better because they're  bigger let's keep going in pretty nice wow that crispy coating is banging i might have  a little trouble finishing this review here guys   the heat level is really beginning to elevate  the medium is actually very very hot for me   and it really is noticeable but it's not  taking away from the pleasurable experience   of going in on these wings as you can see a  very solid amount of meat and overall guys   nice and juicy you can really see it is  lit up beautifully here i love the fact   that they're jumbo sized as well you really feel  like you're getting your money's worth with this   pretty nice but wow houston i think we have a  problem here this is definitely a heated situation and it doesn't help the fact that it's over  90 degrees here in southern cali right now so   let me see if i can try and cool it down  just a bit with some of their comeback   sauce they actually make this in-house guys  and this is a specialty i guess it's kind of   like their version of canes sauce from  raising canes it looks kind of similar   actually very very nice in this let's give it a  shot see what this does to the overall heat level   as i'm kind of beginning to lose my  voice slightly here let's go for it oh yeah that zip that i'm getting from  that sauce not quite thousand island but   some sweetness creaminess and it's helping  out with the heat but wow the coating on   these wings is definitely beautiful guys  so nice on this let me go for another dip   while my fingers are lit up this is definitely  fun to eat just with this one guys it's pretty   substantial in the appetite killing department  this is really good let's go for another couple mmm that is so good so good and because i am not going to get into the bread  here let me actually go for a pickle with a little   bit of this comeback sauce here wow this is very  messy but nice thickness on these pickles guys   looking really nice let's give it a go mmm nice  and thick just like on the sandwich really really   good okay let me break off the end of this one  here and we'll go for a flat i like the fact that   i technically have a six piece wing situation here  right now it kind of makes it worth it considering   the $10 price point all right so let me flip  this one around we're gonna go for a little   bit more of that comeback sauce here and again my  fingers everything is very messy here right now   and i'll try and take down this flat all at one  time because this is looking very very nice guys   i'm really digging the amount of sauce here they  give you a couple too which is kind of nice but   a little goes a long way with this you don't  really need a lot of it all right here we go   one more time lovely situation i just love  how it looks guys beautiful here we go oh mmm so good so good and because i've got a  little piece left over here let's go for one   last one before we wrap the review up  at the rating coming up next but guys   very lovely situation if you guys have  howlin rays anywhere in your vicinity   especially if you're here on the west coast  naturally you want to give the wings a shot   don't sleep on these these are really tasty  one more bite and we'll close this one out hang on make sure you've got plenty of napkins with this  one because as you can see by my fingers here   guys they are not playing around these things  are huge but they are absolutely lit up with   that seasoning very nicely it's going to get all  over the place what you're going to get here are   three oversized wings very nicely put together  and once you pair it up with their comeback   sauce you already know what it is guys a flavor  showcase and a real testament to the quality over   here at howlin rays outside of their regular  sandwich this is a pretty banging situation okay so with everything you've seen and heard up  to this point i'm gonna have to give the chicken   wings over here at howlin rays an awesome 9  out of 10 guys a very beautiful situation across   the board with those and the fact that they were  jumbo sized on top of it i really didn't feel   like i was getting ripped off for ten dollars  here because naturally they're oversized you   get three of them so technically it's two wings  per six wings not too bad you do get a slice of   bread and of course the pickles to go with a nice  combination overall but guys i gotta tell you be   very careful with that one in terms of the napkin  department make sure you've got plenty of them on   hand and thankfully they do give you a little  washcloth kind of like one of those portable   ones to use afterwards you really need that  these wings are definitely something to check   out especially if you've already had their  legendary chicken sandwich guys i gotta say   this is nice to have an option on the menu and  of course it's chicken how could they not offer   something like this right truly delicious stuff  all right so for any of you peeps who have already   been to howlin rays here in southern cali do you  actually get the chicken wings over the sandwich   or vice versa which is your personal favorite and  why drop those comments down below and definitely   let me know and with that this is Ian K closing  out another high quality foodie feature for you   here on peep this out reviews bringing you brand  new content every single week here on my channel   so while you stay tuned for that next review coming real  soon in the meantime stay frosty yes sir keep it   howlin indeed after such a fun experience  checking out the sandwich as well as these   wings i'm gonna have to go in a few other
