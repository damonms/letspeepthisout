 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty what's going on everyone and welcome back  to another high quality foodie feature for   you here on the channel where this time i've  ordered a good old mr beast burger to check   out their latest limited time only collabo  with charles white jr aka moist cr1tikal   so without further ado let's get into it guys  feast your eyes on the moist cheese and i gotta   say this is looking like a very sloppy joe-like  production in front of me here right now guys   there is lots of goodness in the very middle  right there and again it does remind me a sloppy   joe this is looking pretty tasty so starting off  with the obvious it looks like we've got a nice   toasted roll a little on the soft side so it's  obviously sticking to all that meat right there   guys but what this sandwich is comprised of is  chopped seasoned ground beef caramelized onions   american cheese shredded iceberg lettuce mayo and  hot sauce and like i said earlier i'm getting lots   of vibes of sloppy joe with this one here guys  this is actually looking really nice and ultra   plentiful for the amount that's in the sandwich  especially since it's close to ten dollars for   this i'm really glad the meat is pretty plentiful  on it so let's see if all those ingredients are   going to sing in the flavor department this is the  all new moist cheese the collabo between mr beast   and moist cr1tikal let's peep out this flavor  well i gotta say as tasty as this looks this is   absolutely dangerous to review in the car right  now guys this meat is very loose and i'm being   very careful with everything i really wish i had  a burger diaper in the back of this one just to   catch it but as you can see very plentiful with  plenty of caramelized onions and that cheese   mixed up this is really looking good and again for  like the third or fourth time a sloppy joe-like   presentation and i'm kind of digging that because  i haven't had sloppy joe in a minute guys let's   get into it it's the all-new moist cheese from mr  beast burger let's do it mmm sloppy joe wow but with   a little bit of hot sauce which admittedly is not  too crazy it's just a little bit of a sizzle but   man guys very very thick in the cheese and meat  department this is really awesome because it's all   chopped up with the caramelized onion goodness the  nice oil that i'm getting from that as well very   nice i'm not even tasting the tomato because it's  ultra flavorful let's keep going it's pretty good yeah i'm not gonna stunt on this one guys this  actually feels like a double patty of meat with   plenty of cheese melted throughout and again  with the caramelized onion goodness right over   here a very lovely situation more moisture is  being added because of the mayo and obviously   the tomato itself but i'm not really tasting that  the hot sauce is doing its best to try and keep   up with everything here but it's very thick in  the cheese and meat department and i'm perfectly   okay with that yeah i'm definitely digging the  amount of meat in this one guys there's plenty   of cheese plenty of caramelized onions and again  i'm getting that sloppy joe manwich type of vibe   those canned goods from back in the day you guys  probably remember those it was actually pretty   tasty it literally was a sloppy joe i think they  called it manwich is what it was but guys again   very very tasty on this just a very solid  amount of meat and again it does feel like   two patties worth let's keep going in  for a couple more this is really tasty yeah all the other ingredients in this one really  don't hold a candle to the main protein in this   one guys and again with at least two patties  worth of beef it really feels almost like a half   pound if not more it's very hefty in the hands  i'm really digging that overall quality because   A) i definitely love a lot of melted cheese on my  beef and B) the caramelized onions is a beautiful   situation so i like the fact that they're going  for the chopped up angle for this or also would   have been just like any other burger on the menu  but they're calling this a moist cheese sandwich   at the same time but it's got plenty of beef  plenty of flavor and again that hot sauce even   though it's kind of there it's giving just a  little bit of sizzle in general very very tasty   on this all right so let's go for one more bite  in this one guys because this really does almost   feel like a restaurant style sandwich it's hefty  it's hearty and it's definitely close to the $10   range obviously for it before the delivery  but even still guys very delicious stuff and   i'm glad to have checked out this one a pretty  cool collabo between mr beast and moist cr1tikal   all right one more bite we'll wrap this one up  hang on yeah definitely a very messy sandwich to   review in the car guys you got to be very careful  with this one but what you're going to get is an   overabundance of a very flavorful seasoned  ground beef situation mixed up with plenty of   melted cheese and the caramelized onions a very  lovely situation indeed and like i said all the   other ingredients are passable but it doesn't  hold a candle to the overall flavor of what   you got in front of you here right now in the meat  department and the cheese department and the onion   department pretty tasty stuff just open up your  favorite delivery apps and search mr beast burger   yeah messy factory aside it was definitely  moist and it was definitely full of cheese   a very delicious burger over here at mr beast and  it is a limited time only thing although i do wish   this actually would stay on the menu a lot longer  hopefully it will because i think this is going to   be pretty successful it's pretty tasty so with  that said i'm going to have to give the collabo   between mr beast and moist cr1tikal the moist  cheese a very solid 9 out of 10 guys like   i said the flavor delivered on this one plenty of  beef on the inside of that plenty of cheese plenty   of caramelized onions with passable ingredients to  go around it but even still very hearty to hold in   the hands and guys again very much worth i think  close to ten dollars before the delivery if you   can get a small deal on the delivery i'd highly  recommend it i went through postmates myself but   i gotta say again i really really enjoyed this one  and it was very hearty very delicious definitely   check it out if you can alright so now the obvious  question are you going to be giving this one a   shot drop some comments down below do you actually  order from mr beast in general and if you do what   are some of the main things that you like to  get on their menu and obviously how excited   are you to give
