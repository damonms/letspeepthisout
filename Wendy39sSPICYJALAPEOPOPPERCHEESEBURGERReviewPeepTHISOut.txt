 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty hey everyone welcome back to another high quality  foodie feature for you here on the channel   over at wendy's once again because they've  still got it going on with their limited   time only jalapeno popper menu and we're  definitely doing something different with it   yeah different but i think a little expected  guys feast your eyes on the jalapeno popper   cheeseburger and i am already digging this already  because it's all those amazing toppings from the   chicken sandwich variant but with some fresh never  frozen beef so to break this one down really quick   we've got that standard soft brioche style bun and  underneath it a very nice amount of that jalapeno   cream cheese action along with those sliced  jalapenos guys there is no shortage of it a lovely   situation and that's in addition to a cheese sauce  along with shredded pepper jack cheese guys along   with the bacon action that you're seeing there  and that's all sitting on top of a quarter pound   fresh never frozen beef patty because you  gotta do that guys it's wendy's after all   these toppings are made for this type of burger  nothing on the bottom of it there but i don't   think it needs anything else because it's got  everything on top so yeah i had to give this one   a shot with all those toppings along with the beef  over here at wendy's because like i said earlier   guys it's wendy's it's hamburgers you gotta give  this a shot in addition to the chicken sandwich   so let's give this one a go it's the jalapeno  popper cheeseburger here at wendy's let's do it just as good just as good man that heat is  beginning to build but before i get this   breakdown going as my mouth is watering shout  out to youtuber sammiyt i appreciate the info   on this one this is a lovely situation to go  for in burger form guys because of all the   cheesy goodness on top of it and the bacon and  coming back to that heat yes the jalapenos are   adding to this the overall spiciness of the  cream cheese itself as well guys it's just a   lovely situation of goodness with that fresh  never frozen beef over here at wendy's it's   very distinct it's very wendy's when you taste it  but guys a lovely situation already let's go for   one more bite on this one before we get further  into the review we'll give you a close-up hang on jalapeno cream cheese on a burger yeah this is  definitely a thing guys the combination of all of   that is a lovely situation with the nice robust  beef flavor that i'm getting on the bottom and   that's in addition to the bacon going with this  as well there's a lot of cheesy goodness with this   but the strong tanginess that i'm getting from the  cream cheese is awesome on top of everything else   here guys just a lovely situation and of course  that nice soft bun to get this into my face   it just delivers a total package in flavor so  far very nice all right now one thing to note   swapping out the chicken for the burger is gonna  make this feel just a little bit smaller than i   thought the chicken sandwich was initially the  first time around which if you haven't seen that   review it's popping up on your screen right now  definitely check that one out i thought it was   just a little bit smaller then and even though the  thicker chicken patty was awesome the thinness of   this beef patty even though it's a quarter pound  of beef is definitely making us feel even smaller   than that so guys it's nice having the flavor but  again i would have really appreciated maybe just   a little bit of a bigger burger because i think  it warrants it given the toppings on this and   considering the bun action on this one it still  does feel kind of small let's go for another bite but even still the quality of those ingredients  along with that beef is really coming through   right now so the flavor is definitely up  there and like i said earlier the beef   flavor is adding so much to everything here  in addition to the steaminess of the heat   that i'm getting in the back of my throat  here right now just a nice combination with   that jalapeno cream cheese kind of fighting with  itself to be a little spicy but to cool it down   be a little spicy cool it down definitely loving  this guys it's really good and i love the fact   that there's no shortage of it whatsoever they  definitely go heavy-handed with it as well so   if you like cream cheese you are absolutely  gonna dig this version or the chicken version   they're both pretty awesome with that cream cheese  action in effect so one more bite we'll close this   one out after the rating but guys again another  awesome sandwich over here at wendy's whether   it's beef or chicken beautiful condiments  to go with guys a lovely thing here we go   all right so let's go around the world with  this one here and as you guys can see again   another lovely showcase of the condiments over  here this is really a delicious variant of this   with the beef and again with all that cheesy  goodness there how could you not pair this up   with some of the fresh never frozen beef over here  at wendy's just a really awesome alternative and   i'd probably recommend you give this one a  shot in addition to the chicken very quickly   lovely stuff so with all that said i'm going to  have to give the jalapeno popper cheeseburger here   at wendy's a rock solid 9 out of 10 guys this  is right up there with a chicken sandwich you're   just swapping out the protein and the flavors  are definitely awesome they're so distinct so   different but everything else you're getting  with that with that jalapeno cream cheese the   cheese sauce the bacon the sliced jalapenos the  combination works beautifully i would even venture   to try that with fish believe it or not because  i think that would be kind of awesome as well   but guys a lovely situation definitely give the  burger version a shot all right question time are   you going to be giving this one a shot drop some  comments down below let me know if you're going   to be giving any of the items off the new jalapeno  popper menu here at wendy's ago and if you are are   you actually going to swap out the burger before  you try the chicken or vice versa drop those   comments down below and definitely let me know  and with that this is Ian K closing
