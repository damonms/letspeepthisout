 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty hey everyone welcome back to another high quality  foodie feature here on the channel where this time   i'm over a jack in the box because they're looking  to cluck up the game big time by introducing a   brand new chicken sandwich in the ever popular  chicken sandwich wars guys feast your eyes on   the appropriately named cluck sandwich and at  first glance this is going to look pretty similar   to another very popular chicken sandwich but  let's pop the top of this brioche style bun and   see what we've got here looks like plenty of what  they're calling a mystery sauce and guys it looks   pretty tasty and what we've got here aside from  that is three pickles on the very top of the bun   and that's all sitting on top of a new thicker  white meat chicken fillet and just so you guys   know i opted to go for the spicy variant on this  one so we're going to see what that actually does   overall to the flavor but guys not too bad in the  size department for what this is but it does seem   just a little smaller than what i'm used to on  the very bottom we've got a little bit more of   that mystery sauce and that's it so guys let's  not waste any more time on this one let's get   into it it's the all new cluck sandwich here at  jack-in-the-box let's peep out this flavor well   as you just saw it seems like the prerequisite  for chicken sandwiches these days is to come   in a nice little foil package and jack-in-the-box  is no exception take a look at that the marketing   is pretty slick on this guys i really dig the  way that this looks here and of course it's a   very familiar foil pouch with their marketing  branding on the front of it of course but guys   again take a look at the sandwich itself it's a  little on the smaller side i mean it's definitely   a larger chicken patty for sure but overall  the bun itself is a little small but still   very similar to another very very popular chicken  sandwich that's out right now but even still i'm   digging the marketing name guys the cluck sandwich  that's jack in the box through and through   all right so let's not waste any more time on  this one let's see if this is actually going   to deliver again this is the brand new cluck  sandwich here with jack-in-the-box let's do it that's different i'm getting a pretty super sweet  highly tangy sauce flavor on this one guys i can't   really put my finger on it again it's a mystery  right the name is pretty perfect for this it's   kind of like a cross between maybe a little bit  of thousand island and honey mustard believe it   or not but the tang is up there overall the patty  itself not too bad in the juiciness department it   is a little on the smaller side as you can see  but overall looks very similar to what you're   thinking what it's probably looking like from the  other guys and still the pickles i haven't even   gotten to yet that was pretty much all chicken and  sauce and the bun but again the bun nice and soft   there guys not bad at all so let's keep going in  but so far different but tasty let's keep going pickle well there's definitely some nice  crunch to the chicken and when you add those   three pickles into the mix with their own  snap acidity and crunch all on their own   mixing that with that sauce you're getting  a nice flavor profile which is distinctly   different from the other chicken sandwiches that  i've had even though it looks very similar to the   other guys and i keep coming back to that  because guys it really does look the part   the only difference however is although this is  a thicker patty it doesn't really seem like it   when i'm biting into it it's definitely thicker  for jack in the box that i've had in the past   but when it comes to what's out there competition  wise it's a little lacking but the flavor is   decent on it guys and again that soft brioche  style bun you gotta love the nice shine the   nice sheen on the very top there pretty good but  on the reel that sauce is really playing with my   head right now so let me go for another bite of  this real quick to see if i can try and place   it just a little bit because guys it really  is appropriately named mystery because that's   exactly what it is it's very very different but  highly tangy and highly sweet let's go in again   hmm they should really package that sauce on its  own and put it with their chicken tenders or their   nuggets i think it'd be pretty awesome but man i  really really like it and honestly that's what's   going to kind of kick this one up a couple of  points because it is distinctly different from   all the other competitive chicken sandwiches out  there and i really do like it the only thing i   don't like and i got to be honest with you guys  as i always am is the price point on this $4.79 it's   definitely not competitive in the price department  considering the size a little bit smaller   but again it is what it is maybe it's just a  west coast thing i don't know but even still   not bad so let me go for one more bite of this one  then we'll wrap up this review after the rating   but guys another competitive chicken sandwich on  the landscape right now when it comes to fast food   with plenty more to come i'm sure let's go for it  so let's do a little 360 action to round this one   out and as you can see this one has definitely got  all the boxes checked for what a chicken sandwich   should have nowadays you've got the main chicken  itself the pickles a sauce an ice brioche bun   and overall just a very very nice chicken  eating experience the only downside to this one   is the price point that really is the main  thing and the size of the chicken itself so   what you're getting is flavorful here but i have  to admit i'd love to see actually that sauce again   packaged separately i think that's what's  really selling this one for me personally   and that's what makes it totally worth checking  out it really is worth it just for that order on   ubereats postmates and grubhub so yeah pretty  tasty on this one and definitely something to   check out for sure but just so you guys know you  do have options when it comes to these new chicken   sandwiches over here at jack because they've got  a deluxe version on the menu as well which you're   not gonna have to wait too long to check out here  on the channel it is definitely coming soon alright   so as for this variant with the cluck sandwich  being as it is i'm gonna have to give that one   a pretty decent 7.8 out of 10 it's not the be  all end all of chicken sandwiches but the sauce   definitely is when it comes to the sauce menu over  here jack-in-the-box that is very very tasty and i   have to admit aside from their buttermilk ranch  sauce which is pretty awesome i would love to   see that again on some other products over here  because this sauce the mystery sauce pretty tasty   stuff guys pretty tasty all right so here comes  captain obvious with the question for you are   you going to be giving this one a shot if you've  got jack in the box in the area how excited are   you to give this chicken sandwich a shot over here  aka the cluck sandwich again i love the marketing   that's pretty slick or are you just pretty much  sick of chicken sandwiches in general drop those   comments down below and definitely let me know and  with that this is Ian K closing out another high   quality foodie feature for you here on peep this  out reviews bringing you brand new content every   single week here on my channel so while you stay  tuned for that next review coming real soon   in the meantime stay frosty you didn't cluck this  one up too bad jack the patty just needs to be a   little bit thicker and the price is a little bit  more competitive but still very tasty all right   guys until next time i'll talk to you soon hey  thanks for checking out another one of my reviews
