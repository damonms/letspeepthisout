wrap one of the new roasted chicken wraps here and I got to say this is looking really really tasty lots of ranchy goodness falling out each of these halves here guys looking really nice on the inside of this artisan wrap we've got a lot of goodness here starting off with the obvious we've got some roasted chicken pepper bacon fire roasted jalapenos red onion lettuce tomatoes and of course ranch to go with and I gotta say it looks very hefty for sure split down the middle is how it comes here and I got to say I am digging the presentation I love the light toastiness and that artisan wrap itself but on the inside all of that ranchy goodness I love ranch so I'm super excited to try this right now I don't know about the tomatoes but this is looking really really good so let's see if the flavor is gonna deliver on this one how could it possibly not with a laundry list like that it's the jalapeno bacon ranch chicken wrap here at Arby's part of their new market fresh menu let's peep out this flavor yeah when I saw this actually had fire roasted jalapenos and pepper bacon I was sold just right there guys and I have to admit they definitely are fire roasted look at them right there in the middle they are toasted up looking really really nice I'm not really feeling that tomato just yet but even still everything else in this I think is gonna be awesome so we're definitely gonna get into this like always but right before that first bite of course I got to let you know if you guys are fans of high quality delicious looking food reviews make sure to hit that subscribe button down below

pretty fantastic mmm and it is oh no no no no no no oh I'm not feeling that tomato oh my god no that is really standing out very strong right now to me but okay here come the other flavors the jalapeno heat that I'm getting right now is definitely there keep working your magic please okay that tomato's mostly gone mmm man that was rough but thankfully the jalapenos right now they're still sizzling in the background there is a lot of heat with this and actually you know what even with the ranch it's not really doing too much to the heat the fire roasted goodness that's in here is easily on display there's a lot of leafy lettuce in here it almost feels like a salad inside the wrap but I'm really really digging this so far nothing yet in terms of the bacon but as you can see lots of greenery here guys you've got the leaf lettuce you've got the jalapenos but a lovely situation and of course the chicken that I'm kind of tasting but again it really feels more like a salad so far let's go for another bite mmm all right a little bit of that pepper bacon is coming through right now but man that heat is really beginning to pick up right now and the jalapenos are no joke on this guy's the flavorfulness of the chicken is actually really good as well and the overall feeling and texture light powderiness that I'm getting from the artisan wrap it's pretty awesome as well but wow that is really beginning to pick up steam let me give you a close-up here as you can see a decent amount on the inside the Bacon's a little light on this half but there is plenty of the roasted jalapeno action to go with but man my mouth is beginning to go right now I had no idea I probably should have brought a drink again I forgot a drink this is not working for me right now and it's kind of crispy today on top of it let's go for another bite and we'll just keep going in further with this guys its tasty it is mmm yeah that was pretty much it for the bacon in this half but what I did get was pretty good guys but honestly I liked it the ranch is good of course I love ranch but those jalapenos those roasted jalapenos are taking it up a notch big-time they are really like all over the place and you'd think jalapeno's gonna be the main ingredient it's the first name in the title and they have plenty of them on the inside of here so this half that I'm having right now not a real good distribution of the main ingredients in this half at least there I'm getting plenty of the jalapenos which is great plenty of lettuce naturally the ranch is there but the overall chickens a little on the light side but what is there is flavorful and the bacon is pretty much nill after that second buy pretty much it was pretty much done so decent for what this is nice quality because of what you're getting but I really wish it was a little bit more evenly distributed in terms of everything together when you cut it in half you shouldn't kind of have one more than the other on the other side but it is what it is what can you do let me go one more bite with this one we'll give you another close-up of the other half but guys pretty tasty for my first wrap we'll be here at least market fresh from Arby's pretty good well the next time out with this one I'm definitely gonna 86 that tomato and make sure that there's a little bit more bacon on the inside but everything else that is here is very very nice guys very fresh on that leaf lettuce there's plenty of ranch and those roasted jalapenos are pretty bomb in addition to the red onion which I haven't really mentioned so right now adding just a little bit of extra crunch I just would have liked to have a little bit more of distribution of all the ingredients a little bit more plentiful on each side but what you're getting here guys is still pretty tasty it is worth a shot oh and did I mention that the jalapenos really deliver on this one yeah there's plenty of chopped goodness on the inside of this and the spice is absolutely there so that was a major highlight so with that said I'm gonna have to give the jalapeno a bacon ranch chicken wrap as part of the New Market Fresh menu here at Arby's just an OK 7 out of 10 now keep in mind this really didn't start off very well with that first bite of that tomato really setting the tone and honestly all the other flavors began to do their due right after that and I'm glad about it but let me just say overall I wish that the ingredients could have been a little bit more evenly distributed maybe a little bit more of them on the inside there is no shortage of lettuce whatsoever in that naturally it feels like I'm eating kind of like a big salad and that's okay because it's market fresh it's a different type of thing but I really wish that we list a little bit more of everything on the inside especially in the bacon department to really kind of stand out just a little bit but what you're getting still very flavorful and it is worth a shot
