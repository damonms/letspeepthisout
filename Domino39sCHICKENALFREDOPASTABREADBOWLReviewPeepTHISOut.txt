 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty all right everyone let's get it it's Ian K back  again with another high quality foodie feature   for you here on peep this out reviews this time  returning to domino's to check out another one   of their tasty looking pasta bread bowls and  considering today's selection i think i'm in   for a real treat so let's get started feast your  eyes on their chicken alfredo pasta bread bowl and   what's easily a very "carby" situation but a very  beautifully smelling situation at the same time   guys lots of hints of garlic and olive oil in the  air as you can see we've got a nice toasted bread   bowl filled with penne pasta premium chicken and  alfredo sauce and i gotta say it smells glorious   like i said the garlic in the olive oil is  really lighting up the car beautifully here   and i'm really digging how toasty the edges of  this bowl look here as you can see it seems to be   dusted with that garlic and olive oil that's where  it's coming from but i have no doubt that it's all   throughout this right now because it's very strong  so let's see if this one's going to deliver that   ultimate flavor it's the chicken alfredo pasta  bread bowl here at domino's let's peep out this   flavor you know this looks like it's maybe a  little above seven inches in diameter here maybe   a little bit bigger than a personal pizza but as  you guys can see i know it's a little contrast to   here with the white it's very dense and very thick  and i'm really digging all those seasonings that   you can see in the outside of the bowl there  guys it's looking really really nice and again   it doesn't seem like there's any cheese on this  at all really more of the sauce and that premium   chicken and the penne pasta but even still guys it  looks really nice okay so real quick before i get   into this and like always if you guys are fans  of high quality delicious looking food reviews   make sure to hit that subscribe button down below  and don't forget to tap that bell icon so you can   be notified as soon as brand new content drops  every week guys let's do this let me pick up a   little bit of everything here a little bit of the  chicken a little bit of the penne action it is a   very very contrasty situation but as you can see  very very nice and the penny pasta as it's falling   over there feels a little al dente it doesn't  really feel super soft let's give it a shot oh that's perfect actually wow lemme pick that one up there real quick let me go for one more bite and   i'll give you that breakdown but creamy guys  really really creamy on this feast your eyes   one more time really really good well maybe not  one more time but you know what i mean hang on that's nice well after that second bite i'm  not going to say this is one of the best   alfredo sauces i've ever had but considering  it's fast food alfredo and there's really not   too many of those out there this is actually  pretty nice it is rich it is creamy although i   do wish it had just a little bit more salt  to elevate that flavor just a little bit   but again the garlic is very nice on this one you  can really taste that in here and also the chicken   is very solid as well guys just overall a nice  combination of those flavors yeah what appears   to be that garlic olive oil type of wash that it's  got is really giving this little bit of the extra   pop that i'm looking for and i'm really digging  that guys it's really really nice so let me go for   one more bite of this i'm going to go for a little  barbarian style with the actual bowl itself but   as you can see the chicken itself they do call  this premium chicken they're nice thick cut   and they really really look pretty nice actually  they're brown from what i'm looking at here on my   side but i'm really digging the amount of them  that's in here and again the penny pasta it's   almost perfectly al dente it's not mushy not  super hard either right in the middle perfect yeah i like that the chicken is really good  on this yeah definitely pretty tasty and as   much as i'm enjoying this right now and believe  me i am the flavor is pretty nice on this guys   i don't think it's as good as the italian sausage  marinara pasta bread bowl that i reviewed not that   long ago which you're probably gonna see popping  up on your screen here right now that was pretty   insane as well because that actually had cheese  a decent amount of sausage that was a very fun   review so make sure you check that one out but  when it comes to this there's really no easy way   to do this guys so you know what i'm just gonna  have to get gangster with it take a look at that   very thick this thing is a really really big  piece of pizza crust is really what it feels   like it's a lot of pizza bread it's a lot of dough  and man this thing is hefty let's just go for a   bite real quick and give this a shot gangster  style right here and peep this out reviews   mmm oh yeah that's how you gotta do  it oh man that's awesome like that   i'm not even gonna front this is definitely  the funnest way to have this guys let me just   bring this around for you here just so you can  kind of take a look at that bite right there   that is really the way to go and  obviously a very "carby" situation here   but the doughiness and all the nice flavor that  i'm getting from the actual bread bowl itself   is pretty awesome i really have to say the flavor  is really shining through there's lots of garlic   lots of olive oil it's really drenched in it and  that really is the main highlight of this by far   so the delivery mechanism to get this into your  face is easily something you want to pick up and   have like this because like i said it's almost  like a 7-inch pan pizza practically because of   how thick in the way that it feels let's go  for another bite like this this is pretty fun oh yeah all day long this is not a bread bowl  as far as i'm concerned this is a massive garlic   knot and a very chewy one at that as well  guys i really love the bread bowl with this   just the feeling of having it the way that this is  right now with that garlic in the olive oil it's   a massive garlic knot and then you have a lot  of the "carby" goodness on the inside i'm going   to keep showing you this here guys because it's  really beautiful the chicken is amazing with it   you know what let me do that one final bite  actually with a piece of the chicken on the   bowl here i want to get that at the very end but  man a super fun way to have this and i'd easily   recommend this one to you if you guys are fans  of bread bowls in general heck if you're a fan   of garlic knots in general you're going to want to  give this one a shot because it's a lot of fun so   one more bite one more close-up and we'll  finish this one up after the rating let's do it alright so let me carefully do a 360 for you  here guys as you can see like i said earlier   it really feels like a massive garlic knot and  my hands are loaded with the garlic olive oil   goodness on this one the seasoning is amazing  on it the only thing where this really kind   of lacks is the overall flavor of that alfredo  sauce but everything else delivers on this one   and i gotta say guys just really really delicious  a super fun thing to check out right now   well looks like that piece of chicken that fell  over at the end there took one for the team right   now but you know what a huge thank you for your  service because you really helped elevate this   bread bowl to new levels because obviously  the premium chicken is pretty amazing so   sorry to lose one of you but i've got plenty in  this bowl to make up for it all right so with that   said i'm gonna have to give the chicken alfredo  pasta bread bowl here at domino's a pretty rock   solid 8.5 out of 10 like i mentioned  earlier the main improvement on this one really   needs to be in the sauce department while it is  rich and creamy it definitely needs just a little   bit more salt just to kind of bring out a little  bit more of that flavor but overall everything   else delivers and like i said the highlight is  the actual bowl itself it's a massive garlic knot   and a very tasty one at that as you guys saw  it's very dense very rich in its own flavor   and i got to admit it goes very nice on top of all  the other carbs in that just a beautiful situation   and something super fun to check out right now  okay so after i've just obviously checked this   one out right now are you going to be doing the  same pretty soon drop some comments down below   how excited are you to get one of these pasta  bread bowls a shot over here at domino's and if   you've had any of them so far
