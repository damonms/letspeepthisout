 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty sonic americas drive in is doubling up the beef and tripling the melted cheese for it's latest burger promo but whatever you do don't assume this big boy is just another golden arches knock off so let's check out the all new biggie cheese here at sonic and a given the middle bun situation squashed right there in the middle I guess I can understand why some people would think this looks like the other iconic burger found elsewhere but that's where the similarities end on this one let's pop the top and take a look underneath and see what it's packing looks like we've got some pickles we've got some bbq sauce we've got some grilled onions little bit of mayo as well we've got a slice of cheese and that's actually all along a half pound of beef here guys 2 quarter pound patties and actually this is supposed to have 3 slices of cheese it looks like I am missing a slice underneath the first patty here but there is the middle bun as you can see squashed in and then underneath that of course the other and on the very bottom of this one here that is it so it looks like I am shorted a slice of cheese although we do have the 2 patties here guys but it is what it is it's still very cheesy and it looks pretty appetizing let's give this one a shot and see how the flavor is it's the biggie cheese here at sonic let's peep out this flavor alright this is a first I'm in the middle of what they call a bomb cyclone it's a pretty big storm that's pummeling the southland right now so let's just get into this real quick but before I do and like always if you guys are fans of high quality delicious looking food reviews make sure to hit that subscribe button down below and don't forget to tap that bell icon so you can be notified as soon as brand new content drops every week here we go it's the biggie cheese minus a slice of cheese here at sonic mmm that's pretty thick mmm alright first off that middle bun is completely smashed in between the patties so I'm not really getting anything in terms of extra bread in terms of the feeling but what I am getting is a lot of thickness initially because the actual bun itself the top and bottom is pretty thick it's a brioche style bun almost like a catchers mitt the way it engulfs the whole burger and the burger itself is fairly thick guys the bbq sauce nice and tangy on that one it's got a nice hickory smokiness to it and of course the snap and crunch of the pickles as well pretty tasty so far let's keep going mmm and lemme also add the richness of that bbq sauce is really beginning to come out right now along with the cheesiness and I'm actually kind of glad there not a 3rd slice of cheese because I think the 2 slices is perfect with this one guys and as you can see pretty nice situation on the inside the burger patties while a little on the dry side do feel like they're each a quarter pound a piece and that's really a nice thing even after cooking the thickness is absolutely there and guys let's not forget about the grilled onions very lovely situation adding a little bit of extra crunch along with those pickles ya know when I initially popped this top on this one I  initially thought there wasn't as much bbq sauce as I would've liked but as I'm getting into this further there actually is a very decent amount and it's mixing very nicely with the mayo which is not really a favorite of mine but the nice tang and sweetness of that hickory smoked bbq sauce is doing a nice job of covering up whatever mayo is there but guys still very tasty and I have to admit again I'm glad I don't have that 3rd slice of cheese on this because I think it's just perfect the way that it is let's go for one more bite and we'll wrap this one up after the rating and yes I'm still digging the pickles so let's do a little 360 action to round out this closeup and like said early dry patties aside I'm really digging that fact that the flavor is shining through on this one it's definitely a tall burger which is kind of nice even though it looks kind of small when you open it up it's got some thickness there's plenty of bbq sauce there and I have to admit the combination with the grilled onions and those pickles is a very nice touch again that 3rd slice of cheese missing is OK with me because I'm really digging the overall quality of what this has and I really thick it's perfect the way that it is with the 2 and 2 the 2 patties the 2 slices of cheese definitely give this one a shot guys it's easily my favorite sonic burger so far and hey that's saying a lot because generally sonic is a little hit or miss with me depending on what I'm reviewing usually there's something missing something I think they can do better and there usually is with just about anything you review but more often than not there's usually something that sticks out and in this case it's the dryness of the patties themselves I wish they were just a little bit fresher and aside from the cheese slice being missing believe it or not it actually helped this burger at least in my opinion so with that said I'm gonna have to give the biggie cheese all new here at sonic a very solid 8.8 out of 10 and I gotta admit guys like I said earlier it really is my favorite sonic burger to date I really just hope they can get the dryness taken care of on that one and honestly maybe keep this one around a little bit longer and now that I think about it why not add some bacon to the mix I mean it's bbq cheeseburger technically how amazing would bacon be on something like that considering there's a comparable burger out right now that's literally $2.50 more expensive than this this is something that definitely needs to be addressed sonic I highly recommend you give that a go but of course the obvious question is are you gonna give this one a go drop some comments down below lemme know if you're gonna be giving the biggie cheese a very appropriately named burger a shot over here at sonic and while we're at it how many slices of cheese is too much whenever you get a burger Is 3 the perfect amount is 2 the perfect amount or do you like more drop those comments down below and definitely lemme know and with that this is Ian K closing out another episode of peep this out bringing you brand new content every single week here on my channel so while you
