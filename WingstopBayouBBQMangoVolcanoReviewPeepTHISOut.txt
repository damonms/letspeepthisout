 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty so after checking out the first two flavors as part of wingstop's 25th anniversary promo it looks like a bunch of you wanted me to go in on the next round and as you can already tell by the title to this one we're going in on the Bayou BBQ and the mango volcano as the two new remix flavors to check out as part of that 25th anniversary promo looking very sauced up very nice-looking indeed and you know it's also nice the fact that I got all of this for six bucks they had a 60 cent per wing promo right now so this 10-piece was only six dollars plus tax along with a little side of ranch extra about eighty nine cents there but guys looking really really nice starting off with the Bayou bbq here we've got a combination of hickory smoked barbecue sauce and cajun seasoning and they look really really nice that cajun seasoning is all over the very top as for the mango volcano looking very very saucy there as well almost like a Hawaiian theme and incidentally we've got a signature habanero flavor with fruitiness mixed in with this one along with sweet Hawaiian so very curious to see what this one's all about here and if it's gonna deliver the heat compared to the dragon's breath that I tried the last time out but guys they both look kind of threatening I got to admit maybe this one more so here considering the cajun spices but looking very nice indeed it's the two latest promo flavors here at wingstop let's peep out this flavor so are you a fan of high-quality delicious looking food reviews well if so definitely

degree situation outside of my car right now which means the inside here is pretty much like a sauna even with my windows cracked and I'm getting into two flavors that are potentially gonna be crazier than what it is outside to begin with let's give it a shot guys it's the BBQ first and I'm definitely going into that one because this volcano one already has a threatening name let's just give this one a shot first barbecue sauce is subtle on this one almost like a Hickory type flavor that's coming to you more then the actual spice but here it comes it's a light though it's like a light sizzle it's not really popping crazy it's more of the barbecue I like it though take a look at that boneless wing aka the glorified nugget a little bit on the dry side just like the last time out guys with that white meat chicken but I have to admit the coating is really making up for that along with the sauciness of the barbecue itself the Cajun spice thing is decent but it's nothing crazy in terms of heat but I'm definitely diggin the flavor of this one it is pretty rich and I like the fact that you can really see the seasoning on this as well I mean it's peppered pretty nicely on the top and they're very generous with the amount of that on top of the barbecue sauce let's go for one more bite of this one and then we're definitely getting into some ranch I think that combo is gonna be pretty nice too mm-mmm very nice and speaking of nice so is the amount of ranch they actually give you her wingstop guys nice and creamy and you got to love that contrast with the barbecue sauce let's hit it barbecue and ranch happens to be a pretty tasty combo in general so I think I know what to expect with this one mmm deliciousness all around that's what it is of course it cools it off nicely the nice hickory smoke of the barbecue sauce and the creaminess of that ranch and the light spicing from the Cajun seasoning not bad all right let's see what's up with that mango volcano because the name alone is already making me sweat aside from the temperature in my car right now you know this is a pretty nice-looking nugget lathered up very nicely in that mango volcano sauce that combination of the mango habanero which you can actually see a seat or two from there along with some sweet Hawaiian goodness coming my way I think let's dive into it it may not be as dark and threatening as the Bayou barbecue but I have a feeling with habanero in the name I'm in for it let's do it sweet Hawaiian almost like a pineapple type feel Oh it comes that habanero you cuttin' me off quick oh man that is heated it's not dragons breath fire quality but that sizzle is just moving along I'm just humming along right now already Wow my lips are sizzling very nicely this definitely is less than the atomic but very very nicely elevated compared to the Cajun spice something on the barbecue Bayou they're really really tasty stuff though man it's just this is good mmm I like this one better all right let's bust off into the ranch with one of these mangle volcano boneless wings to try and bring down that heat level just a bit all right here we go with little Cool Ranch action trying to bring down the heat from this mango volcano looking really really nice you got to love that contrast of color really really awesome stuff here let's dive in just about anything in ranch is awesome if you ask me here we go mmm and this is no exception wow I really love the sweetness about Hawaiian coming through and the heat of the habanero even though it's not quite up there with the atomic and the dragon's breath in general this is actually a really tasty wing more flavorful than the barbecue Bayou I have to admit guys it really is a better type of flavor at least for me and I love the contrast of sweet and heat with almost like a mango pineappley type of flavor it's really good though it really is mmm so let's finish this one out with a contrasting look of both of these on the same fork and as you guys can see here the spicing and the seasoning on that Bayou barbecue is actually a really nice situation guys I have to admit I love the way it looks it really is a nice accent to a really really nice Hickory flavored wing with a little bit of spice but that mango volcano is definitely gonna be the favorite there the mango habanero sauce along with just a sweet Hawaiian in general is a really nice situation for little hints of like mango and pineapple with a really nice amount of heat so depending upon what you're into these are actually really both great flavors to check out for sure but if you want my opinion that mango volcano is definitely tops so let's get into the ratings on these for the Bayou barbecue that one's gonna get a rock-solid 8.5 out of 10 everything you heard me just say right now pretty much summed it up I mean I love the quality of the Hickory barbecue sauce they're using with this one and the Cajun spicing definitely makes for one tasty wing when they're all combined together it's really good but as you already know that mango volcano is gonna take the top spot between these two flavors with a rock-solid 9 out of 10 and the only thing holding this one back from a 10 out of 10 is like I mentioned from the last review unfortunately the meat is just a little on the dry side but the sauces do make up for it but I think a little bit more tenderness on the inside would have gone a long way but still guys very flavorful I love the fruity theme that it's got going with it that pineapple mango type of sauce and the heat of that habanero it's mixed with was primo it's really really my favorite out of the two but of course now the question is that of these two that I'm checking out right now which is gonna be your favorite drop some
