 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty hey everyone welcome back to another high quality  foodie feature for you here on the channel   cheaters cam style after hours over at the habit  because like everybody else these days they're   jumping into the fast food chicken sandwich wars  and while their entry does appear a little bit   more traditional it still looks pretty tasty  so let's go in on their own crispy chicken   sandwich and as you can see it's looking fairly  crispy on that chicken patty but starting us off   on the very top we've got their standard plain  bun that they use for their regular charburgers   let's pop it and take a look underneath that is  a very nice looking piece of chicken guys what   you're looking at here is supposed to be a juicy  double breaded chicken fillet and i gotta say it   is sizable looking pretty nice underneath it we've  got the standard components here lettuce tomato   and underneath that we've got some mayo and  some pickles a decent amount actually there   guys this is looking pretty good but again the  crispiness of that chicken patty looks pretty   awesome so let's not waste any more time on this  one let's see if the flavor is going to deliver   it's their all-new crispy chicken sandwich here at  the habit let's peep out this flavor well i gotta   say out of all the competitive chicken sandwiches  that i've done here on the channel since popeyes   this is looking pretty tasty right now and the  fact that it's supposed to be double breaded on   the chicken fillet it is definitely that you can  easily see that this is looking pretty nice guys   i have to admit the thickness is not bad on this  my only gripe and you can probably tell on the   very top is that there is nothing kind of holding  it on the very top with that bun there my guess   is this was probably made upside down as you can  see the mayo on the bottom with the lettuce and   the tomato and the pickles but even still a very  lovely situation in the presentation department   all right so let's get into this one because the  fried aroma in my car right now is lighting up   beautifully so here we go it's the crispy chicken  sandwich brand new here at the habit let's do it mmm crunchy oh yeah right away i didn't get too  much chicken with that but what i did   get was instantly flavorful the coating on  this is pretty amazing the pickle snap that   i got also is pretty awesome as well let me  just give you a quick look at it here guys   this is very very flavorful the breading  is really the highlight on this so far   supposedly seasoned with all kinds of like nice  spicing but all i'm getting is a lot of fried   goodness up front and i'm really digging  that let's go in again this is pretty tasty mmm well i'm definitely glad i got the chicken  sandwich diaper on the back of this one because   this one is leaking big time the mayo is  beginning to melt and that pickle juice is   also falling out the back but guys the flavors are  on point with this the crispiness of that chicken   is amazing as i'm getting further in it's not  ultra thick but it is crazy wide so it's covering   the whole bun very nicely and i have to admit the  overall flavor of the breading is awesome on this   all right hopefully that focus stayed locked in on  the breading of the chicken itself because i got   to say again that is the major highlight of this  so far everything else is pretty much standard   the crunchiness of the pickles are pretty  amazing as they are in chicken sandwiches   but it's really the key in terms of the breading  to really light this one up that's a distinct   feature with this i kind of wish this had like  a brioche style bun as you can see it's just   a standard hamburger bun on here so this is  really kind of a lackluster add-on for this   it should have been a nice little shiny  bun if anything there if anything this   is kind of reminding me of the golden  chicken sandwich that i did way back when   although that flavor is completely different it  was still a pretty thick chicken sandwich as well   take a look at that review popping up on your  screen right now that's definitely one you want   to check out if you want to see their original  chicken sandwich technically it is the original   chicken sandwich but for this new version an  easy awesomeness in terms of the recipe that   they're using here guys this is beautiful  let's keep going in definitely digging it and it's crunchy i love that yeah this is  definitely beautifully made guys the size of   the chicken alone is worth the price of admission  on this one granted is a little on the high side   but it really is a nice piece of chicken you  can really see the spices on the breading itself   and it's a huge piece of chicken as you can  see and again on the bottom the traditional   components of a regular chicken sandwich here  in this case it's going to be just the lettuce   the tomato the pickles and that mayo but a  decent amount of each and i have to admit   they really do add to the overall flavor of this  oh and did i mention i'm super glad i've got a   chicken sandwich diaper right now there's a lot  of juice flying off this guys i'm not sure where   it's coming from aside from the pickles but  there's a lot dripping off of this at one time   i got to be careful here and i'm glad i've  got this little tray action this is kind of   a dangerous sandwich at night right now but guys  a beautiful situation and again very tasty let   me go for one more bite and we're going to close  this one out after the rating but as you can tell   very well done on this one even if the price  is a little on the high side let's do it mmm alright so i'm going to hold this chicken  sandwich right here because one wrong move and   i'm going to spill out the back here guys there's  a lot hanging over here but as you can see   very nicely done and again the chicken is done  very well this is distinctly different from that   golden chicken back in the day and i have to  admit i am digging the double coated breading   on this that is a huge highlight very juicy  the white meat is beautiful on it and again   even though the price point's a little on the  higher side this is a very well distinctly made   chicken sandwich compared to the other ones out  there and i'm really really digging it very solid   chicken juice pickle juice and a little bit of  mayo mixed together is really what's lighting   up this one big time and you really like i said  need a bunch of napkins to keep that one together   if not the chicken sandwich diaper that's all  i'm gonna say on it all right so with that   said i'm gonna have to give the crispy chicken  sandwich here at the habit a pretty rock solid   8 out of 10 and i wish i can rate it higher  than that because the components were beautifully   made like i said the flavor was amazing on it  but $7.50 is a lot to ask for what that is i know   the chicken like i said earlier is worth the  price of admission and it is but at $7.50 that's   about three dollars more than what you can get  comparably elsewhere and i gotta be honest guys   as delicious as that is it's no substitute for a  four dollar chicken sandwich that's lighting up the   menus right now across the country elsewhere  and i think you know what i'm talking about   but at the same time it's distinctly different  especially for the habit and it really does fit   with their product line because naturally  it's more club-like but without the bacon   but still a beautiful piece of chicken nonetheless  so an easy recommendation to try and it may just   hook you but for $7.50 like i said it's a little  on the pricey side just a little bit all right   so now the all-important question if you've got  a habit in the area are you willing to spend $7.50   to give this one a shot did this one look pretty  amazing to you right now drop some comments down   below let me know what your thoughts are on this  particular chicken sandwich and what your favorite   chicken sandwich is so far that you've seen here  on the channel drop those comments down below and   definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K  closing out another high quality foodie feature   for you here on peep this out reviews cheaters cam  style after hours
