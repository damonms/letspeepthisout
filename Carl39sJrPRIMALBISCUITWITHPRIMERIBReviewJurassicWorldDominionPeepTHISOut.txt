 what's going on everyone and welcome or  welcome back to the channel it's Ian K   where today i'm over at carl's jr at the break  of dawn to finish out my quadrilogy of reviews   on their all-new primal hunger menu that's right  and you already know so stay tuned because the   primal biscuit with prime rib is up next welcome  to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty i don't know i think i might have saved the best  for last with this one guys because the aroma   in my car right now is heavenly on top of this it's  looking pretty awesome and speaking of which take   a look at it it's the primal biscuit with prime  rib and i gotta say guys a very lovely situation   of meaty goodness along with some eggy goodness to  go with that biscuit let's break this one on down   real quick so here we go with some flavor lit by  fire early in the a.m and i gotta say this primal   biscuit with prime rib is looking pretty banging  guys that biscuit is looking really nice let's   pop it and take a look underneath and you're going  to see there's no shortage of that amber barbecue   sauce basically the carolina barbecue sauce adding  a little bit of tang a little bit of zip to this   one it's definitely looking pretty awesome and  as we pan down a whole fried egg and plenty more   of that amber barbecue sauce to go with as well  guys i'm really liking that underneath it is one   of the main stars of the show of course the sliced  prime rib action a fairly decent amount along with   a slice of smoked cheddar cheese to go with guys  and i have to say overall i think that's going to   be the wild card with everything on this one but  guys a decent amount of that prime rib i'm really   digging the presentation so far and i gotta say i  am very excited to get into this one here plenty   of goodness all around all right so let's not  waste any more time on this one let's get into   it this is the all-new primal biscuit with prime  rib celebrating the release of jurassic world   dominion here at carl's jr let's peep out this  flavor well as most of you know i'm not really a   breakfast person so to get up in the morning it's  going to take just a little bit guys but if it's   going to look as good as this whatever i'm going  to be reviewing let's just say i am very excited   to give this a go outside of wanting to check out  the new jurassic world dominion film let's give   this a go finally it's the primal biscuit with  prime rib here at carl's jr let's peep this out right away going into that right off the  break going into that first bite guys the   butteriness of the biscuit and the tang of that  amber barbecue sauce was beautiful right then   and there let me just show you this real  quick here i got a little bit of the prime   rib it's fairly tender as well and a little  bit of the egg but guys so far i am totally   digging the flavor profile with this one this  absolutely screams breakfast in the morning and   again that amber barbecue sauce is banging  let's keep going in guys very tasty on this wow add in the smokiness of that cheddar  cheese which comes through very strong with   this one and you've got a pretty awesome  flavor profile for breakfast guys this   pretty much smokes the primal burrito and  i gotta say this is really really awesome   definitely an awesome flavor combination  with that sliced prime rib on the bottom   and of course with the fried egg that smoky  cheddar cheese that is definitely a banging   situation on top of that amber barbecue sauce  really delicious stuff on this yeah there's a   particular reason why i saved this one for the  very end guys i had a feeling this was going   to come up pretty strong and it definitely does  now don't get me wrong the rest of the menu is   pretty awesome over here including the primal  angus thick burger a very lovely situation   with that one followed up with the primal  burrito with prime rib along with that beyond   wraptor burger guys definitely some beautiful stuff  they're popping up on your screen here right now   but i gotta say this right now guys the biscuit  action the wild card with that amber barbecue   sauce and the smokiness of that cheddar goes  amazing with the fried egg on this this is truly   delicious stuff let's go for another couple of  bites on this guys definitely a banging situation you know i'm not really minding the fact that the  biscuit's a little bit more on the crumblier side   than i've had it over here at carl's jr because  everything is being held together primarily with   the cheese and i think that's one of the main  reasons that it's there i guess the glue to kind   of help everything in there along with the fried  egg guys this is really kind of holding its own   and as i'm squeezing into it it's still kind  of holding its own here which is kind of nice   but guys very very flavorful across the  board with this and again the wild card   of that amber barbecue sauce the light tang  and zip that i'm getting from it a little   bit of the mesquite flavor it's got a really  nice light sweeter flavor to it as well and it   goes so amazing with the sliced prime rib and  of course the fried egg just everything about   this is super flavorful especially for a  breakfast biscuit this is pretty banging   all right so let's go for one more bite of this  one before we close the review out with the rating   coming up next but guys putting the capper on the  quadrilogy of the reviews that i've done over here   at carl's jr with this is a beautiful situation  all around truly delicious for breakfast and even   if you're not a morning person like i am right now  this is easily worth your time to get up and give   a go because it really is awesome with that amber  barbecue sauce and the buttery biscuit along with   everything else in this guys really delicious  stuff one more bite and we'll close it out hang on yes sir buttery buttermilk action mixed in with  some smoky cheddar cheese and of course that fried   egg is already breakfast right then and there  but once you add in that prime rib action and   the amber barbecue sauce you've got a beautiful  situation the smoky cheddar cheese is definitely   a standout with this on top of the overall  amber barbecue sauce in general but guys very   hearty on this one and i gotta say delicious stuff  really really worth checking out absolutely yummy   yes sir pretty tasty on that one guys and i gotta  say just a little reminiscent from the previous   version that i reviewed a couple of years ago  which was the prime rib and fried egg biscuit   that was pretty much the exact same thing minus  the smoky cheddar cheese and of course the amber   barbecue sauce but guys a very lovely situation  because of what that adds to the overall profile   of everything that this one has got the  amber barbecue sauce on that fried egg   goes amazing together naturally with the  smoky cheddar cheese doing that as well   everything about it just screams deliciousness  guys it really works pretty well on top of that   buttery buttermilk biscuit it's definitely pretty  nice so with that said i'm gonna have to give   the primal biscuit with prime rib celebrating  the release of jurassic world dominion here at   carl's jr a pretty awesome 9 out of 10 guys very  delicious across the board with that if there's   one thing that kind of hurts it as usually is  the case with some of these promos is the price   point in just over six bucks it's a little on the  pricey side but what you're going to get is still   a very flavorful breakfast sandwich and like i  said the combination of all those ingredients   works so primo along with the smokiness of that  cheddar cheese which is nice and vibrant nice   and strong to go with the amber barbecue  sauce the combination works extremely well   easily worth your time and like i said if you're  not a breakfast person it's worth getting up to   try at least once pretty tasty all right question  time and i've got just one for you outside of   the usual if you're going to be giving this one a  shot naturally do me a quick favor let me
