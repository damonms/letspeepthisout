all right bye-bye all right guys so after almost an hour in line let's peep this out well it's one love after hours here at raising canes as we go in on their sandwich combo and i gotta say i am already digging the look at this one guys it's simple and what it is just some crinkle cut fries and their chicken finger sandwich here but that kaiser roll is already setting it off let's take a look underneath it looks like we've got some of their famous cane's sauce and three of their chicken fingers here very meaty very crispy very fried looking nice and thick and underneath that let me see if i can lift this further for you looks like just some lettuce and more of that cane's sauce but man these chicken fingers have some heft just by lifting that one up there very meaty a lovely situation indeed so let's not waste any more time on this one it's the chicken finger sandwich as part of their sandwich combo here at raising canes let's peep out this flavor well this was definitely an experience filming this one tonight guys but don't get me wrong i definitely had a blast filming the first part of this review and judging by the line of people that were lined up for this place naturally raising canes is legendary they were definitely pushing that one love action and i gotta say guys i'm already impressed with the size of this sandwich right now feast your eyes on that massive chicken tenders on the inside of a kaiser roll with some lettuce you can't even see the lettuce it's so small but with that cane's sauce on top of it so a lovely situation and i gotta say i'm a huge fan of chicken tenders most of you guys know that although ranch is my thing i'm definitely excited to go in on the sandwich version of technically the three finger combo just with the addition of extra carbs but i got to say guys again very impressive so let's go in on this one it's the chicken finger sandwich part of the regular sandwich combo here at raising canes let's do it worth the wait wow first of all the breading on this absolutely smokes the chicken strips that i reviewed over at chick-fil-a recently which i believe that review is probably up right now on the channel but guys this is super super delicious let me go for one more bite of this i'm gonna give you a cross-section shot very delicious so far guys very delicious oh yeah this is how you do chicken fingers this is absolutely an insane situation right now that cane's sauce is adding a little bit of that familiar thousand island zip to it if i can call it that it's got a little bit of spice nothing too crazy but the flavor is definitely nice on it and the coating i haven't even gotten into the third strip right over here at the end as you can see very meaty that white meat is really awesome super fresh nice and warm and again the coating guys i am digging the crispiness of this it's not overly oily it's not overly fried but it's got just the right amount of crunch and the kaiser roll is a nice touch on this one here really is and you know what that really says something because kaiser rolls are not really my go-to i mean naturally they do feel like they're kind of dusted with flour on top they feel a little bit more firmer but of course the softness that they deliver on top of everything else with this the crunchiness of the chicken it's very simple again just to show you it is really just those chicken fingers with the cane's sauce let me get that focused in for you naturally there with the lettuce on the very bottom for a little extra crunch it really doesn't even need to be there because of all the crazy delicious tender action that i'm in the middle of here right now let's just keep going with this so guys this is really really good really good i totally see why the line was around the block for this i mean the lines rival in n out locally where i live and i gotta say i was really surprised i mean it's just chicken tenders right for those of you guys who are fans of raising canes drop some comments down below let me know if this is actually your go-to spot for these because this is easily worth the time even in the middle of the day if i go back there i'm gonna probably be getting this one again it's a delicious sandwich and the value is not bad for what i paid for this even though with the crinkle cut fries it is what it is they're not really my go-to either but you know what since we're just talking about that quickly here right now let me just show you one real fast i'll just go for one really quick just to try it here they're orida they're orida not bad this is the real deal though guys so let me go for one more bite of this one we'll finish this one up after the rating but guys a delicious situation you already know what it is the white meat is amazing on this the coating is really nice like i said not overly fried nice and crispy and that kaiser roll again really setting this off because of the powdery goodness that solid feel that it has on the top here on top of it being just nice and soft and again just a lovely situation with all of that white meat this is a serious serious treat right now even after hours highly worth your time i think you know that if you're fans of this place let's go for another bite and we'll finish this one out all right so let me do a 360 on this one here guys very carefully because i'm coming to the end of one of those strips and i don't want it to fall but i'm loving the situation here the meatiness of them easily make this worth your time it's easily worth your time in general anyway because of what it is i think but as you can see a lovely situation and i'm barely holding this one together very solid guys but i think you know that by now right you know i was really hoping that was going to be pretty awesome and thankfully after trying the three-finger combo a while back which you guys can obviously find in the upper right-hand corner of your display right now if you haven't seen that review already as mentioned previously this is definitely a step in the right direction because adding that extra carb really set it off for me so i'm not sure what i gave actually that review when i did it last time with the three finger combo but when it comes to this in sandwich form and how thick that was how juicy it was it wasn't dry it was very very delicious i can easily see this one's gonna be definitely tops compared to what i had originally so with that said i'm gonna have to give the chicken finger sandwich as part of the regular sandwich combi here at raising canes a rock solid 9.5 out of 10 and the only reason it's not a 10 out of 10 is because that needs to be in full patty form raising canes if you're watching this right now i know you specialize in chicken fingers that's the main thing for you but this needs to be a nice solid piece of meat to really dive into right there i think that would be a primo addition to your product line and given the popularity of chicken sandwiches lately i think it's about time you put this one on there permanently still very delicious and easily worth your time it virtually is a 10 out of 10 right i mean come on okay now the obvious question is do you think this one is a 10 out of 10 drop some comments down below if you've had this in the past because it's been around for a while this is brand new for me up in my area anyway what did you personally think of it is it your go-to chicken sandwich drop those comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K closing out another
