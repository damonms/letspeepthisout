a Big Kahuna sandwich just the sandwich by itself and that's it you got it great thanks so much Arby's we have the meats for sandwiches hey good man how you doing yeah Big Kahuna time I can't wait awesome and I gotta do some horsey sauce too please perfect no three is good thanks man good to see 'ya again thanks we'll see 'ya stay frosty alright guys let's peep this out King's Hawaiian makes its triumphant return to Arby's and we're going in on the Big Kahuna to see what that awesome name-brand bun can do to all that good stuff there in the middle guys as always Arby's is looking very appetizing here let's pop the top and see what we've got underneath it looks like starting off we have got some of that spicy pineapple habanero which is new for arby's here definitely looking to getting into that we've got some Swiss cheese it looks like plenty of that 13 hour marinated brisket right there as well as some pit smoked ham and see if I can lift it up just a little bit for you here oh yeah guys take a look at that delicious brisket action right there more actually brisket than ham and I'm actually okay with that so very very delicious stuff that's all sitting on top of a 100% white meat crispy chicken fillet nice and crispy indeed and underneath that let's lift it up we have some tomato we have a little bit of lettuce and more of that spicy pineapple habanero sauce so this is definitely looking like a very saucy situation but a meaty one at that and again the brisket is always the bomb here at Arby's I love reviewing it it really looks fantastic and for 13 hours marinated plus it definitely looks the part guys that really really looks good smells pretty fantastic looks pretty fantastic and again can't wait to try this spicy pineapple habanero looking really really nice there as well guys this is the King's Hawaiian Big Kahuna here at Arby's let's peep out this flavor you know with a couple of more meats we could have easily had ourselves here at King's Hawaiian 5 mega meat stack but even still this looks pretty awesome let's dive in it's the King's Hawaiian Big Kahuna here at Arby's mmm oh man that is tasty and it's got a nice amount of heat that's beginning to come up on me right now kind of a steamy type of heat it's not like a burn burn heat but I got to say the sweetness of that pineapple with it is pretty awesome guys tenderness of that brisket is always on point the juiciness of the chicken you can tell this was definitely made fresh let's keep going I'm diggin it already mmm oh man that is the bomb it's a total meat fest with that Swiss cheese trying to hold everything together which I believe is the point of it being there guys like I always say with these types of sandwiches the cheese is the glue to bring it all together I'm not really tasting the Swiss too much at all but that pineapple habanero is absolutely delicious with this goes amazingly well with that smoked brisket and of course the ham and then you get into the nice crispiness of that chicken patty on the very bottom guys and then you have even more of that spicy habanero sauce this is definitely a treat the surfs up big time with this guys in the flavor department for sure really really delicious stuff yeah that brisket is always amazing I love checking out the sandwiches here at Arby's that have it and it really is a signature meat on top of their regular roast beef and guys it goes amazingly well with that spicy habanero it's just a delicious flavor a light sweetness a little bit of heat and you're getting that marinated deliciousness from the brisket itself it's really awesome mmm really really good let's dive in again shall we mmm man it's an absolute party eating this right now this is so freakin good you know now that I think about it I'm kind of glad this is the amount of meat that's on this version of a sandwich right now and it wasn't anything more than three because three is a lot to begin with because you can really taste the nice flavors of the three separate meats themselves and that spicy habanero sauce together it's a nice combination and again the Swiss cheese I think is there for more advertising I'm not really tasting the cheese at all on this but how could you with all the meat and the light sweetness that I'm getting from that spicy habanero sauce as well guys it's just really really good easy recommendation very hearty for your appetite if you're down with something like this and how could you not be guys it's Arby's they have the meats right for sandwiches mmm yeah as tasty as this is as is you know what it's time for right we have to absolutely lace this up with some horsey sauce let's do it yesir this wouldn't be Arby's without some of this good stuff right over here we are most definitely diving into this and I've got it all concentrated right here in the middle with plenty of that spicy habanero sauce leaking out the very back I'm so glad I have this little burger diaper here right now here we go mmm Wow guys the extra heat that I'm getting from the horsey sauce on top of the spicy pineapple habanero is a primo combination you have got to combine those two together because it adds just a little extra layer of bite to what you're already getting from the habanero sauce in general that is really good and of course it goes very nicely with the meats themselves here at Arby's horsey sauce always does but you know what I got to do that one more time because that is just redonkulous hang on one second here little bit just right over here on the edge because I really want to get this one more time and go in on it and guys it's just an excuse to go for it again right let's do it mmm man yeah that is completely off the chain that horsey sauce not only takes up my fan favorite smoked brisket very nicely it really adds a nice little extra layer a bite like I was saying to the overall sandwich and guys you got to have horsey sauce whenever you come the Arby's you just gotta and last but not least let's not forget about that awesome King's Hawaiian bread which they use usually once or twice a year here at Arby's and it really goes amazingly well with this not only is it very fresh and very soft and of course it has the light sweetness on its own but the main star of the show with this one is easily going to be that spicy pineapple habanero that is really the highlight on top of the brisket for me and I have to admit with the ham and with that juicy chicken the crispness of it guys this is just a delicious sandwich if you've got the appetite give this one a go it is definitely bomb like I said you know I can't really remember the last time I actually reviewed something here at Arby's that had a little bit of the heat that I'm experiencing right now it's actually still leaving a nice feeling in my mouth and it really is a very very nice flavor it's a beautiful sauce and I really hope they use it on some other stuff coming out in the future but guys very delicious on the Big Kahuna and of course with a name like Big Kahuna it's got plenty of meat even though it is too short of the 5 mega meat stack which you guys can take a look at my review of here in the upper right hand corner for display that was pretty awesome as well but as it stands with this one I love the theme the surf is definitely up I know I'm beating that one to death but I absolutely love saying it and it's warranted I think only because of the ham and the sweetness and the King's Hawaiian bread naturally so guy is very delicious on this one so as if you really need me to give you a rating on this one because I think you know what I'm gonna give it I'm gonna have to give the King's Hawaiian Big Kahuna here at Arby's a rock-solid 10 out of 10 very satisfying very hearty and those three meats really do highlight it nicely on top of really the star of the show at least in my opinion that spicy pineapple habanero just primo stuff but the obvious question to me anyway at least based upon my review is did any of this look primo to you drop some comments down below are you gonna be giving any of these King's Hawaiian sandwiches a shot over here at Arby's and are you a fan of King's Hawaiian bread in general drop those comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K closing out another episode of peep this out bringing you brand new content every single week here on my channel so while you stay tuned for that next review coming real soon in the meantime stay frosty hey can we just keep this King's Hawaiian bread on the menu year-round it is just so freakin tasty alright guys until next time I'll talk to you soon
