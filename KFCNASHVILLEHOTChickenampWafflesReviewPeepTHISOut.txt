Butterworth's original syrup to go with that as well as a buttery spread so that's gonna top it off nicely but overall I got to say the aroma is lovely guys Nashville hot is lighting up the car beautifully and I'm thinking the flavor is gonna be pretty awesome on this so let's find out shall we it's the Nashville hot chicken and waffles here at KFC let's peep out this flavor alright before we get started do me a quick favor drop a comment down below let me know if you agree with me when I tell you that Nashville hot is the most popular flavor of chicken here at KFC outside of their normal recipe I mean it really was the first flavor of the South's sauce they had regularly on the menu when it debuted a couple of years ago so let me know if you actually agree with that and as

little bit of syrup on the waffle itself this is looking and smelling really really tasty here already and I'm actually gonna go into this one completely with my hands so I'm not gonna use a spork nothing like that we're just gonna have fun with this right now so let me give this waffle a shot there's Nashville hot goodness all throughout the side of this here it's an oil-based sauce so it's really soaking into this waffle here guys and I've got some syrup and that butter spread let's give it a shot real quick first mmm thick and sweet with some heat that's pretty nice mmm the buttery spread is adding to it as well that's really tasty well this is definitely messy to eat in the car this way guys but I've got plenty of protection under the camera right now but as you can see there is lots of tasty goodness on the top of this belgian-style waffle guys the thickness is awesome the sweetness is just like I remember from the first time out and the quality is really really good as you can see right there thickness on point Nashville hot heat is really adding to it and of course the buttery spread and the maple syrup in there very lovely situation but again it's definitely very messy so make sure you've got plenty of napkins in your car if you're gonna be doing it this way with your bare hands you're gonna really thank me for it and I think you know that by now you want to have napkins anyway let me go for a piece of this chicken real quick I'm gonna pick up the leg again I have reviewed the Nashville hot chicken in the past take a look at that playlist popping up on your screen right now it's got all the details found there so let me go for a quick bite of this and then we're gonna combine them together I'm looking forward to that here we go mmm-hmmm extra crispy goodness that's tasty well I'm not a super fan of oil-based sauces like this the flavor is really tasty and he is beginning to kind of pick up as well the extra crispy coating on the outside really soaks that up beautifully as well and it's really a nice showcase of the overall flavor with the famous chicken here at the Colonel really good it's meaty it's heated and definitely the bone-in version of this chicken is the way to go to really experience it fully guys you can tell by the coating on the outside it's definitely lit up the extra crispy goodness is really solid with this and overall the flavor is just like you remember if you've had Nashville out here at KFC really really tasty alright so since I've got no fork let me go for a quick bite of the chicken a quick bite of that waffle and see how they are together here we go mmm yes the sweetness of the waffle is actually the accent to this whole meal right now guys because the heat from Nashville is obviously taking center stage along with the crispness of the chicken but that combination of the sweetness the buttery spread and the maple syrup lovely it's sweet its savory it's got a decent amount of heat thanks to the Nashville hot that's drizzled all throughout this right now and the fact that it's soaked into that waffle on top of it with the maple syrup adding a little extra sweetness on top of that and everything together very delicious guys nice combination it really is all right let me top off this waffle with a little piece of that chicken for that final close-up and then we'll wrap this one up and give it a rating hang on well I think the third time's a charm with the returning chicken and waffles here at KFC the fact that they're adding Nashville hot to it is really a no-brainer and I have to admit the flavor combination works extremely well for you fans of Nashville hot in general you have a lot to look forward to already but if you really enjoy the chicken and waffles in general here at KFC you're really gonna like this added heat it's pretty tasty so the chicken and waffles are as tasty as ever over here at KFC guys the nice combination of the sweetness of the waffle and the plump juiciness and the crispiness of the chicken is a really beautiful combination in general add in the sweetness that it adds to that in general is well on top of the heat and guys it's a no-brainer very very tasty overall so with that said I'm gonna have to give the Nashville hot chicken and waffles here at KFC a rock-solid 9.5 out of 10 it virtually is a 10 overall but like I mentioned earlier the oil base for me is not necessarily my favorite but the flavor is amazing across the board definitely a very messy thing so make sure you have some napkins like I mentioned but an easy recommendation guys definitely give this one a shot now of course the question is are you gonna give it a shot drop some comments down below let me know if you're gonna give this one a go considering this is like the third or fourth time this has been back here at KFC so for the two of you who haven't tried it by this point is nashville hot gonna be the deciding factor to give it a go
