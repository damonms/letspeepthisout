cheese burrito only this time with double  the steak that's right and i'm getting heated   with it too so stay tuned because the spicy  double steak grilled cheese burrito is up next   welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty so here we go with the returning grilled cheese  burrito and in this case it's the double steak   variant as you can tell by the very top of this  one we're actually going spicy with a few of those   jalapenos thrown in for good measure all right  so going down the line with this laundry list of   ingredients what we've got here is an oversized  flour tortilla filled with a double portion of   marinated steak seasoned rice chipotle sauce red  tortilla strips nacho cheese sauce a three cheese   blend and reduced fat sour cream and as you guys  can see on the very outside of it another layer of   cheese along with some jalapenos to give it that  spicy kick i gotta say guys this thing definitely   has some heft to it it really looks like it's  pretty solid and at almost six dollars now for   this one you'd expect it to be a little bit more  substantial this is looking pretty good all right   so let's see if i can confirm the tastiness with  this one as well as the added heat it's supposed   to have this is the all new spicy double steak  grilled cheese burrito here at taco bell let's   peep out this flavor all right guys we're outside  for this one today just in case the chipotle sauce   and the jalapenos are going to add that added  flare i figured you know what let me have a   little bit of coolness around me at the same time  but guys a very lovely situation here with this   take a look at that on the inside it is definitely  stacked of course but the main draw is going to be   that cheesy goodness on the outside along with  those jalapenos definitely a banging situation   guys lots of plentiful ingredients on the inside  and i'm definitely getting into this right now   here we go it's the spicy double steak grilled  cheese burrito here at taco bell let's do it oh man comfort food on blast wow well i gotta  say already this is already feeling like a double   portion of steak i got a nice mouthful with  that one guys along with a decent amount of   the chipotle sauce that steaminess is beginning  to pick up just a little bit it's not too bad   but it's definitely a little bit more elevated but  guys take a look at that on the inside and again   the outside goodness of that cheesy action is  amazing i got a little bit of that jalapeno   action right there as well and i gotta say  this is a banging variant so it's already   a comfort food classic i think over here at  taco bell let's keep going in it's pretty good oh yeah come on the sour cream and the beef and  all the cheesy goodness on the inside go pretty   amazing with this one guys and again the chipotle  sauce is lighting it up beautifully as well   and i'm really digging the fact that the  accent of the cheese on the outside of this   is taking this to a whole new dimension in  flavor and of course the heated goodness   with those jalapenos as it tries to stay in focus  is pretty awesome as well and again like i said   a pretty awesome variant to what's already a  classic over here at taco bell in my opinion   already pretty great yeah that focus was jumping  around just as much as my taste buds right now   guys and i have to say again the heftiness of  just this half is pretty amazing i mean it's   pretty substantial in the hand and naturally with  the amount of cheese covering across the top of it   it really feels like it's worth the premium  price point i mean at close to six dollars   i'm really glad this is actually packed with the  good stuff and again just to kind of keep showing   you the inside it's all the classic goodness that  you know from taco bell just with the added cheesy   goodness on the outside and again all the toasty  action that you can see from that tortilla in   the bottom it's just a very very delicious cheesy  situation let's go for a couple more quick bites hmm yup i actually really enjoyed this  the first time around but it was just   the standard variation of it there the  intro was just the basic ingredients the   taco bell is known for just the beef  the cheese and all the usual goodness   but with this i have to say the marinated  steak is really adding to this here let me   see if i can pull a little piece of that  out for you try and focus that slightly   hopefully that's staying in focus they're pretty  nice little pieces of meat definitely marinated and nice and plentiful on the inside this really  does feel like i said a double portion of meat   and i'm liking that because of the price point  all right so let's go for one more quick bite on   this one and then we'll finish this review up  with the rating coming up next but guys again   i really love the fact that this is back  a lot sooner than i thought it would be   and again the addition of those jalapenos as  i'm trying to keep that focus for you is a   lovely situation indeed just greatness all around  with this one and i gotta say very very tasty but   i think you knew that already right order ahead  and pick yours up at our contactless drive-thru   so with that said i'm gonna have to give the  all-new spicy double steak grilled cheese   burrito here at taco bell a rock solid 10 out  of 10 now keep in mind this is the official   variation of this one right now but you can  pretty much customize this any way you want but   officially with the double steak i got to say it  really did feel like that guys the marination is   pretty awesome on the meat itself and the quality  was shining through if there's one little knock   against it though is the fact that the red strips  on the inside i think they're just there for color   because there was no real crunch from anything but  even still you got a lot of saucy goodness a lot   of cheesy goodness and overall a lot of heartiness  across the board and for almost six bucks for this   thing you'd expect that not bad all right so for  all of you peeps who enjoyed the original grilled   cheese burrito when it came out not that long ago  drop some comments down below how excited are you   to try this variation of it with double steak i  mean are you really looking forward to this one   drop those comments down below and definitely let  me know and with that this is Ian K closing out   another high quality foodie feature for you here  on peep this out reviews bringing you brand new   content
