 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty 1 2 3 fight alright everyone let's get it it's ian K k back again with another high quality foodie feature for you here on peep this out reviews this time returning on over to mcdonald's as well as good old bk down the street because as you already know i'm pitting the newly released spicy chicken mcnuggets from mcdonald's against the ever popular spicy nuggets from bk so let's get started with the focus of everyone's attention at the moment it's the all-new spicy chicken mcnuggets and as familiar as these look to you guys they should because they are the regular chicken mcnuggets that you know and love only this time the coating has got cayenne and chili peppers on the inside for a little bit of extra heat looking nice and crispy and definitely looking to bring it and for dipping we've got the mighty hot sauce a nice blend of spicy chilis crushed red peppers and garlic so when you combine the two you've definitely got a heated situation on hand coming up next we've got bk spicy nuggets at a very popular price point eight for a dollar you definitely can't fade that what we've got here is a standard crispy home-style spicy seasoned breading over some white meat and it's looking pretty tasty and i figured for dipping let's go for a little bit of extra heat given the mighty sauce situation from mcdonald's we've got buffalo sauce to go with so i think it should be pretty interesting to see how these flavor profiles go against each other let's see exactly how that's going to go down let's peep this out all right so this is actually not going to be a full breakdown review for each of these guys considering i've reviewed them separately here on the channel in detail which you guys can find down below in the description right now it's really going to be more about the flavor profile and the overall value the overall bang for the buck which is going to be worth it naturally and of course to go in on them together i think it's going to be a lot of fun all right so before i get started which i'm actually going to begin with the spicy chicken mcnuggets after all these are the super most popular thing out right now and i really want to get back into these after my initial review if you guys are fans of high quality delicious looking food reviews make sure to hit that subscribe button down below and don't forget to tap that bell icon so you can be notified as soon as brand new content drops every week guys very excited once again to go in on the spicy chicken mcnuggets a little red tinge right over there a nice situation let's go for a quick bite of this we'll get into some mighty sauce and then we'll move on real quick chicken mcnugget flavor very familiar with just a little bit of heat that begins to build as you swallow it then it kind of stays with you for a bit but as you can see there nice tasty white meat guys and of course that crispy coating on the outside lovely situation and they're definitely tasty i mean guys you can't beat the familiarity of something that's over 40 years old that really hasn't changed in terms of the flavor it's classic it's iconic for a reason let's go for a quick dip into that mighty hot sauce real quick and see what that does for that overall flavor of the spicy chicken mcnugget already yeah you can really smell the peppers in this one here let's give this one a go a little dip action let's combine it with the crispy coating of this chicken mcnugget here we go yeah mighty in name for a reason very hot way up there that's a nice combination for this i think i see why they have the heat a little subdued on the chicken mcnugget itself it's more on the back end because when you combine it with the heat with this it really kicks it up tenfold it really is very very strong but again i think that's the combination that works so far pretty nicely yeah it works so nicely in fact i definitely need to grab some water real fast here guys let me cleanse the palette since we're gonna get into the bk's version next okay ready for action let's give this a go bk there you go nice situation i definitely love the presentation of these actually as you guys can see you can see the peppery goodness a little bit more on the outside of this one it's a little bit more threatening looking than the other i mean there is a red tinge as you saw from the chicken mcnugget i'll show you the comparison in just a sec but as you can see there is no doubt something is going on with this here in terms of the heat department here so let's give this a shot then we'll get into some buffalo sauce well that's a little bit lighter than i remember the first time around i'm not really getting a lot of spice here with this right now but obviously it's got a little bit of something at the end but nothing really as pronounced as the spicy chicken mcnugget as you guys can see on the inside see if i can try and focus that for you it's okay in terms of the size there a little on the smaller side but you'd think because of the outside looking a little bit more threatening it might be a little bit spicier but so far not so much i mean i like it it's just not really standing out as being really really spicy initially kind of like the spicy chicken mcnugget where in the beginning it doesn't seem like it either but then it really kicks in towards the end so you know what i have a feeling the buffalo sauce is gonna do wonders for the bk nugget right now let's go for a dip all right so let's grab one of these here and go for it as you can see a little bit of the creamy action over here the buffalo sauce over here at bk is a little bit more of the ranchy style it's thicker but it's definitely tasty let's give it a go savory and creamy a little bit of extra heat not nearly as hot as the mighty hot sauce but still pretty tasty and of course it pairs amazingly well with it even with the regular chicken nuggets nice amount of heat on this still and hey just because i'm curious and i have the opportunity right now let's go for a spicy chicken mcnugget in the buffalo sauce from bk so a little bit of that ranchy goodness to go with the back end burn of the spicy chicken mcnuggets let's give this a shot this is looking pretty good mmm that's amazing a little bit of the heat on the back end but it's more from the buffalo sauce than anything else because it's a little bit lighter on the spicy chicken mcnuggets guys in general but that's actually really good that combination is pretty nice mmm all right and because i'm very curious now let me grab the mighty hot sauce and of course we'll go with the bk nugget here guys this should be pretty interesting considering the heat level of this mighty hot sauce which is serious right now along with bk's version right now too let's go for it that's so hot in general wow it's almost masking the coating of the bk nugget i'm not really tasting a lot of flavor from the bk nugget actually this almost feels like it was specially formulated to go with the flavors of the chicken mcnugget i'm not really getting anything above like chunky type of chicken that's pretty much it it's kind of weird that's still pretty good though yeah but it's hot all right so let's go for one final look at these two before i decide the overall winner and starting off with bk obviously eight for a dollar is a great selling point with this one here it looks great for advertising and obviously they have a very nice presentation nice and crispy they look very threatening with that spicy goodness on the outside it's not as high as i would have liked but it definitely does satisfy in terms of the flavor obviously with the spicy chicken mcnuggets very popular a timeless flavor close to 40 years old with a little bit of heat but when you pair it up with that mighty hot sauce a lovely situation but there's only one ultimate winner that i think can take it here and you're about to find out what it is so with the rivalry as timeless as batman and the joker themselves guys for me personally ever since i was a kid it's always going to be between mcdonald's and burger king it always has been and while many of you will probably say well you gotta throw wendy's into the mix because their nugs are awesome as well for me personally it's always gonna be about mcdonald's and burger king and that was the main reason that i wanted to do this because guys it's the first time the spicy chicken mcnuggets are available here in the u.s and actually with the spicy nugs at bk how could you not put those two together to really see who comes out on top and when it comes to who's on top it's upon my opinion anyway i'm gonna have to go with drumroll please the spicy chicken mcnuggets at mcdonald's like i said guys the flavor is timeless it hasn't changed in well over 40 years so when you add just a little bit of heat to it it's taking what's already familiar and very tasty and adding a little bit of extra heat now while it's not initially up front heat it's more on the back end that mighty hot sauce goes a long way to really combine with it to give you a really nice experience and guys the quality is solid and that's taking nothing away from bk which like i said is a great value for a dollar i mean eight of those for a buck is very satisfying the flavor is decent and i wouldn't say their generic tasting let's just say you really can't fade the flavor of the chicken mcnugget it's iconic for a reason and it does stand out so any little improvement as far as i'm concerned on top of that is a bonus so while technically you're getting less nuggets on the mcdonald's side because you're getting six for two bucks compared to eight for one over at bk they're a little bit thicker a little bit harder and honestly like i said the flavor just delivers that combination works all right so i've got one basic question for you very simply do you agree with me drop some comments down below let me know what your thoughts are based upon what you've seen and heard in this versus video and also what's your favorite between the two drop those comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K closing out another high quality foodie feature for you here on peep this out reviews bringing you brand new content every single week here on my
