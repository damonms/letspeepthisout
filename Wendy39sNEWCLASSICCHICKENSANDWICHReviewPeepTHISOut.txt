 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty alright everyone let's get it it's Ian K back  again with another high quality foodie feature   for you here on peep this out reviews this  time returning to wendy's to check out their   new chicken sandwich that's actually supposed to  be crispier juicier and dare they say it pickle-ier   so let's go in on the very simply named classic  chicken sandwich and judging by this premium bun   we're definitely in for a very soft situation  here guys let's take a look underneath it and   see what we've got looks like a decent amount of  mayo but guys take a look at those pickles four   of them there nice and crispy nice and crunchy  looking and they're very thick cut really digging   that we've got a tomato slice we've got a leaf  lettuce slice and that's all sitting on top of   a 100% white meat chicken breast that's breaded  up pretty nicely here guys it's not overly huge   but definitely looking pretty decent underneath  that looks like nothing is there but guys overall   very simple build on this one but it looks pretty  tasty so let's see if the queen of fast food can   deliver the flavor with this one it's the all  new classic chicken sandwich here at wendy's   let's peep out this flavor yeah i think we can  all pretty much agree when it comes to fast food   chicken sandwiches wendy's is absolutely up there  as one of the kings in the game and considering   the appearance of this one i gotta say this is  looking really really tasty the most striking   feature for me though is definitely those pickles  that is a lovely situation right there guys   can't wait to get into this one right now for  sure but of course real quick before i do that   and like always if you guys are fans of high  quality delicious

look at this one feast your   eyes on it it's the classic chicken sandwich a  very simple name for what looks like a very simple   build but let's see if the flavor is going to  deliver here at wendy's let's give it a shot hmm   pickle yeah right out the gate those pickles  easily delivered on this one guys and i got to   admit with everything combined with it there it's  a nice situation but it's very familiar tasting   but as you can see those pickles being as thick  as they are they're delivering a wallop of flavor   on top of everything else here but on the surface  with everything else you're getting a very solid   chicken patty and i got to admit it's a little  on the thin side but the quality is very high   so this is a pickle showcase on top of the  light breading that the chicken has got   and actually the meat is pretty juicy it actually  is pretty juicy let's go for another bite well i don't really know about crispier  with this one here it's not overly breaded   so this pretty much tastes like the standard  chicken patty over here at wendy's and again   there's nothing wrong with that because it is  a nice piece of white meat fairly juicy as well   lightly breaded but with everything else on here  right now the simple build the highlight is easily   going to be those pickles i'm going to keep saying  it throughout this review because it's so true   they add so much to this so pickle-ier absolutely  yeah i got to admit this kind of feels a little   bit more of a rebranding of a chicken sandwich  that i think many of us have come to love over   the years over here at wendy's but i have  to admit with everything this has got even   with those pickles it's still very very tasty  and the quality is high so with the breading   not being as thick that's actually not a  bad thing because you can really taste the   white meat of the chicken and it really  does stand out let's keep going with it i guess they couldn't really call this the chicken  and pickle sandwich although that would have been   kind of fun actually because the pickles really  are pretty amazing on this and being that i love   pickles in general that was an easy reason to get  me over to give this a shot to see if there really   was something truly different about this so aside  from the marketing aside from the name it's still   very very tasty but as it stands it's really  the chicken sandwich that i think you're going   to know and love from wendy's already but with the  inclusion of some pretty awesome pickles but still   very fresh and i gotta admit i'm really digging  the overall simple combination of a flavor profile   that works really really well very tasty yeah  nothing too earth shattering with this one but   still a very tasty chicken sandwich nonetheless  so with that said i'm gonna have to give the   quote-unquote almost new classic chicken sandwich  here at wendy's a pretty rock solid  8.5 out of 10 this is definitely not the end-all  be-all of all fast-food chicken sandwiches not by   a long shot but it's still very very delicious  when it comes to the chicken sandwiches over   here at wendy's it's just different enough  because of that pickle flavor to really   elevate this one to a different status so i'm  really liking the fact that it's familiar flavor   with the addition of those pickles which  really make the difference at least for me   pretty good all right so one simple obvious  question did this classic chicken sandwich look   pretty amazing to you right now drop some comments  down below what did you think of the overall   appearance of this one and how excited are you to  give it a shot drop those comments down below and   definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K  closing out another high quality foodie feature   for you here on peep this out reviews bringing  you brand new content every single week here on   my channel so while you stay tuned for that next review coming real soon in
