 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty hey everyone I'm back at this time over a jack-in-the-box because admittedly they've got a lot going on this month so what do you say we take a look at a one tasty-looking side item that could very well be an entree all on its own so let's go in on the variety version of these mini munchies featuring a nice little selection of fried goodness guys pretty much bursting out of this box we've got three panko onion rings nicely fried nice and crispy everything in here is gonna be pretty crispy and fried anyway a very nice situation there we've got their three mozzarella sticks a decent size there and that's sitting with a nice little sampling in the corner of their famous curly fries so lovely situation it smells really awesome for dipping we've got some buttermilk House sauce here of course that's their ranch and we're gonna go for a little bit of that on each of these but really really tasty so far let's give this to go and see how the flavor is gonna be cuz it smells awesome it's the variety pack version of Jack's mini munchies let's peep out this flavor yeah this is definitely a lot of fried goodness for sure but then again who doesn't like fried goodness right this should be a lot of fun to check out right now but like always before I do you guys are fans of high-quality delicious looking food reviews make sure to hit that subscribe button down below and don't forget to tap the Bell icon so you can be notified as soon as brand new content drops every week so let me start off with the onion rings guys I had a lot of fun checking these out the first time take a look at the review popping up on your screen here right now these panko breaded goodness onion rings that these are are pretty amazing right now let's go for a fast bite mmm just like I remember very very tasty definitely some deep fried panko goodness here guys those breadcrumbs are really standing out with this and of course the onion flavor that I'm getting from the onions themselves are very nicely done the breading is about even with the onion so I'm really getting a nice balance between the two but pretty nice guys pretty nice indeed mmm and hey where are my manners right now forgive me forgive me we got to get into some ranch let me open this up and we'll go for a dip ranch is definitely my favorite dipping sauce and it's nice and thick over here at Jack let's give this a shot mm-hmm awesome you knew it would be right that rich creaminess the fried goodness with this the onion flavor nice combo alright this little variety pack is set off very nicely with the panko onion rings but let's go with some of the world-famous curly fries and see how this is real fast mmm yup that fried goodness with the light outer coating that it's got it's actually very reminiscent to the Arby's curly fries believe it or not they're very similar in terms of the texture in terms of the flavor and I got to say they work very nicely and of course they're gonna work even nicer with some ranch let me grab a little bit more of these here and then we'll go for that dip again a ranch with fries is a no-brainer you know this is gonna be awesome right well I'm thinking it's gonna be so let me confirm it for you mm-hmm confirmed the rich tang of that ranch along with the light seasoning on the outside of the curly fries is already up there in terms of flavor already but the nice shape that it's got because they're curly is just adding a layer of fun to the overall experience so very very tasty on that speaking of tasty let's go for the main event guys I've never had the mozzarella sticks over here at jack-in-the-box and I don't know if these have ever been offered here before but let's give this a shot I'm very excited to give this a go nice and crispy on the outside let's give it a go hmm it's okay I'm definitely diggin the outer coating that it's got it's just firm enough to give you a little bit more to chew on and the flavor of the cheese is pretty good it's nice and salty and I think that's a byproduct of the overall breading on the outside but decent quality guys not too bad at all but honestly let's see how this is with ranch and then let me see if I can split one of these towards you on camera to hopefully get a little bit of cheese pull here we go again it's a fried coating with ranch how bad could this be right let's do it very tasty I kind of prefer that instead of marinara sauce believe it or not it's pretty good the crispy saltiness of that outer coating along with the nice flavor of the mozzarella really pairs up very nicely with that ranch guys the tang and the richness that I'm getting from it is a very beautiful combination and as tasty as that all is I really wish I had a little bit of cheese pull right in the beginning to kind of set it off so you know what as promised let me grab another one of these here and we're gonna try and crack this towards the screen see if I can focus this in there we go hopefully we'll get a little bit of something here but I doubt it let's give it a shot well maybe a little bit but it is what it is but as you can see that one is a virtually hollow what happened there it is what it is guys nice crispiness the flavor of the mozzarella is decent but this one is clearly hollowed out what can you do that right what can you do head to jack-in-the-box experience the joy of missing out with my mini munchies so I gotta say this is a pretty decent sized pack for three bucks and considering the size of those panko onion rings and the mozzarella sticks it's not a bad value for what you're getting because the individual pieces definitely have some nice solidness to them guys they really do fill up the box nicely of course the fries in the very bottom I wish I had just a little bit more of those but for three bucks what could you do it's really not that bad so overall I'm gonna have to give the variety pack version of Jackson mini munchies a pretty OK 7 out of 10 if only there was just a little bit more of those fries like I mentioned I think it would have been even better but as it stands it's decent for what it is very familiar flavor it all kind of tastes the same believe it or not because of the fried coating but that ranch really does take it up a notch really really tasty just for that and it does come with it so you have that to look forward to now the question is are you looking forward to this one drop some comments down below if you've got a jack-in-the-box in the area are you gonna be giving these mini munchies a shot over here and if you are are you excited to give them mozzarella sticks a shot drop those comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K closing out another
