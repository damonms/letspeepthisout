 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty what's going on everyone it's Ian K back again  with another high quality foodie feature for   you here on the channel where this time i'm  over at sonic america's drive-in because it   looks like they've got cheesesteak back on the  menu for a limited time only only this time out   it's supposed to be extra long and ultimate  well i'll definitely be the judge of that so   let's go in on what they're calling the extra long  ultimate cheesesteak and already guys i'm a little   underwhelmed by what i've got in front of me here  right now but let's start off with the laundry   list of ingredients and then we'll talk about it  what you're looking at is one of their standard   foot long buns that's supposed to be filled with  philly sirloin steak grilled onions crispy tots   a zesty cheese sauce and shredded cheddar cheese  and i gotta be honest guys the ultimate name is   used a little sparingly here because there's not a  lot of anything on the inside of this that i think   would warrant that name it doesn't really look  like it's filled and while i like the appearance   of the crispy tots on this one they obviously  do those very well over here at sonic i am not   digging how old the meat looks i gotta admit this  does not seem fresh to me at all and like i said   not a lot on the inside of this bun here guys but  you know what it's all about the flavor let's see   if this one delivers so here we go with the new  extra long ultimate cheesesteak at sonic let's do it   crispy top that's a highlight but man that  philly sirloin steak that's on the inside   of this one is absolutely overcooked it's  not juicy at all and guys it looks very   very dry just to kind of bring that up for you  just to show you a little piece of it there   look at that there is no moisture on that  whatsoever it feels like a little chip actually   not digging that at all yeah super dry i don't  know about you guys but like i said there's   nothing on the inside of this that warrants the  ultimate name much less saying it's extra long i   mean this is a standard foot long hot dog bun  that they use here so honestly it's a little   underwhelming in that regard just because of the  size being what it is it's cool but there's not a   lot on the inside of it here i didn't really get  too much of the cheese sauce let's go in again okay there it is i mean it's okay but ultimate  no i don't know if you can kind of tell towards   the bottom but i do have a few little specks  of grilled onions but guys this was just thrown   together no love whatsoever to make this right now  and it feels like it's been sitting at least in   the meat department the cheese sauce is fine it's  warm the crispiness of the tots are fine as well   but when you're gonna call something ultimate  and say that it's extra long you're expecting   it to be sizeable and in this case it really  fails in that regard because the flavor is just   okay but it just doesn't taste fresh for me  right now and while it's cool to have some   nice crispy tots on the inside of this i mean  they're obviously adding some more denseness to   the overall package here that should not be what's  filling out what's supposed to be an ultimate type   of cheesesteak you're expecting more meat more  cheese you want the ultimate name to stand out   this is really just a strict rebranding of what  was out maybe a year or so ago that i reviewed   and that was actually with jalapenos believe  it or not with baja sauce which incidentally   you're probably seeing that one pop up on your  screen here right now I'd definitely recommend   checking that one out because it'll give  you an idea of what to expect with this one   minus the tots of course and that baja sauce that  gave it some spiciness and essentially the spicy   version now is just jalapenos added to this so  you're actually getting a little bit less this   time out at least in the sauce department because  they are adding the tots but they're jacking the   price by 30 cents i think that last one was  like $3.99 but guys very underwhelming with   this one and again you're gonna call something  ultimate come on already you know i mean come   on let's go for another bite on this one i  think you know where this review is going there is no meat in this yeah the more i'm getting  into this the more my disappointment is beginning   to grow because literally there is no flavor to  the meat whatsoever and it's very overcooked and   very dry no juiciness no moisture and obviously  the plentifulness is just not there so guys   ultimate in name only but very lackluster  right now and just to show you again   let me bring up another piece of this meat this  almost feels like beef jerky i'm not kidding   this is not cool at all guys i always have a love  hate relationship with sonic because they have   such potential and they advertise some really cool  looking stuff but when you get the actual product   this is what i'm looking at here right now  this is just minutes old and this is a no   bueno situation so let me go for one more little  quick bite of the meat we'll go for another quick   bite of this one and that's it guys very  very lackluster right now very lackluster and again i don't know what's up with that extra  long name this is literally the same footlong bun   they used the last time out with these cheese  steaks only this time for me anyway this feels   like a beef jerky sandwich with some cheese sauce  and some tots that's pretty much it guys one more   bite we'll finish this one out no bueno oh such  potential with this one sonic but this really   was a very lackluster product to go for today and  unfortunately it's going to be scored accordingly   so guys nothing to recommend on this one if you  can get this one made fresh i'd probably recommend   doing that if you want to give it a try just to  satisfy your curiosity but obviously guys this   is something i am never going to get again it's  just it is what it is sonic extra long ultimate   cheesesteaks so with that said i'm going to have  to give the extra long ultimate cheesesteak here   at sonic a very lackluster 3 out of 10 and the  only reason it's getting that three is because one   it was warm two the bun was actually nice and soft  and i definitely dug that and three those crispy   tops were definitely a highlight guys there was  no flavor otherwise and literally nothing on the   inside to make it warranted for the ultimate name  didn't feel plentiful at all and even at $4.29 you   are expecting a little bit of sizability in terms  of the meat department and guys this is supposed   to be a cheesesteak give me some fresh beef or at  least some beef on the inside that simulates that   at least that i mean come on all right enough  enough this thing is definitely getting chucked   as soon as i finish this review right now so  real quick drop some comments down below are you   excited to give this a shot and if you actually  had this the last time out are you actually going   to be giving this one a go as well just because  it has tots drop some comments down below and   definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K closing out another high quality foodie feature   for you here on peep this out reviews bringing  you brand new content every single week here on   my channel so while you stay tuned for that next review coming real soon in the meantime stay frosty   well i definitely like the slick packaging these  footlongs come in sonic but that's not gonna save   this one right now oh no no not at all hey thanks  for checking out another one of my reviews but   just in case you didn't see the one before this  one you can find it right up over here along   with what i think youtube's going to recommend  for you to check out as well as always i think   you'll find something to like in both of them and  i'll definitely catch you in the next one see ya
