 what's going on everyone and welcome  to the channel where today I'm over at   good old BK because it's spooky season  so of course you know what that means   that's right and you already know so stay tuned  because the ghost pepper Whopper is up next   welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K  stay frosty man oh man does this thing look really   awesome guys Feast your eyes on it let's get into  it here we go with the ghost pepper Whopper just   in time for Halloween over here at BK and as you  guys can see that orange bun is pretty striking   I'm totally digging the contrast with that ghost  pepper cheese right there in the middle pretty   banging let's break this one on down real quick  yes sir they absolutely nailed this orange Whopper   bun guys that contrasts with those black sesame  seeds looks really great on this here let's pop it   and take a look underneath and what you're going  to notice right away is a ton of those crispy   jalapenos there is no shortage of them whatsoever  and they're all attached to a spicy queso sauce   which kind of looks like nacho cheese sauce but  guys that's two levels of heat right there as we   pan Down You're Gonna notice more of those crispy  jalapenos of course we've got some crispy bacon   and guys ghost pepper cheese a lovely situation  I'm totally digging the contrast between the color   of the orange and everything else here it's pretty  cool so aside from that in the bacon goodness   of course this is sitting on a quarter pound of  flame grilled beef guys the classic Whopper Patty   for sure and underneath it it looks like we've  got just the bottom of the bun but again that   orange color is really nailed beautifully with  this guys this is really really awesome so there   you go this looks like it's going to be three  levels of heated goodness I'm sure this is the   just in time for Halloween ghost pepper Whopper  here at BK let's peep out this flavor yeah guys   this looks great I really I'm totally digging  the color of the bun on this one it's more of   a subdued type of orange but it goes beautifully  with that ghost pepper cheese right there in the   middle and I think it combos beautifully with all  the other colors here with the crispy jalapenos   being green and naturally with that queso sauce  very excited to get into this guys and I gotta   say this is hands down one of the best looking  versions of the Halloween Whopper yet starting off   with the black bun Whopper from years ago which  I definitely enjoyed checking out the nightmare   King which is a blast to check out as well all the  way down to the very limited ghost Whopper that   I actually made the pilgrimage to San Diego to go  check out so take a look at my BK playlist you'll   find all of those there but guys this again very  very awesome the Orange is crazy cool on this and   considering the color of the bun anyway it's just  a little bit more of a heightened color compared   to a regular Whopper bun actually it kind of looks  very similar but you can see it really does stand   out beautifully so let me see if I can confirm the  heat for you this is looking pretty tasty one more   time it's the just in time for Halloween ghost  pepper Whopper here at BK let's peep this out mmm cheesy oh yeah buddy the crispy jalapenos for sure on this  one along with that spicy queso sauce hang on mmm wow it's almost like a spicy nacho cheese  sauce it's pretty much the flavor that I'm   getting with this but with the crunchy jalapenos  on top of it and guys I gotta say overall with   the bacon the smokiness that is a very lovely  situation wow that's definitely got some heat   guys this really feels like an elevated  Whopper as it should with Ghost Pepper   in the name but again the presentation I  gotta say what those black sesame seeds   is banging on this so far very very tasty  let's keep going in guys this is pretty great mmm wow there's a lot of cheese flavor on this  I am loving that just look at that guys not   only does it have a fair amount of heat on  this particular one you're getting a lot of   cheesy flavor for sure I'm not really tasting  that ghost pepper cheese down below and maybe   mixing very nicely with the spicy queso but with  those crispy jalapenos those are the wild card   with this one all of that dovetails right into  the flame grilled goodness of the Whopper Patty   on the bottom and guys again just the overall  cheesiness factor is through the roof with this   one it's very tasty and it's absolutely got some  heat to go with very nice and hey it really helps   to have some really nice looks with this one  guys I mean the Halloween season I pretty much   think belongs to BK they're the only ones in the  game that really do Burgers like this and I love   the fact that this one really stands out I've  been talking about an orange bun for years in   my other reviews and I'm so glad that we finally  have it this year and thankfully they didn't do   like a pumpkin spice whopper or something like  that because of the orange naturally this is   actually a very nice combination and you know  what going forward I think pretty much the only   thing they can do at this point aside from all  the main Halloween colors that have been done   at this point is maybe go like a purple bun maybe  to finish it out maybe comboing between black and   orange orange and black naturally and again The  Duality with the seeds in the top is a beautiful   contrast I'd love to see like an orange top and a  black bottom maybe next year that'd be pretty cool   but guys this is pretty fun all right so enough  talking let's go for another couple of bites on   this one guys I'm totally digging the amount  of cheese that's in this let's keep going in hmm you know it's one thing to have a lot of heat  on something like this but naturally when you have   a spreadable type of cheese on top of a slice of  cheese in general you know there's going to be   cheese in every single bite and then add in the  fact that those crunchy jalapenos which are so   super plentiful on this guys that's where the heat  is really coming from with this again gotta keep   showing it to you it looks beautiful and that  bun is a major highlight it looks so striking   all the way around with this particular one it  really is nice hopefully that's coming through   on the camera for you because it has got a very  nice color as soon as you unwrap this you're   going to notice it right away it looks really  really great so yeah as you can tell this is a   pretty worthy addition to the Halloween Whopper  lineup they've had over the years over here at   BK guys and again with the orange bun again  a very beautiful situation on this here and   hopefully they'll do something like this again  next year maybe doing with some different colors   to kind of mix and match that'd be kind of  cool but guys as it stands a lot of heat a   lot of tasty flavor with this and a lot of cheese  let's go for one more bite we'll wrap the review   up coming up next with the rating but guys super  fun one more bite I'm gonna close it out hang on yeah I think most of you guys are going to  get the vibe of nacho cheese sauce with this   one guys it kind of tastes like something you  get at like a ballpark kind of like a side of   nachos with their queso very similar to that  but with crunchy jalapenos the flame grilled   action from the Whopper on the bottom but  a very striking presentation with this bun   very very fun over here at BK for this year and  it's great to see the orange color very very cool   yes sir hands down that's got to be my favorite  version of the Halloween Whopper yet guys and   with all the cheese that's on that how could  it not be considering I'm a fan of cheese in   general outside of the presentation which is  really killer so just to confirm it for you of   course this one delivers the heat very nicely  as well as the presentation and with that said   I'm gonna have to give the all-new ghost pepper  Whopper here at BK the obvious 10 out of 10 guys   it's hard not to like that one not only does it  look great it actually tastes pretty awesome as   well plenty of cheesy flavor plenty of heat to  really kind of go around and I have to say again   aside from the presentation and that heat it's a  super fun product around Halloween being that BK   kind of owns this Market nobody else really does  it that looks amazing and again The Duality of   the colors look beautiful on that I love the way  the seeds look the black seeds on the top with   that orange it's such a great combo and overall  like I said it delivers it's got the heat the   cheesiness and definitely something fun to check  out as of October 13th Nationwide definitely give   this one a shot it's pretty banging all right so  do me a quick favor after you guys give this one   a go drop some comments down below let me know  what you thought of the look of this particular   one when you first unwrapped it what was your  initial impression and then after trying it was   it just as cheesy for you and heated drop those  comments down below and definitely let me know   and with that this is Ian K closing out  another high quality foodie feature for   you here on peep this out reviews bringing you  brand new content
