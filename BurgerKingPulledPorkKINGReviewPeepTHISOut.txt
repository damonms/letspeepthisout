 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty it isn't the first rodeo for BK when it comes to summertime themed sandwiches and their latest sure looks to be shouting that in a king sized way that's right so let's go in and the all-new pulled pork king and already that aroma of barbecue sauce is lighting up my car pretty ridiculously right now almost like a hickory sweet type of barbecue sauce and it's doing the job in the aroma department let's pop the top on the sesame seed bun and see what we're working with underneath plenty of crispy onions guys there is a plethora of them there lots of good stuff there we've got the barbecue sauce looks like we've got a bunch of pickles in there as well and a heaping portion of that pulled pork looking really really tasty I think this is gonna be a pretty crunchy pretty sweet tasting sandwich already but looking pretty crazy and I gotta say the smell again super strong once I pop the top it's even stronger so let's get into this right now and see what the flavor is all about this is the all new pulled pork King here at BK let's peep out this flavor so are you a fan of high quality delicious looking food reviews well if so definitely hit that subscribe button down below and don't forget to tap that Bell icon so you can be notified as soon as new content drops every week now let's dive into this one man this thing is definitely packed and there's a ton of crispy onions on it here we go it's the pulled pork King here at BK mmm-hmmm well right off the break guys that barbecue sauce is absolutely lighting this one up here it's very very sweet with just a little bit of spice but nothing too crazy at all but the sweetness is definitely off the chart at least for my liking anyway but it's decent plenty of crunchy onions the snap of that pickle overall it's a very very hearty first bite let's keep going with it mmm the pulled pork itself kind of has a manwich or a Lloyd's type of quality to it there it's definitely a sloppy joe type of sandwich but everything else on this one is taking the center stage for me at least in the flavor Department the barbecue sauce is super strong if not just a tad spicy but nothing too crazy and then those crispy onions and the pickles guys it's pretty tasty and it's definitely a hearty sandwich as you can see most of you guys probably know I'm not really a super fan of very very sweet barbecue sauces and thankfully the pickles on this are bringing that down just a little bit because of the acidity the crunch and naturally just the overall feeling of having something in addition to that really strong barbecue sauce but guys the pulled pork is plentiful and those crispy onions add a very nice touch let's keep going with the guys it's not bad mmm I like it even though it kind of smacks of a sloppy joe type of sandwich but there is a decent amount of pulled pork in here guys and they don't skimp on the amount of everything on the inside of the sandwich it pretty much covers the circumference of the circle of that whopper bun not bad at all I'm gonna try and take you 360 on this one hopefully without dropping a single thing off the sandwich here guys cuz there's plenty of those crispy onions but as you can see a plentiful amount of that pulled pork for sure you've got a lot of those crispy onions as always and the pickles are about four or five of them on here are pretty decent overall a pretty nice summertime themed sandwich and the flavor is absolutely on par especially feel like a sloppy joe type of situation you're gonna dig this one it's not bad at all well I'm not so sure this one's really worthy of the king name considering we're missing those two flame-grilled patties that the king burgers normally have so overall what we've got here is a fairly decent fast-food pulled pork sandwich with a decent amount of crispy onions scratch that a huge amount of crispy onions and a pretty okay amount of pickles as well and while the consistency and texture of that pulled pork in general kind of reminds me of like manwich or Lloyd's that type of brand I would have much rather have had just the pulled pork on its own with some barbecue drizzle because I think that would have been a little bit more effective but what you're having with this one is a very decent amount of barbecue sauce and if you like the sweetness factor you're definitely dig this a lot thankfully the pickles take that down just a bit at least for me so overall I'm gonna have to give the pulled pork King here at BK a pretty decent 8 out of 10 I'd probably get this one again and maybe ask for a little bit of extra pickles on top of it just to give me a little bit more of that acidity but overall it hearty guys and it definitely fills the need especially if you like pulled pork but of course the question is do you personally think you need to try this drop some comments down below are you a fan of pulled pork in general and how do you think this actually compares overall to some of the pulled pork sandwiches you may have had in the past drop those comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K closing out
