 hey everyone I'm back at it this time over at Papa John's for a little heated cheesy goodness so stay tuned because the jalapeno cheese sticks are up next welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty well the jalapeno aroma is definitely kicking in the car right now thanks to these jalapeno cheese sticks from Papa John's and guys this is a very lovely situation this almost looks like a personal pizza actually well maybe just a little bit bigger but definitely a lovely situation here as you guys can see we have got a loaded group of sticks here guys 14 of them about 10 inches each except for maybe the end ones there but as you can see they are loaded up with jalapenos we've got some mozzarella cheese and that's all on some fresh dough baked to perfection a lovely situation indeed and like I said the aroma is kicking big time here for dipping let's open this up real quick looks like we've got a little bit of the marinara action so it's gonna simulate more of a regular pizza here but a lovely situation guys these are the jalapeno cheese sticks from Papa John's let's definitely peep out this flavor yeah I was definitely thinking about something a little on the cheesy side today with maybe a little bit of heat thrown into the mix and not necessarily a full-on pizza although I was actually going that route at least I was thinking I was this actually looks like it's gonna fit to go pretty nicely guys I mean these jalapeno cheese sticks do look pretty great already so before we get into this one to hopefully confirm it for you if you guys are fans of high-quality

jalapeno cheese sticks from Papa John's I've always wanted to try these and now I'm glad I have the opportunity to let me see if I can pull one of these up here really quick for you there is a lot of sliced jalapenos already there take a look at that guys that's actually looking nice right there sticking up very nicely you can see through that one pretty nicely as well let's give this a shot and see how this is gonna be its the jalapeno cheese sticks my first time having them here at Papa John's it's as you'd expect a little cheesiness a little bit of heat hmm that is a lovely situation take a look at these jalapenos guys that is nice lemme focus that in for you nice cut on these jalapenos no seeds but man that heat is really beginning to kick that's a lovely situation hang on mmm why did I wait so long and give these a shot these are pretty good man really good actually let me pull some of this crust off real fast hmm you can definitely tell this was made pretty fresh guys I'm definitely digging these mmm all right let's go for a dip in some marinara real quick here I'll pull off another one I'm gonna go for a kind of bigger piece here this is actually really really good highly recommend this already let's go for a little dip in that action right there take a look lovely situation we got a little marinara action very very nice here we go the marinara with the jalapeno cheese sticks hmm that's actually not bad I'm normally a ranch guy as you guys know but you know what with the heat it's taking this one up a nice notch here it is actually the marinara sauce you'd get on their pizza anyway but this is really good hmm it's vibrant with those jalapenos on here guys nice flavor not too overly sweet but the heat is nice and like my gripe that I've had with some of these things in the past I only wish the marinara sauce was a little bit on the heated inside there is no heat to this whatsoever a little cold but it's okay mmm okay so let me give you one more look at these here as you can see about 10 inches long for each of these the size is fairly decent trying to keep this focused for you but as you can see the jalapenos a very nice situation a decent amount of cheese as well no sauce obviously because their bread sticks or cheese sticks as they call them in this case here but the heat is very nice and it mixes very nicely with the flavor of the cheese you can really taste that nicely and the dough itself nice and crispy on the bottom I got to admit guys I really like the overall crispiness of this here this is actually a lovely situation playing with the focus because of the weather outside it's really jumping everywhere but as you can see a nice situation on this and an easy recommendation guys and a good side item to any item that you would probably get over here it's pretty good for the value six bucks for fourteen of these I'll take it and you know what I'm really glad that I did so with that said I'm gonna have to give the jalapeno cheese sticks my first time trying them here at Papa John's a pretty decent 8.5 out of 10 as okay is that marinara sauce was I wish it was just a little hotter and while it was actually thinking about ranch in the back of my mind while I was doing this review right now I'm glad that I tried it with the marinara to kind of stimulate a little bit more of that Pizza vibe that's what I was kind of feeling today to begin with so the fact that I'm getting these cheese sticks this more than satisfied but like I said guys I think ranch may be the better way to go especially if you're a ranch person like me the marinara is still just okay not bad all right it's question time for you have you guys ever tried the jalapeno cheese sticks over here at Papa John's and if you have what did you actually think of them overall and speaking of which what do you like to dip them into drop those comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K closing out another episode of peep
