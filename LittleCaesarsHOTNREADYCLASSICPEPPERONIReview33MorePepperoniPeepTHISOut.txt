 hey everyone welcome back to another high quality  foodie feature for you here on the channel   where this time i'm over a little caesars to see  exactly what 33% more pepperoni looks like on top   of their classic pepperoni pizza that's right  and apparently it's hot and ready too so stay   tuned because it's up next welcome to peep this  out reviews with Ian K stay frosty pizza pizza   so here it is the classic pepperoni pizza at little  caesars and if you're saying to yourself you know   this looks pretty familiar guys you would be  correct this really looks like they're standard   pepperoni pizza but i gotta be honest what they're  trying to push as new with this one let's just say   i'm not so sure all right so very simply what  we've got here is their large standard pizza   crust topped off with their familiar marinara  sauce and cheese blend but the big draw with this   one is supposedly 33% more pepperoni so i  guess we can pretty much call this one the extramostbestest   mini but on the surface guys i got  to be honest this doesn't look too different from   their regular pepperoni pizza but hey considering  it's only $5.55 i am definitely not hating on it i   mean the price point is pretty solid and judging  by the appearance of this one it still looks like   a pretty tasty pepperoni pizza so if you're  trying to count the pepperonis on this one   you can actually stop because i counted already  and there's about 30 of them on here so with the   standard extramostbestest being about 50 you're  looking at probably maybe originally about 20   or so pepperonis on this and they maybe threw on  maybe 10 12 13 extra i guess but at the same time   this looks very familiar and still a very tasty  looking pepperoni pizza all right so let's confirm   what i think is going to be pretty tasty anyway  this is the classic pepperoni pizza featuring   quote-unquote 33% more pepperoni here at little  caesars let's peep out this flavor little caesars   changed the hot ready classic and added 33% more  pepperoni well i guess we can call this one the   middle sibling considering the extramostbestest  is the top gun and of course the regular pepperoni   pizza features just the regular pepperoni slices  but with this one supposedly having 33% more than   that it still looks pretty tasty and at the same  time it's pepperoni pizza from little caesars $5.55   you can't really hate on that so let me put  this one down it's always a challenge like i say   here reviewing pizza in the car let's pick up  a slice and there you go pepperoni pizza action   i gotta say this looks no different from what i've  had in the past year but considering i've never   really reviewed a regular pepperoni pizza here  on the channel like this i guess i figured i'd   just fill in that playlist this is looking  pretty tasty guys let's give it a shot the   quote-unquote new 33% more pepperoni on the classic  pepperoni pizza here at little caesars let's do it it's what you expect tasty now as i'm sure most  of you peeps know i'm not really into pepperoni   as my all-time favorite go-to topping i mean  i like it but sausage is definitely the way   to go but considering the promo with this  one this really does fill this out pretty   nicely this slice is pretty much covered with  a decent amount of pepperoni on this one and   they're nice and crispy of course with the  cheesy goodness the sauce the crispy crust   on the bottom especially it's definitely  a pretty tasty first bite for sure but a   very familiar first bite let's just keep going  in guys still delicious stuff not bad for $5.55 yeah i'm definitely digging how nice and crispy  the back of this pizza looks right over here guys   and considering pizza is one of my all-time  favorite foods you didn't have to twist my   arm very hard to get me over to little caesars to  check this one out much less the other guys with   whatever promo they've got going on but i'm really  digging the overall quality of what i've got here   and for $5.55 it's what you'd expect from little  caesars a value-sized pizza with supposedly   more pepperoni but again i'm not feeling  that aspect of it still pretty tasty though   but i gotta be honest as much as i usually  save the crust for the very back i have to   admit this is looking so tasty right now  i think i'm just gonna go into it real   fast before we go on with the front of  it here but still guys very tasty stuff good stuff basic pizza little caesars but  it's crispy crunchy definitely digging that   and even though this is not necessarily the  extramostbestest pizza it's pretty much   i guess in the middle compared to the way  they're advertising this one for a dollar   more i believe you can go for the extramostbestest so they want you to step up into that   this is a nice little stepping stone to  get your feet wet so to speak with some   tasty familiar little caesar's goodness  let's keep going in for a couple more yeah i'm definitely digging the fact that there's  plenty of cheese on this as well because again   i love cheese i love pizza this is absolutely  satisfying my itch right now for something like   this and again even though it's quote unquote 33%  more pepperoni you're still getting a very decent   value at $5.55 pepperoni on its own i have to  admit nice and crispy just a little bit of spice   that it's got there as well but everything else  goes so nicely with what i've got here and again   i keep coming back to that price point because  little caesars is considered like a value brand   but you are getting a pretty decent amount  of goodness here for the price point still   all right so whether you believe this is  actually 33% more pepperoni compared to the   normal version that you may be getting on average  which is usually about five dollars or so anyway   you can't fade the fact that guys it's  little caesars you're getting a decent   value the taste is pretty familiar and  again pretty banging stuff one more   bite we'll close this one out with  the rating coming up next hang on all right so let's go with another shot of one  of these slices and i got to say guys one thing   that i really like about this as well today  is the fact that considering the amount of   pepperoni that's on this there's not a lot of  grease to go around and that's actually a good   thing because it doesn't feel overly oily but at  the same time that familiar flavor is there and   again the crispiness of those pepperoni are really  lighting this one up i mean it's got a little oil   but it's not over abundant where it's really  soaking the box and again the toastiness on the   bottom with that crust is pretty awesome i've  said it a million times throughout this review   pretty decent value for $5.55 but considering the  quote unquote 33% more pepperoni add-on with this   one i'm still not so sure pizza pizza well like  i said earlier you don't have to twist my arm   too hard to get me over to try anything new that  little caesars puts out because guys like i said   pizza is one of my all-time favorite foods if  not the favorite food it's such a gluttonously   delicious type of thing to have personally for  me on a rainy day it's the best but at the same   time $5.55 for that and a very decent amount of  pepperoni nonetheless it's still very tasty   all right all right i know i've said that a  million times so overall i'm going to have to   give the quote unquote new 33% more pepperoni on  the classic pepperoni pizza here little caesars   just an okay 7 out of 10 i think this is kind  of just rebranding itself for the year i think to   kind of get you to look at little caesars to come  on over to give it a shot if you haven't already   but considering the pepperoni that's on that  and the overall quality i would still come over   either way guys and again ad nauseam it's still a  little less than six bucks for that whole pizza so   eight slices you're satisfying the itch and the  quality of what you're getting is pretty tasty   all right so i've got one simple question for  you if you guys frequent little caesars pretty   often to get the pepperoni pizza did this variant  actually look like it had 33% more pepperoni to you   drop those comments down below and definitely  let me know and with that this is Ian K closing   out another high quality foodie feature for you  here on peep this out reviews bringing you brand   new content every single week here on my channel  so while you stay tuned for that next review coming   real soon in the meantime stay frosty i don't know  little caesars 33% more pepperoni or not obviously   the extramostbestest is the way to go so i see  what you're doing i
