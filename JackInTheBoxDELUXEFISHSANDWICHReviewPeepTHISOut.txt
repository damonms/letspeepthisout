 hey everyone welcome back to another high  quality foodie feature for you here on the   channel where this time i'm headed into jack in  the box because it's fish season and not only   is their standard fish sandwich back on the menu  it looks like they've got a double filet variant   available as well that's right so stay tuned  because the deluxe fish sandwich is up next   welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty hi what can I get for you yeah peep this out can  i just go for that deluxe fish sandwich by itself   and that's it deluxe fish sandwich by itself you got it  any drinks anything else oh no that's it Ok $6.57 thank you   great thanks a lot all right so this is my first  time trying to fish over here at jack in the box   and i'm doubling up on it i'm glad you guys are  here along for the ride with me hey how you doing yeah awesome thank you excellent appreciate it so quick  question is this one a pretty sizable sandwich   does it look like the picture is it pretty big  cool cool looking forward they almost never look   like the poster but we're about to find out would  you like any condiments oh no it's fine thank you   all right i appreciate it stay frosty we'll  see ya buh bye alright guys let's peep this out   so is this gonna look like the poster will you  tell me feast your eyes on the all-new deluxe fish   sandwich here jack-in-the-box and aside from the  bun looking a little small maybe a little bit more   squished i think it looks pretty close so starting  off with the obvious what we're supposed to have   here is a fresh buttery bun although it does  look a little on the cracked side on the top there   underneath it however it looks like we've got  a dollop of some tartar sauce and some shredded   lettuce and underneath that i'm a little scared by  the amount of tomato on this guys two large slices   of tomato action right there underneath it there's  the first of the two 100% wild caught alaskan   pollock fish fillets that are coated in panko  breadcrumbs and i gotta admit they're looking   pretty tasty there separated with two slices of  american cheese as you can see there's the second   patty right there not too bad underneath it we've  got more of that tartar sauce action but guys so   far it looks fairly close to the poster as far as  i'm concerned aside from the bun being a little   on the smaller side and again i'm a little afraid  with the amount of tomato on this one guys i mean   i'm okay with doubling up on the fish obviously  that's one of the main reasons i wanted to do   it naturally but two slices of tomato i don't  know let's just give this a shot here we go with   the deluxe fish sandwich my first time trying  the fish here at jack-in-the-box let's do it mmm no no no no no sorry definitely  sorry no bueno on the tomato   you know i guess it's a testament to how fresh  that tomato is because it was ultra wet ultra   slimy and the outer skin no bueno at first  bite but the flavor of the fish is pretty   good so far and i'll give you a close-up  in just a second but so far i'm glad i got   the double because there's some denseness to  it and i'm liking that let me keep going in oh yeah well i'm glad i got the fish sandwich  diaper on the back of this one because there   is plenty of tartar sauce coming out the back  of this here guys there's a lot more than i   thought there was going to be after that initial  close-up anyway there's definitely more to be had   but honestly the cheese i'm kind of tasting as  well and it's not too bad it's kind of keeping   those patties together and i'm really digging  that i think that's the main purpose of it   since it's not on the one with just a single  patty by itself but so far the flakiness of   the fish is on point and i'm really digging  this so far yeah definitely digging this so   far guys and just to show you real quick in the  back here again plenty of tartar sauce flying   out the back so i'm glad that they wrapped this  one and again i really love the presentation so   far this is pretty good for fast food fish  i guess i'm kind of being slowly converted   over because the quality of what i've had so  far has been pretty good let's keep going in yeah definitely good yeah i'm really digging  the coating so far on this guys i mean it's   not nearly as breaded as i thought it was  going to be and the fish itself is pretty   plentiful especially when you've gotten the  double on here it's flaky it's got a little   bit of juiciness to it as well it's not dry and  again the cheese i'm kind of tasting which is   kind of a cool thing so so far guys a very  very nice outing over here jack-in-the-box   let's go in for another bite i'll give  you another close-up but pretty solid yeah i like looking at the inside of this one  guys i am definitely digging the flakiness of   that fish in the overall breading and i have to  admit again the height that it's got is pretty   nice i only wish the bun was just a little bit  fresher that's the only thing this does feel as   it's a little on the staler side i got to be  honest you can kind of tell by the amount of   cracks on this one but guys honestly aside from  that very nice quality of the fish so far and   overall the tartar sauce has got a nice amount  of creaminess as well lovely situation so yeah   i like it and the fact that i have this choice  available from jack in the box now aside from   the cajun flounder that they have over at  popeyes this is actually a very nice season   of lent starting off for me here right now guys  some pretty nice fast food items that you can get   in terms of fish this is actually up there with  it and again you should do the double because   it's got some denseness some heartiness and it  really is the way to go just my personal opinion   all right so let's go for one more bite in this  one we'll finish this one up after the rating but   guys this is obviously going to be scored highly  because it's super fresh the quality is pretty   solid and for a fast food product this is actually  not bad let's go for another bite all right one   more quickie shot of this one just to finish it  out and as you can see a lovely situation in the   fish department guys the double is absolutely  worth the upgrade and obviously the cheese i   can kind of taste as well not too bad with the  overall fried coating and an easy recommendation   definitely give this one a shot and please do  the double i think you know that by now right   order on ubereats postmates and grub hub so with  that said i'm going to have to give the all-new   deluxe fish sandwich here at jack-in-the-box my  first time trying their fish a pretty rock solid   9 out of 10 the only thing keeping this away from  that 10 spot and as you can probably guess by now   it's going to be the freshness of that bun which  really wasn't there for me but everything else was   pretty much on point guys the light flakiness of  the fish itself the fact that it wasn't heavily   breaded on top of it and i can taste everything  pretty nicely with that creamy tartar sauce   minus the tomato of course a beautiful situation  a high recommendation to give this one a go   all right so now the obvious question are you  going to be giving this one a go if you've   got jack in the box in the area and you've had  the fish sandwich before in the past is it one   of your favorites and if you've never had it is  the double gonna be on your hit list drop those   comments down below and definitely let me know and  with that this is Ian K closing out another high   quality foodie feature for you here on peep this  out reviews bringing you brand new content every   single week here on my channel so while you stay  tuned
