do four great thank you so much alright so true story one of my mom's favorite fun meals is an ultimate cheeseburger and a hot coffee so I originally thought I was gonna do iced cuz that actually sounded good but you know what let's just keep it traditional hey how you doing gotcha thank you you got it with that Hershey goodness and there you got it thank you so much for doing what you do seriously appreciate it awesome thank you ultimate cheeseburger awesome thank you stay safe and stay frosty we'll see ya alright buh-bye alright guys let's peep this out here we go with a definite fast-food favorite the ultimate cheeseburger here at jack-in-the-box featuring lots of beefy cheesy goodness as you can see plenty of beef right there guys we've got some American and Swiss style cheese peaking out starting from top to bottom you've got the bakery style bun we've got some ketchup some mustard normally Mayo and then it's just the beef and the cheese so it looks really really good I got to admit just like I remember a little bit of gooeyness right there in the middle lovely situation indeed to wash it down somewhat we've got their new boosted coffee here at Jack as well this is the large so the regular is basically stronger than two cups of coffee this is gonna be four easily and for the flavor surprised it wasn't a pump included here but it's Hershey's caramel chocolate here as you can see so looking pretty good from international delight let me lift one of these over here and we'll just simply pour this in do this carefully what I'll do is I'll actually light this up with at least three of these to see how the sweetness is and then we'll go from there but excited to see what that flavor is gonna be overall in the intensity for the caffeine I'm sure it's gonna be pretty awesome but here you go it's the ultimate cheeseburger a classic over here a jack-in-the-box along with one of their all-new boosted coffees let's peep out this flavor feel breakfast famous try my new boosted coffees in french vanilla Hershey's chocolate caramel or black yeah it has definitely been years since I've had the ultimate cheeseburger here at Jack but it's looking just as cheesy just as beefy as ever so momma peep this one is definitely for you all right guys before I confirm this one for ya if the guys are fans of high-quality delicious looking food

fast food favorite here at jack-in-the-box let's do it mmm beefy and I am all for it guys that classic flavor is right there take a look at that really just delicious beef and cheese that's all you really need with this one here of course you've got that ketchup you've got the mustard in there if you like mayo you'll like it that much more with it but all you really need is just the beef and the cheese I probably could have gotten this plain and it still would have been awesome but again the light tanginess of the ketchup a little bit of that bite from that mustard is not bad either but just a delicious situation guys it's a classic for a reason mmm oh yeah fairly juicy believe it or not too and that's a great thing because sometimes the beef's a little on the dry side here at Jack but right now I'm getting a nice combination of some pretty decent moisture and of course the cheese to go with it's just a nice combination all around and speaking of all around let's do a quick 360 here look at that guys it's really as basic as you can get but it's just so satisfying without the need for any special sauces or anything like that it's just a really really tasty cheeseburger and a double at that over here at Jack just a lovely situation one more bite and we're getting into that boosted coffee because I really want to give that a shot let's do it mmm really good and I can honestly see why my mom along with countless others really digs the ultimate cheeseburger like I said it's a classic for a reason and it definitely gets the job done all right speaking of getting the job done let's move on with this review and check out one of the new boosted coffees here at Jack a nice large cup of hot coffee featuring international delight Hershey's chocolate and caramel let's give this a shot and by the way I put in the four of them actually as well so this is creamy oh that's a lovely situation creamy not too sweet believe it or not even with the four but again I do have the large so it's kind of really mixed in pretty nicely here mmm that is so good it's rich it's creamy it's nice and hot definitely a quality bean right here guys this is really nice mmm that really is good the chocolate is subtle so you know what I'm actually gonna try this with a bite of the ultimate cheeseburger just to kind of see I've never really had coffee with a burger before I believe it or not it really doesn't sound like it would mix well and granted this does have a little bit of chocolate in it let's give it a shot with a little quick bite of the ultimate cheeseburger and see exactly what my mom is talking about here here we go okay good stuff here we go that's kind of different but good in a good way I don't want to take the coffee with the burger at the same time you know what let's just do that I'm curious because I really was concerned about mixing the two flavors together I like the coffee chaser after the bite but let's see if I can kind of mix it together and see if it's gonna make a huge difference I don't know if you guys actually eat hamburgers with coffee drop some comments down below let me know if you mix it that way I mean hardcore mix it that way I'm gonna try it for you right now here we go that's not bad even with the ketchup that's crazy that's crazy hang on okay I could see myself doing this on occasion not an everyday thing but the creaminess is actually kind of adding to the overall flavor of the burger believe it or not and the combination is delivering for me which is really kind of strange because I never thought about having like charbroiled beef and mixing it with coffee like directly usually like as a chaser right after but believe it or not it's actually pretty good together so not bad alright so the ultimate cheeseburger along with one of the boosted coffees here at Jack a very nice combination whether you have it immediately after you take the bite or during I think the combination works well and considering the Hershey's caramel that I had with this it's actually a really really nice flavor you've also got french vanilla available for these boosted coffees as well as just regular black but guys a nice combination I think no matter which item you pair it up with but the ultimate cheeseburger is definitely a great choice alright so as for the ratings starting off with the ultimate cheeseburger that one's gonna get a rock-solid 9 out of 10 it really hasn't changed all the years that it's been around and honestly from what I remember it's exactly the same so like I said you can get this with mayo normally and you're gonna like this one not much more but it's just beef cheese a bun and it gets the job done hey that kind of rhymed alright as for Jack's boosted coffee the large variant featuring the International delight Hershey's chocolate and caramel that's gonna get a pretty decent 8.5 out of 10 the only reason it's not any higher than that and it was delicious don't get me wrong was that I really wasn't getting any caramel flavor I mean it was a decent coffee flavor for sure with a little bit of chocolate but not real caramel so overall the sweetness is not that high which I really liked but the flavor does deliver and don't get me wrong it really goes very nicely with the ultimate cheeseburger well whether you chase it or have it during its really pretty tasty all right I've got two important questions for you first have you ever had the ultimate cheeseburger here at jack-in-the-box drop those comments down below and definitely let me know and also let me know what your thoughts are of it in general if you have and secondly do you actually combine coffee and beef in one sitting I mean when you're eating it together do you literally eat them together drop those comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K closing out another episode of peep this out bringing you brand-new content every single week here on my channel so while you stay tuned for that next review comin real soon in the meantime stay frosty you know now that I think about it they probably should have just call this Jacked coffee I mean naturally with the jack name in there because boosted is cool but considering how much caffeine has probably has already since it's stronger than 2 cups in a regular this is 4 I think Jacked would have been a better way to go name wise just saying alright guys until next time I'll talk to you soon but hey real quick before you go and just in case you haven't already take a look at the last review that I put out right up over here along with what I think YouTube's gonna recommend for you to check out as well as always I think you'll find something like in both of them and I'll definitely catch ya in the next one see ya
