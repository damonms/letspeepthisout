be one heck of a cheesy treat so let's go in on the extra cheesy alfredo garlic parmesan crust pizza and guys this looks and smells glorious right now have a look at all the cheese on this one here guys they are not messing around for sure nice and toasty nice and golden a four cheese blend guys actually on top of a two cheese alfredo sauce and of course that's on their pizza crust here at the very end we've got that garlic parmesan goodness as well but man this looks and smells fantastic I'm just gonna keep panning over this so you can see all that cheesy goodness it's like an ocean of melty deliciousness guys really really awesome add in that 2 cheese alfredo sauce and this one should definitely pop with additional flavor and naturally how could you not have even more garlic goodness with their awesome garlic dipping sauce so you better believe we are absolutely going to be going into this but guys in terms of presentation this looks absolutely fantastic and I can't wait to get into it so let's do just that it's the extra cheesy Alfredo garlic parmesan crust pizza here at Papa John's let's peep out this flavor yeah the smell of that garlic parmesan crust does not get old at all I had so much fun checking out the luster version of this pizza a couple of months back take a look at that review popping up on your screen if you haven't seen it yet but guys it was super delicious so I have a lot of high hopes for this right now on top of all the cheesy goodness I'm about to get into so before we get started and like always if you guys are fans of high quality

extra cheesy Alfredo garlic parmesan crust pizza here at Papa John's it's a mouthful of a title but I have a feeling it's gonna be a mouth full of flavor let's do it oh oh mmm oh man wow first of all if you like a little extra salt in your cheese you are gonna love this right now because the flavor instantly grabs you it's a little on the saltier side but guys there's four types of cheese on this on top of the two cheese Alfredo super cheesy nice and crispy on the very bottom of the crust I like that and I love how it's kind of like a golden-brown on the very top but Wow super flavorful and like I said a mouthful of a title to match this mouthful of flavor right now you guys got to get somewhere close up to this it's pretty amazing mmm hmmm let me get you right up in there as close as I can here without touching the camera but as you can see it's a lot of cheese but a very thin layer of the alfredo sauce and I like that because it really is a cheese show for sure even though alfredo is a main ingredient in this one it's really all of that cheese that's really adding to the overall goodness of the garlic parmesan crust in the very back here so another major highlight there you're getting some of that Romano artisan goodness along with the actual flavorfulness of the crust to go with all of that cheese and I love the light toastiness of it but guys if you like cheese pizza in general and you're not really big on alfredo just let that go because the cheese really steals the show with this one it's awesome and since I haven't had the garlic parmesan crust since I did that review a couple of months ago let me go for a quick bite before we go further mmm crunchy garlicky nice flavor it's a nice little breadstick action when you get to the very end of all the cheesy goodness that I'm getting nice buttery type of feeling that I'm getting overall and I think that's primarily from all the oils that are coming from the cheese here right now but when you mix that with the Alfredo which is subtle you're getting a really really tasty pizza and guys a new version of the garlic parmesan crust with these types of ingredients sign me up I'm glad I'm doing this right now mmm all right you know what's coming because we absolutely have to do it let's go for a dip in that garlic sauce my all-time favorite you can never have too much garlic especially when it's the garlic sauce here at Papa John's like I said my all-time favorite dipping sauce and I love putting it on any pizza they come out with here let's give this a shot this is already smelling amazing mmm tasting amazing instantly mmmm I love it the instant rush of that butter with the garlic and then you're getting all of the cheese the saltiness of everything together and then a little bit of the crunch of that crust on the very bottom this is really really good lemme go for another dip in this here you guys don't mind do you it's just an excuse to always have pizza on camera with you guys while I'm checking this out and I love reviewing Papa John's for you on my channel especially with this garlic sauce it's delicious mmm banging absolutely banging I love the toastier parts of the cheese on this here guys it really does kind of bring out a little bit more of the flavor and considering how subtle the alfredo sauce is it's a nice combination in general pair that up with the garlic crust naturally and you're gonna get something very flavorful even if you don't add the garlic sauce which you should it really is a highlight guys but honestly delicious stuff and easily something I'm gonna be getting again this is really pretty great mmm so yeah I think you garlic lovers are gonna be in for a treat with this one you can't go wrong with the amount of garlic that's all throughout this pizza and if you've already had their garlic parmesan crust to begin with just imagine a nice heavy dose of that four cheese blend to go with the two cheese's inside the alfredo sauce itself and you already know this is gonna be pretty insane add in that garlic sauce to go with it it's a done deal guys all day long this is pretty awesome so as if you really need me to confirm this for you right now I'm gonna have to give the extra cheesy Alfredo garlic parmesan crust pizza here at Papa John's the obvious 10 out of 10 it's a garlic show of epic proportions here guys on top of all the cheese you can't go wrong with the overall flavor with this one especially when you pair it up with that garlic sauce it's just absolutely delicious now of course the obvious question at least to me anyway is it this look pretty delicious to you right now drop some comments down below are you a fan of Papa John's Pizza in general and if you are how excited are you to try a four cheese blend on
