 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty what's going on everyone it's Ian K back again  with another high quality foodie feature for   you here on peep this out reviews returning to  church's chicken once again because after checking   out their all-new chicken sandwich recently you  know i had to go into the spicy variant right   so let's get into it and as before we're greeted  with a very nice star-cut bun let's pop and see   what we've got underneath well looks like we've  got plenty of pickles this time around and we had   about four of the last times we've got a little  bit of extra this time spicy mayo is also there   along with their honey butter toasted into the  bun very nice there take a look at the chicken   itself as you can see it is fried up to a crispy  golden brown and of course coated with that spicy   mayo a very lovely situation of course underneath  it looks like we've got more of that spicy mayo   so there's no shortage of it and you can really  smell it too and off to the side take a look at   what this comes with a nice plump jalapeno that  is a really nice add-on to this so even if you get   the original you've got a little bit of extra heat  to go with but as you can see a very cool simple   build on this one but it really does look and  smell pretty fantastic so let's not waste any more   time it's the all new spicy chicken sandwich here  at church's chicken let's peep out this flavor you   know as i'm looking at the spicy chicken sandwich  up close it looks like the patty's a little bit   smaller than the one that i had more recently but  even still it is fried up to a crispy golden brown   and there is plenty of pickles on the inside here  guys and again no shortage of that spicy mayo top   to bottom still a fantastic looking situation  and the aroma is lighting up my car beautifully   as it should okay so real quick before i get into  this one and like always if you guys are fans of   high quality

right i've got high hopes for this right  now considering the more recent original chicken   sandwich take a look at my review popping up  on your screen right now if you haven't seen   it spoiler alert it was pretty fantastic so let's  see how the spicy variant does here we go right   off the break after that nice softness of the bun  and the crunch of the chicken that spicy mayo is   beginning to kind of spread out it's a little bit  of a sizzle that i'm getting in the background   with a little bit of light butteriness coming from  the honey butter believe it or not it's adding so   much to the overall flavor and honestly i'd expect  it to because that's one of the signatures over   here at church's but on top of all of that  we've got some really awesome pickles that   are really helping to elevate the flavor profile  even further on this one so let me go for another   bite and we'll give you that close-up but guys  it's pretty tasty you'd expect it to be right is it texas pete or is it texas heat i'm not  sure but it's definitely adding a nice amount   of sizzle to this one guys and it's really  adding to the overall flavor of this on   top of the honey butter that's toasted into  the buns that's a really awesome signature   and it works amazingly well but as you can see  the patty this time out is a little on the thin   side still flavorful still juicy but i wish it  was just a little bit thicker but even still   it's very tasty and of course those pickles are  adding to the overall experience with this one   not bad yeah sometimes the chicken patties  on these sandwiches can be hit or miss i   mean ultimately we'd love to have exactly  what's on the poster right i mean just a   really thick piece of meat and while this is not  super super small it's definitely smaller than i   had it the first time around but even still the  flavor is delivering let's go for another bite yeah that is really really good and i gotta  say even though i'm not really a super fan of   mayo this is not really tasting like mayo  whatsoever it's more like a creamy heated   type of sauce it actually has a little bit  more heated elevation over the other guy's   chicken sandwich believe it or not and honestly  guys i think i like this a little bit better   so a very solid situation with this overall and  i'm really digging the overall quality of what   we've got here the white meat is juicy again  your mileage may vary with some of the chicken   patty sizes but it's generally pretty decent but  all the other stuff on this one is really what's   lighting this one up and i'm really digging it so  easy recommendation guys if you've got a church's   in the area give this one a shot the spicy is  pretty bomb church's bringing that down home   flavor alright so if you're gonna ask me real  quick which one do i prefer the original chicken   sandwich here at church's chicken or the spicy  variant i'm probably gonna say the spicy because   i really like that sauce but i really wish the  thickness of the patty was a little bit thicker   this time around that's the only difference with  it really the same type of sandwich naturally it's   just the addition of that spice is really making  this one what it is but naturally the thinness   of the patty is affecting it just a little bit i  wish it was just a little bit thicker but still   guys very delicious either way so with that said  i'm gonna have to give the spicy chicken sandwich   here at church's chicken a rock solid 9 out of  10 had this been a little bit thicker it would   have been a perfect 10 out of 10 but if you guys  want to round it up you guys already know it's   a delicious chicken sandwich from my last review  that is a beautiful situation with the inclusion   of that spicy mayo and while it doesn't taste  like traditional mayo with just a little bit   of heat it really feels like a creamy type of  spicy sauce something unique all in its own   it plays extremely well with the honey butter  that's toasted into the bun and that honestly   is what makes it for me just super delicious  all around okay so like the last time around i'm   gonna ask you are you gonna be giving this one a  shot if you've got church's in the area drop some   comments down below let me know if you're gonna  be giving this a go and if you've tried it already   which is your favorite out of the two the original  or the spicy and lastly are you gonna be traveling   to give this one a shot if you don't necessarily  have church's in the area i'm very curious to   know that one drop those comments down below and  definitely let me know and with that this is ian K   closing out another high quality foodie feature  for you here on peep this out reviews bringing   you brand new
