insane on these Cinnabon dessert biscuits here we go mmm oh my god oh my god hmm you want to talk about hashtag pillowy goodness this is absolutely it guys super soft on the inside of this right now and of course all the Makara cinnamon glaze the cream cheese frosting this is absolutely heavenly let's go for one more bite and of course I'm gonna give you that close-up mmm man first off you can tell these were made absolutely fresh guys look at how thick and fluffy that is on the inside so it's nice buttery doughy goodness and then on the very top of that the Makara cinnamon glaze of course with that cream cheese frosting all the signature flavors of Cinnabon minus the swirliness that you kind of get when you bite into one of those but the denseness and the thickness of KFC's biscuit really soaks up the goodness on the very top of this guys this is super heavenly and literally a four piece should go pretty quick if you're a fan of Cinnabon because the flavor is off the chart with these of all the days to not bring anything with me to drink right now considering how hot it is guys this is super dense super filling and you're gonna want to have some milk you're gonna want to have some water something on the side to help you wash it down but it's buttery it's definitely gooey and I'm really loving the Cinnabon flavors guys and you can't beat the official packaging this comes in it's really a nice touch mmm so smooth and let me just say they didn't skimp on the amount of cinnamon glaze and the cream cheese frosting on these guys it looks absolutely awesome presentation-wise and of course it's gonna highlight all the flavors of the original biscuit especially the denseness of it on top of the Cinnabon flavors that you know and love this is an easy recommendation and like I said for four three bucks you cannot beat that at all I mean a regular is about 5 bucks on its own and considering you can actually get four of these for free with at least a 10 piece meal or higher you already know guys this is gonna be an add-on you're gonna want to add this on trust me mmm let me give you one more shot of this one as if you don't want to see what this looks like again up close right I mean I am absolutely loving filming this right now and there is so much glazy goodness all throughout and the smell is still kicking in my car right now guys this is absolutely delicious and they're very very hearty so nice job on this combination I think this is probably one of my favorite versions of Cinnabon outside of the regular version of it and guys it's definitely a recommendation you need to go get these but make sure you've got plenty of napkins when you do mmm classic Cinnabon goodness guys that is so so good OK so is if you really need me to give you a rating on this one guys this is an easy 10 out of 10 there is nothing wrong with these whatsoever especially when they're right out of the oven the way these apparently are it's just a very hearty very filling version of the classic Cinnabon flavors with the famous biscuit here at KFC rock-solid KFC Cinnabon dessert biscuits free with a 10 piece meal but of course I got to ask you did
