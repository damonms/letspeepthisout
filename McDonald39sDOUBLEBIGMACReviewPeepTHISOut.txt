 hey everyone I'm back at it this time over here at McDonald's because well there's no other way to say this except four all beef patties special sauce lettuce cheese pickles onions on a sesame-seed bun that's right the double Big Mac is finally here so stay tuned because it's up next welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty so mcdonald's is promoting new flavors to love but when it comes to the double big mac i would assume this is something a little bit more familiar just a lot more of it and as you guys can see it's definitely tall i have to admit this actually looks really good the double Big Mac is packing four beef patties and all the standard goodies of the Big Mac itself let's take a look underneath the sesame seed bun looks like we have got nothing on top ironically that's kind of strange but then let's go a little further in we've got the two meat patties 100% beef underneath that here comes the pickles we've got some onions we've got the Mac sauce we've got the lettuce you've got that middle bun the iconic middle bun underneath that more beef patties two of them of course and the cheese very surprising they actually have the cheese on the bottom of this one only looks like a couple of slices and plenty more of that Mac sauce there guys but it is what it is it's those four beef patties special sauce lettuce cheese pickles onions on a sesame-seed bun and it's definitely very very tall sure looks pretty meaty let's see if the flavors gonna deliver I think we already know what to expect it's the double Big Mac here at McDonald's let's peep out this flavor you know just looking at this is making me long for the return of the Grand Mac I guess this is what we're getting for 2020 but guys the Grand Mac was definitely bomb if he curious to see what that one was all about take a look at the review popping up on your screen right now that was a blast to check out but four beef patties on a regular Big Mac it kind of is what it is very curious to see what it is but I think we know how it's gonna go so before I confirm it for you and like always if you guys are fans of high quality delicious looking food reviews make sure to hit that subscribe button down below don't forget to tap the Bell icon so you could be notified as soon as brand new content drops every week here we go the double Big Mac at McDonald's let's do it hmm yeah that's a lot of beef but admittedly it's a little bit easier to manage than say the Grand Mac because the size of the patties are a lot smaller take a look at that there as you can see it's a lovely situation because they're stacked and I do like to taste overall of course it's the Big Mac that we all know and love but essentially very very messy on top of it but the beef is standing out it definitely feels like a solid Big Mac for sure definitely feels like it's gonna satisfy an appetite if you're a fan of the Big Mac you're gonna like this anyway but while yes it does have a lot of beefy flavor it's a little bit on the lazy side because honestly you can get this made if you really wanted to get something like this it doesn't have to be officially available but it's nice to see it on the menu but four beef patties not too bad and hey for those of you who may be wondering exactly how much beef is on the double Big Mac just so you guys know the standard Big Mac is about 1.6 ounces of beef so at 3.2 ounces if you double that it's still a little bit less than 1/4 pounds so it's not exactly huge in terms of the meat quantity but the thinness of it and the fact that it's stacked and actually size of the Big Mac in general when you think about it it's a lot of bread that's where most of it is coming from but guys still very tasty it's a Big Mac let's go for one more bite we'll give you another close up I think you know what to expect from this one guys it's a Big Mac with a little bit more meat but not too much more meat it's really more for advertising if you ask me let's go for it so let's go 360 with this one because there's really no need to go more than a couple of bites you already know what to expect it's very messy there is a lot of Mac sauce on this right now as you guys can see it's decent for what it is it's a Big Mac it's everything you know what to expect from it it's just a little bit more beef a little bit more sauce overall from what I'm gathering here and overall just a lot of beefy goodness but again a little lazy if you ask me I really want that Grand Mac especially with those fresh patties that would be awesome not bad though oh and hey did I mention you should have plenty of napkins on hand guys like I said this thing is slipping and sliding everywhere right now so with everything you've just seen and heard in this review I'm gonna have to give the double Big Mac it's a little lazy but the double Big Mac here at mcdonnell's is gonna get just an OK 7 out of 10 it's the iconic familiar flavor of the Big Mac with a little bit more beef that's pretty much it exactly what you'd expect it to be and at $5.99 it's an average price point as well but hey if four patties is not really your thing you can always go for the little Mac which is basically just the Mac jr. from a couple of years ago brought back with a different name and if memory serves me correctly that was the main character from Mike Tyson's punch-out from back in the day for the Nintendo Entertainment System that was one of my all-time favorite games back then and it still is so not bad for what that says guys like I said it's really more for advertising but if you really want to get me excited McDonald's bring back the Grand Mac with those fresh beef patties that would be insane and truly worthy of a double Big Mac name I think it really deserves to be a little bit than this this is just okay now the question is is this one okay enough for you to actually jump on over to McDonald's to give it a shot first and foremost are you a fan of the Big Mac and if you are is this something that excites you even more than the Grand Mac drop those comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K closing out another episode of peep this out bringing you brand new content every single week here on my channel so while you stay tuned for that next review coming real soon in the meantime stay frosty Mickey D's you
