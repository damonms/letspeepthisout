 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K  stay frosty what's going on everyone and welcome   to the channel where today I'm back on over at  Pizza Hut to check out the final selection off of   their all-new melts menu and for all you pepperoni  heads in the house this one is most definitely for   you that's right guys so let's get it going here  we go with the pepperoni lovers melt here at pizza   and as you can see a very cheesy situation covered  with a lot of crispy goodness let's break this one   on down real fast yeah this one most definitely  looks pretty cheesy guys and absolutely stacked   so what we've got here are two slices of their  thin and crispy crust and in this case it's going   to be filled very simply with pepperoni and plenty  of mozzarella cheese and as you can see guys lots   of cheesy goodness for sure on this one on the  outside we've got the parmesan dusting and I   gotta say it looks really really tasty plenty of  pepperoni coming out the ends of this one as well   I'm definitely digging the presentation and the  aroma is pretty banging for dipping off to the   side the expected marinara sauce to go in on guys  so this is essentially a mini pepperoni pizza but   with the sauce on the side to go into so very  very lovely there but guys coming back to that   flash fry presentation I gotta say this thin  and crispy crust is looking really really nice   so let's not waste any more time on this  one let's see if the flavor is going to   deliver this is the all-new Pepperoni Lover's  melt part of the all-new melts lineup here at   Pizza Hut let's peep out this flavor yes sir  Pizza Hut definitely has the presentation down   with these melts guys nice and crispy and  I love that parmesan dusting on the outside   that is pretty cool okay let me pick up one  of these we'll get this going over here and   absolutely very crispy guys take a look at that  I am totally digging the way this really feels   like a folded over piece of pizza but it's very  thin very crispy we've got the parmesan garlic   action on the outside and plenty of that cheesy  action in there as well that is a lovely amount   of cheese guys look at that with the pepperoni  spread out throughout it that is very very nice   so here we go it's the pepperoni lovers variant  of these melt here Pizza Hut let's peep this out mmm plenty of cheese wow all right so right off  the break let me just say this is exactly what   the pepperoni crusted papadia should have been  from Papa John's that I checked out recently   which you're probably seeing jumping up on your  screen here right now absolutely check that one   out guys because you'll be able to see a pretty  good comparison the only difference naturally is   there's no pepperoni on the outside of this  one and it's a thinner crust but actually   on top of that there is a lot more cheese and  pepperoni on the inside of this so I gotta say   guys this is really a Pepperoni Lover's Dream  right over here there is plenty of the cheesy   goodness and of course the pepperoni action  is coming through pretty beautifully let's   go for another bite we're gonna go into some  sauce guys pretty tasty on this it really is mmm I love the amount of cheese and pepperoni in  this it's crazy good yeah this most definitely   deserves to have that Pepperoni Lover's name  thrown into the mix here guys I'm beginning to get   into a lot of pepperoni in the middle of this and  there is plenty of mozzarella cheese and of course   it's dovetailed beautifully with that crispy thin  and crispy action on the outside along with that   parmesan goodness very very lovely on this one  guys this is pretty hearty but naturally we gotta   pair this up with some marinara sauce to complete  the pseudo pepperoni pizza eating experience right   I mean this is naturally not going to be like  a regular slice of pizza naturally because they   want you to taste all the toppings and dip right  into it but guys a very lovely combination of the   marinara sauce I think I know exactly what I'm  in for with this one let's confirm it for you mmm oh yeah exactly like that pepperoni pizza  with the thin and crispy action pretty tasty   yeah that is really tasty the sweetness that  I'm getting from the marinara sauce is a little   elevated with this one but it's Tangy it's tart  it's got some sweetness to it and when you pair it   up with all the goodness on the outside of this  you have a very hearty semi pizza-like eating   experience with this one but it's very crispy very  thin and it's done extremely well I think this one   can benefit from some pepperoni on the outside  with a little bit of cheese honestly not to copy   Papa John's too much with that but then again you  guys may argue that pizza hut copied Papa John's   considering the papadias over there but guys a  very lovely situation with this again and just   to give you some more of those money shots a very  lovely situation with this let's go for one more   dip on this one we'll wrap the review up put the  rating coming up next I totally appreciate the   fact that these dishes these little cups they  come in with this marinara are nice and wide   because you can really get into it nicely with  that as you can see a very beautiful situation   so one more bite just hang on one second we'll  wrap this review up coming up next hang on mmm well as they say imitation is a sincerest  form of flattery so it's inevitable that this   is going to be compared to the papadias over  at Papa John's but honestly this really is a   different product because of the type of dough  that they're using the thin and crispy has a   lot going for it along with their parmesan crust  on the outside and naturally with these toppings   on the inside as well this one really is the  way that it should be for a pepperoni type   of situation like this but guys it goes amazing  with the marinara sauce the crunch is beautiful   and there is plenty of cheese and pepperoni to  go around so yeah if you're a pepperoni head   and you've made it this far into the review this  should absolutely be on your radar to give a go if   you haven't already it is well worth the $6.99 and  it is super flavorful pretty banging on this one   oh and let me just also say I totally dig the  boxes that these melts come in I mean guys they're   pretty eye-catching with the whole go solo with  our new melts the cheesy crispy loaded action I   gotta say a pretty nice situation with that across  the board and they definitely present pretty well   on the outside as well as in all right so with  everything you've seen and heard up to this point   of the review I'm gonna have to give the all-new  Pepperoni Lover's melt part of the all-new melts   lineup here at Pizza Hut a rock solid 9 out  of 10 and guys that's coming from someone   who's not super down with pepperoni as one of my  all-time favorite pizza toppings this I gotta say   was a very very satisfying plenty of cheese on the  inside the crispiness of that crust on the outside   really kind of dovetailed everything else after  that and of course with plenty of that cheese and   the pepperoni flavor a banging situation there  was a lot of that good stuff on the inside and   naturally with the marinara sauce a very lovely  situation there as well beautiful combination of   goodness and easily worth at $6.99 easily all right  so do me a quick favor drop some comments down   below let me know which is your personal favorite  out of these all new melts over here at Pizza Hut   out of the four that are currently available that  I reviewed which is your personal favorite I mean   the absolute best out of the four that you've  tried and naturally out of my reviews which
