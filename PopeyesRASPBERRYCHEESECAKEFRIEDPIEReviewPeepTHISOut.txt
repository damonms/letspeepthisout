feast your eyes on the raspberry cheesecake fried pie a very lovely turnover style situation we've got going here guys nice fried goodness on the outside of this one here very very nice it feels very hefty and it is definitely hot in my hands right now let me see if i can break this in the middle for you and we'll go down the line and give this a shot you guys will get the first look at it take a look on the inside look at that crispy crispy goodness we've got that cheesecake goodness what this is filled with is raspberry pie filling along with graham cracker crumbs and cheesecake and then it's deep fried in this turnover style crust that you're seeing here guys but man this is a lovely situation and just look at that really really nice amount of goodness on the inside and i gotta admit

let me put this down carefully here because i got to admit this is very very hot right now it feels like it's minutes old let's give this a shot it's the raspberry cheesecake fried pie brand new here at popeyes crispy oh wow mmm the cheesecake and that raspberry right away and then the gram comes up with it and then of course the nice fried outer coating of the actual crust itself but man this is very decadent guys i have to admit i was a little concerned about how sweet i thought this was gonna be but i have to admit with the sweetness level being almost on the medium level here it's really not that crazy the cheesecake is kind of muting a lot of it which is a good thing and it's a very rich cheesecake too very nice let's keep going and really packed in there too you know as i'm getting further into this i'm kind of getting like a blueberry vibe in the back of my head right now and it probably has something to do with the fact that i reviewed their blueberry lemon cream cheese pie not that long ago which you guys can probably see popping up on your screen here right now it's very similar to this because of the cream cheese like filling and the berry taste that i'm getting but it's very rich with the cheesecake and the preserve that i'm getting from that raspberry here it's distinct but almost the same if that makes sense let's go for another bite i am so in love with this right now and i think part of the love is coming from the fact that this really feels like a densely packed pie i mean i was kind of concerned when i slid this out of the carton about the size of it i mean it felt like it was a little bit smaller it really feels like they stuffed the cheesecake in here but it's very thick and very dense so you're getting a lot of the good stuff on the inside and i have to admit it's satisfying when you bite down into this one really really nice flavor so let me knock off this half when we'll finish this review out after the rating naturally but guys a very very tasty sweet treat just as the fall season is upon us right now and again the combination of the cheesecake and the raspberry is a beautiful thing especially with the graham crackers pretty good you know having all that tasty goodness on the inside is one thing but when it's wrapped in a nice fried outer coating that you're seeing here guys that makes a huge difference it's not overly oily the crunch is very nice and it's very distinct compared to bake you can tell this really feels a little bit more decadent and more flavorful because it's deep fried but man the combination of the raspberry the gram crumbs that are in there and that cheesecake a very lovely situation so with that said i'm gonna have to give the raspberry cheesecake fried pie here at popeye's a pretty rock solid 9 out of 10 this is definitely a decadent pie guys like i said it's like they stuffed a whole cheesecake on the inside of that fried outer coating and then when you have the nice rich preserves of the raspberry to go with that it's a nice combination and it really does satisfy for all you berry lovers out there that taste that you're expecting from like a berry pie and then naturally with the cheesecake with the gram mixed with that it's just a lovely combination beautiful combination overall in general all right so now the obvious question at least to me anyway is did this combination look pretty enticing to you do me a quick favor drop some comments down below are you a fan of cheesecake in general i have a feeling you are if you've made it this far into the review but what about when it's mixed with raspberry is this something that excites you and having it on the inside of a turnover style crust that's fried how much does that excite you drop those comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K closing out another high quality foodie feature for you here on peep this out reviews bringing you brand new content every single week here on my
