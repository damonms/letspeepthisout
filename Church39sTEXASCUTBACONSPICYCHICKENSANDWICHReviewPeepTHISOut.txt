 hey everyone welcome back to another high quality  foodie feature for you here on the channel where   this time i'm over at church's chicken because  it looks like they're lacing up their chicken   sandwiches with their all new texas cut bacon  that's right and i'm getting spicy with it too   so stay tuned because the texas cut bacon  spicy chicken sandwich sandwiches up next   welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty so here we go with the texas cut bacon spicy  chicken sandwich here at churches and as always   that presentation is on point guys the toasted  brioche bun is looking really nice on this one   and i can't wait to get into that texas cut bacon  action so without further ado let's do just that   as we pop the top on this toasted brioche bun  you're going to see a decent amount of that   texas cut bacon right there on the very top with  a couple of pickles guys actually about three   pickles along with that spicy mayo and i gotta  say guys it looks like it's lathered pretty nicely   soaking deep into the bun and of course that's  all gonna be on top of their all white meat hand   breaded chicken filet battered up very nicely  and fried to a crispy golden brown guys nice   and crunchy looking and it absolutely fills  out this brioche bun i'm really digging that   it looks like underneath it we've got more  of that spicy mayo to finish this one off   but guys just in case this is not hot enough we're  actually going to be going in on a jalapeno pepper   with this one now this is actually a tradition  over here at church's to squeeze some of that   jalapeno juice on top and i'm definitely going to  be doing that so yes sir i'm definitely looking   forward to getting into this one this is the  all new texas cut bacon spicy chicken sandwich   here at church's chicken let's peep out this  flavor yeah this is definitely filling out the   bun nicely guys and while it's not the biggest  piece of chicken i've really had when it comes   to fast food chicken sandwiches what they  do have here is a pretty high quality piece   and it's thick enough and i have to admit with  that bacon and the pickles looking really nice   i can't wait to get into this of course adding  bacon to anything is going to be awesome   but it's texas style so i guess everything is big  in texas right these strips are not super big but   then again they are fairly plentiful so decent  decent decent let's just give it a shot guys one   more time it's the all new texas cut bacon spicy  chicken sandwich here at church's let's do it bacon does make everything better oh man that's  really good all right right off the break this   is applewood smoked bacon so it's already the  good stuff especially when it comes to fast   food bacon guys but the real turning point with  this one is actually going to be what it's paired   up with when you have the spicy mayo on this  one and of course the quality of the chicken   this is distinctly church's guys it's got a flash  fry type of taste to it but overall the hickory   smoke of that bacon is going amazing the crunch of  the pickle that i got with that one on top of it   a very lovely situation guys very very delicious  let's keep going in this is pretty banging let's get right back into the close-up on  this one guys a solid block of white meat on   this and as you can see the breading is pretty  consistent across the board but the thickness   of the white meat is amazing with it and of course  the combination of the overall flavors i'm getting   with this one along with the hickory smoke of the  bacon is adding overall as well with the light   tang and sweetness that i'm kind of getting from  the spicy mayo along with the heat believe it or   not it's actually working very nicely along with  the soft toasted brioche bun very tasty but of   course the goal with anything being spicy is maybe  to add a little bit more spice to it so being that   i hardly ever use these jalapenos over here at  churches apparently this is the main thing you can   do with these sandwiches here as you can see it's  kind of split down the middle what i'm going to do   is kind of squeeze a little bit on there maybe  a little bit more than that it's probably all   blurry because it's focusing on my face but guys  we're gonna light this one up add a little bit   of kick action to this one wow this is actually  drenched right now before i take the bite of this   i'm just gonna show it to you real fast  hopefully you can kind of see that is nice   and moist on the very bottom you can kind of see  right there but guys let's go with some added   heat with the jalapeno this is actually one of  my first times doing this let's give it a shot oh what have i been doing wrong my whole life  here at church's that i have not been adding   it like this wow the jalapeno kick is banging  on it not overly spicy but just enough sizzle   on top of the spicy mayo wow i am so digging  this right now i'm really almost hurt that a   majority of the reviews i have on my channel are  not including that because i'm going to have to   do it every single time now especially with the  spicy stuff guys that goes amazingly well with the   hickory smoke the crunch of everything together  the juiciness of everything together of course   it's adding its own juice just a banging situation  across the board with this in fact you know what   let's go for more let's go for one more on this  one here we'll squeeze it all in really nice these   are really thick very juicy also guys really nice  in terms of the quality of these jalapenos banging   situation across the board upside down action for  you here we go one more bite let's do it again oh my god that totally transforms this  sandwich in overall flavor that is crazy good   all right i lied i'm gonna go for one more  bite before we wrap this review up with the   rating coming up next but guys i gotta say the  jalapeno totally transforms the sandwich on top   of it i mean you're getting the overall spice from  that mayo in general because it's a spicy variant   but with the juice of the jalapeno added  to it it definitely is an added kick and   the quality is awesome let's go for a  more bite we'll wrap it up guys hang on well this was already a pretty tasty chicken  sandwich right from the beginning after that   first bite guys the smokiness of the bacon and  the overall combination of ingredients really   give you an awesome chicken sandwich eating  experience but again i can't say it enough   adding that jalapeno juice to it totally takes  this one up to another level guys and it really   transforms the overall flavor profile in such a  way that i'm definitely going to be getting this   one again very delicious stuff and i'm glad to  have checked this one out today pretty banging   church's bringing that down home flavor so with  that said i'm going to have to give the texas cut   bacon spicy chicken sandwich here at churches  a rock solid 9 out of 10 guys throw in that   jalapeno juice and it virtually is a perfect  chicken sandwich eating experience at least   for church's right now i got to tell you that is  an amazing situation the flavor profile is taken   up to a whole new level and the overall quality of  the bacon is pretty nice as well and while i know   everything is generally bigger in texas this one  is actually bigger in flavor not necessarily the   thickness of the bacon itself although there was  a pretty decent amount in general i mean you can   taste it pretty well it's applewood smoked bacon  even still delicious stuff all around so no matter   if it's the spicy variant the classic variant or  the one with the smoky q this texas cut bacon does   add a decent amount of flavor overall but like  i said you got to get the jalapeno action to go   with it either way on the side it is so worth your  time very delicious stuff all right so if you've   got church's chicken in the area are you going  to be giving this one a shot i mean if you've   had the chicken sandwiches in the past and you've  liked them i have a feeling you're going to want   to give this a shot i mean it's bacon after all it  makes everything amazing but do me a quick favor   drop some comments down below let me know if  you're going to be giving this one a go and   which variation of the chicken sandwiches are you  gonna try it on drop those comments down below and   definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K  closing out another high quality
