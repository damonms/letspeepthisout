options available so let's get ready to Hulk smash with the Incredible Hulk burrito off the secret menu here at Taco Bell and with that guacamole peeking out the middle there I think you can understand why they call it that what this basically is is very simply their five layer burrito which normally has seasoned beef cheese beans nacho cheese sauce and reduced fat sour cream and all we're simply doing is swapping out the nacho cheese sauce for guacamole so a very simple build on this one it's got all the flavors of taco bell but the green aspect of it is what sells this one guys and the guacamole looks pretty great so let's see if this one's gonna be confirmed to deliver some incredible flavor it's The Incredible Hulk burrito off the secret menu here at Taco Bell let's peep out this flavor alright let me get into the right frame of mind for this one because I haven't had a single thing to eat all day today I'm super irritable I'm very hungry and I really want to get into this right now so without further adue much better I got to tell you I'm feeling better already in fact I'm feeling just a little green but not necessarily in a bad way so much so that I think I'm kind of lighting up my car just a little bit around me with this green glow but guys very excited to get into this one right now let's not waste any more time but first things first if you guys are

every week guys it's the Incredible Hulk burrito secret menu item here at Taco Bell let's do it mmm mmm Wow beefy plenty of shredded cheese on the inside I'm not missing that nacho cheese sauce whatsoever a little bit of the sour cream and guys the guacamole is pretty amazing so far let's go for one more bite and I'm definitely gonna be giving you that close-up this is pretty tasty I am absolutely loving the beastly amount of guacamole they put in this guy's this is absolutely an amazing situation and the fact that you're getting two types of cheese initially on that five layer burrito you're not gonna miss the nacho cheese whatsoever because the regular shredded cheese is coming through beautifully and of course the guacamole flavor along with the beef and that light sour cream is a lovely situation so it's pretty tasty and just so you know if the ingredients of the Incredible Hulk burrito are not necessarily up to your liking you can get the regular Hulk burrito which is basically just a bean and cheese burrito with guacamole minus all the other goodies that the five layer burrito has but guys how could you not go for the ground beef and that sour cream goodness to go with it really rounds us one out and it beefs it up just a bit I mean guys it's the Incredible Hulk after all let's go for another bite mmm mmm this thing is packed with guacamole and I'm so glad that it actually is made extremely well right now the flavor of the guacamole is overtaking everything else along with that sour cream and then of course you're getting that beef action in there as well just a very delicious quote-unquote secret menu item that you can customize pretty easy but guys I love the theme it is definitely awesome going for one last bite and you better believe you're getting that final close up before we round it out let's do it mmm so if you're a fan of the five layer burrito already and you've already customized this with guacamole you've had the Incredible Hulk burrito and you probably didn't even know it but for those of you who don't know it until now definitely load this with guacamole you are gonna thank me for it just a delicious combo of all the taco bell flavors that I think you know and love it's really good well as you can see my complexion has finally come back to normal my hunger is absolutely subsided and I'm super glad to have given this incredible hug burrito a shot over here at Taco Bell let me just say it was a lot of fun to check out and just so you guys know this was technically my very first time trying the five layer burrito even though I didn't swap out the nacho cheese for guacamole it's still considered five-layer and I got to say I would probably get it like that all the time I got to be honest so with that said I'm gonna have to give the Incredible Hulk burrito off the secret menu here at Taco Bell a rock solid 9 out of 10 hunger notwithstanding the flavor was pretty amazing on that and I gotta say the extra guacamole really elevated it a lot of that good stuff is definitely a warranted thing now let me ask you have you given the incredible hulk burrito a shot here at Taco Bell did you know what you were
