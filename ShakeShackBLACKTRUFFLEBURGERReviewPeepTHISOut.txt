 what's going on everyone and welcome back  to another high quality foodie feature for   you here in the channel cheaters cam  style after hours over at shake shack   to go in what looks to be one awesome  looking limited time only burger promo   and dare i say it a little upscale too so stay  tuned because the black truffle burger is up next   welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty so shake shack is not so subtly putting it out  there that it's black truffle season and guys i   gotta say already this black truffle burger is  definitely looking the bomb right now this is   looking and smelling insane you can absolutely  smell that black truffle goodness and i gotta   say the caramelization of this burger the way  it looks on the outside it's looking pretty   awesome all right so what we've got here is a  slightly toasted yet soft potato bun split down   the middle and once we pop it you're gonna notice  it guys plenty of black truffle sauce the organic   goodness and i gotta say it looks fantastic made  with regalis black truffle oil this is definitely   the high quality goodness right over here it  really looks pretty awesome along with it we've   got crispy shallots a pretty decent amount of it  and that's all on top of their caramelized beef   guys that is really looking pretty awesome and it  smells amazing topped off with gruyere cheese and   i gotta say again a very lovely combination of  goodness on this one this just looks fantastic   underneath it we've got plenty more of that black  truffle sauce so they are definitely swinging for   the fences with this one and again that aroma is  insane on top of the caramelized beef this is just   looking and smelling fantastic i can't stop saying  it guys because the presentation is matching the   aroma in the car i can't wait to get into this  and of course you know we're gonna do just that   this is the all new black truffle burger here at  shake shack let's peep out this flavor well as   you just saw in that initial close-up of course  they're advertising black truffle season on the   burger diaper but considering how these buns are  cut i don't really think you need one right now   guys because as you can see they split it down  the middle and they stop right at the very end   so it is catching all the good stuff right there  and you're getting a nice shot of all the crispy   shallot action i got to say guys this looks and  smells fantastic it definitely smells amazing you   can really tell this is some high quality truffle  goodness and i can't wait to get into this i keep   saying it because i got to keep showing it to you  but at the same time i'm digging the softness in   my hand right now and this is just looking pretty  banging you can't tell me it doesn't alright   so finally without further ado it's the black  truffle burger here at shake shack let's do it oh wow you know the fact that they're advertising  that these are real black truffles wild cultivated   in spain guys i gotta tell you right now that  absolutely has got to be correct because the   flavor of this is so up and above and beyond any  type of truffle oil that i've tried in the past it   is so vibrant so rich and earthy at the same time  but when you combine that with the caramelization   of the beef and that gruyere cheese which is just  mild enough guys and plenty of the crispy shallots   that are taking a dive off the front there i gotta  say this is amazing right now the fact that you're   getting it on top to bottom banging let's keep  going in this is freaking delicious right now wow the fried crispy shallots are only  accentuating the black truffle oil itself   here guys and once you combine that with the  caramelization of the beef over here i gotta   say this is amazing i'm only sorry that i  didn't get the double because i gotta say   this is making me hungrier and hungrier and  that's only the second bite the nice softness   of that potato bun a lovely situation but  again the vibrancy of that black truffle oil   is so amazing that sauce is beautiful and this  definitely feels like an upscale situation for   sure guys i mean black truffle is associated  with the upper scale the upper echelon when it   comes to condiments for burgers of course well  for any type of entree i gotta be honest with   you but this is kind of reminding me of the  umami burger that i had way back in the day   with ken domik from kbd productions tv that was  one of my first videos back in the day it's very   similar in flavor i gotta say just overall the  umami of everything i'm experiencing right now   is exploding i mean it really is pretty amazing  and the flavorfulness like i said is pretty insane   the crispy goodness the soft potato bun and the  fact that nothing is falling out the back because   it is definitely being protected this is the way  to do it guys i gotta be honest it really works   amazingly well let's go for another couple  of bites on this i am so glad i'm doing this   and it's even better because it's at night  right now pretty banging let's keep going in you know not only is the vibrancy of the sauce  so banging right now with this the overall   counterbalance i'm getting from the fried shallots  as well as the caramelization of the beef together   you can tell the chefs over at shake shack knew  what they were doing when they were putting this   together because this works so amazingly well and  like i said the counterbalance with the saltiness   goes amazing across the board very earthy in  flavor and the black truffle the fact that   you're getting it on the top and bottom only  adds to the experience so yeah this burger is   definitely not making it home right now guys this  is gonna get killed in the car before i leave here   right now so let's go for one more bite to close  this one out after the rating coming up next but   this is an easy get on over to shake shack right  now and give this one a shot ken that was for you   this is a definitely go out and get it now this  is a banging situation and easy recommendation   but do the double trust me one more  bite we'll finish this one out hang on absolutely top tier with this one across the  board and at the very end of it is the gruyere   cheese which even though it is kind of helping to  hold everything together it's mild enough to just   kind of come through along with the black truffle  goodness guys so you're getting all the flavors of   shake shack in the palm of your hand here with  some crispy shallots to go with and a beautiful   soft potato bun to go with it as well definitely  an awesome burger easily one of my favorites   easily so with that said i'm gonna have to give  the all-new black truffle burger here at shake   shack and easy straight to the top 10 out of 10  guys the only way to make this one better and you   probably know what's coming is add a second patty  to that i mean the shake shack patties are pretty   decent in general but you really need at least  two and i'm only sorry i didn't get the double   it's easily worth the upgrade to go with that  especially with the flavor combination that flavor   profile is insane very vibrant and rich on the  black truffle sauce and i gotta say the overall   quality of it is banging i mean it is organic you  expect it to be pretty solid but it's so vibrant   and it comes out at you quickly it really engulfs  all the other flavors of that burger on top of the   shake shack familiarity really good stuff you know  i gotta say as tasty as this burger is right now   it's only making me that much more curious about  the parmesan garlic fries with that black truffle   sauce which they also have on the menu just to  help celebrate the black truffle season they've   got going over here at shake shack i'm probably  gonna have to bring the wifey down to give that   a shout on top of getting the double variant of  this one because i gotta say it is so freaking   delicious it really is worth your time for real  all right so i'm just gonna very simply ask you   like i usually do are you gonna be giving this  one a shot drop some comments down below and let   me know if you've given this one a go already  and if you have actually tried it already what   did you personally think of it did you try it  as a single and you wished you got the double   drop those comments down below and definitely  let me know and with that this is Ian K closing   out another high quality foodie feature for you  here on peep this out reviews cheaters
