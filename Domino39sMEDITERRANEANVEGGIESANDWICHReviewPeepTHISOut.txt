 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty what's going on everyone welcome back to another  high quality foodie feature for you here on   the channel where this time i'm back on over at  dominos on a sunny yet windy day to check out the   seventh and final sandwich in their current crop  of oven baked sandwiches so without further ado   let's knock out the mediterranean veggie sandwich  and already we're greeted with that toasted artisan   bread action looking very nice on top guys a  little moist looking as well but i'm definitely   digging that baked goodness already let's pop into  these halves here and take a look underneath and   what you're going to find is the most ingredients  out of every single sandwich i've reviewed up   to this point featuring american cheese feta  cheese provolone banana peppers onions roasted   red peppers diced tomatoes and spinach and guys  i gotta say this is looking pretty colorful and   somewhat healthy with the addition of the cheese  being the wild card maybe making it less so but   this looks really really great so let's get into  this one it's the mediterranean veggie sandwich   here at domino's let's peep out this flavor yeah  this is already a lovely situation just in the   artist and bread department guys and like i said  it's got a little moistness on the top there you   can really tell that buttery goodness is lighting  this one up if that stays focused you can see the   glistening on there looking pretty nice and again  all the veggie goodness on the inside of this one   and i'm a huge fan of banana peppers so you know  i am definitely going to be getting into this one   because guys we're doing it we're doing it right  now all right enough talking we're definitely   getting down to business it's the mediterranean  veggie sandwich your dominos let's do it mmm banana peppers and feta sexy combination  and hey even the provolone is getting into   the mix with all the other flavors on this one  guys but i'm really digging the combination of   feta believe it or not it's got that nice tartness  to it it's really adding to this overall and with   those banana peppers and everything else a very  lovely situation as you guys can see there this   one is fairly decent in terms of the filling  and thankfully with about eight ingredients   you'd expect it to be and of course that  toastiness of the bread is coming through   very lovely situation on this and you know what  i don't really mind that there's diced tomatoes   in this right now because the feta itself is  really drowning out everything in the sandwich   on top of the provolone which is very smooth  and rich you can really taste it in the sandwich   and the quality of everything else so far  is really shining the onions the peppers   the banana peppers especially let's go for  another bite on this one it's pretty awesome finally it feels like i've got a filling in  the sandwich compared to the last time out   which if you're curious it's going to be that  buffalo chicken sandwich that i did recently   which you guys are seeing popping up on the  screen here right now that could have used   a lot more chicken with everything else  guys but so far with this i gotta say i am   really digging the overall quality of this one  right now just a beautiful situation and again   let me give you another look at this here  nice and windy today nice and sunny in   southern cali this is a beautiful time to  do this and the colors on this one should   really be popping for you i gotta say this  looks really really great toastiness of that   bread action is pretty amazing let's go for  another bite on this one guys very delicious yeah spinach action banging too you know if  i can make one suggestion on how to improve   this one i'd probably want to see some type of  dressing on this maybe like a mediterranean type   of dressing something almost like italian-like  to give it just a little bit more pop because   honestly that's really kind of what it's missing  all the other flavors are definitely there and   like i said with feta cheese you kind of expect  that to be on anything mediterranean there's a   lot of mediterranean dishes out there that use  feta cheese so i'm glad that it's on here but   guys with the provolone on top of it it's such  an interesting combination it's rich and creamy   tangy at the same time and some nice crunch of  all the other veggies in here and of course the   crunch coming from the toastiness of that bread  so let's go for one more bite on this one then   we'll close this one up after the rating coming  up but guys a beautiful situation to finish out   seven sandwiches that i've checked out over here  at domino's and thankfully i think i may have   seen one of the best for last this is actually  really good one more bite we'll close this one out   well it is super sunny and super windy out today  here in southern cali and i'm definitely digging   that because this is super fun to film right  now so guys coming back to the sandwich for   the mediterranean veggie here at domino's i'm  gonna have to give it a pretty rock solid 9 out of 10 and the only way i can see to improve  upon this one you probably know what's coming   is add a little bit of dressing to that to give  it just a little bit more zip because on its own   the feta is definitely doing a good job that  provolone is amazing and the combination of   all the other veggies on that really shine with  of course the addition of those banana peppers   just a lovely situation guys on that so if you  guys haven't tried this one already i highly   recommend that you do even if you're not quite a  veggie person there is plenty of cheese on that   one to really drown a lot of it out but the banana  peppers made your highlight to go with that cheese   all right so one simple question for you out  of all the seven sandwiches that i've done over   here at domino's now which one is your personal  favorite which one are you looking forward to   trying the most and if you have actually tried any  of them already which is your personal favorite   drop those comments down below and definitely  let me know and with that this is Ian K closing   out another high quality foodie feature for you  here on peep this out reviews on a very sunny and   windy day

veggie mediterranean definitely came  in clutch at the very end and out of all seven   sandwiches this is definitely up there guys a  very very tasty option to go with your dominos   alright everyone
