 hey everyone welcome and welcome  back to the channel it's Ian K   okay real quick i think we can all pretty much  agree that at some point either in the past or   maybe even currently we've all combined  at least one two or maybe three different   mcdonald's items into one i mean quote-unquote  hacking the mcdonald's menu is nothing new   but you know what the fact that they're officially  acknowledging it is so to celebrate they're   actually kicking off four different items that  you can actually customize over here right now   and obviously we're going to take a look at  one of them and judging by the title to this   review i think you know exactly which one it is so  stay tuned because the crunchy double is up next   welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty all right so have you actually had this particular  menu hack already i mean i've definitely had these   separately this is my first time actually all  together in one sandwich officially on camera   with you right now so let's just peep this out  guys feast your eyes on what they're calling the   crunchy double what we've got here is a very nice  situation of mcdonald's classics blended together   with some barbecue sauce i'm definitely thinking  how this looks already so as i'm sure you already   know by now what this basically is is very simply  a double cheeseburger mixed up with some chicken   mcnuggets and some barbecue sauce so of course  you've got the pickle the slivered onions for   that cheeseburger action a little bit of ketchup  and of course the cheese the beef and naturally   the chicken mcnuggets underneath that all white  meat goodness fried up to a crispy golden brown   and then of course drizzle with a little bit of  that barbecue sauce action but i got to say guys   very simple build on this one and apparently  a popular menu hack according to mcdonald's   i mean naturally like i said i've had these  separately in the past just not together all   in one sandwich but you know what it still looks  pretty tasty it's classic mcdonald's goodness let   me just confirm it for you and i have to admit  again i like the presentation i have to admit   the idea of chicken mcnuggets on the very bottom  for that crunch action is looking pretty nice so   here we go the official menu hack over here  at mcdonald's the crunchy double let's do it okay okay you know on the real barbecue sauce  probably wouldn't be my go-to with this one i   think i'm more of a hot mustard type of guy  myself i think that would be a little bit   better just to add a little bit of extra heat  to this overall and just the overall bite that   it would give but the barbecue sauce is nice  and tangy it goes pretty nice guys and again   when you combine that with the beef over here  at mickey d's i can see why a lot of you peeps   may enjoy it this way i mean the flavors like i  said are pretty classic you're getting exactly   what you'd expect with this one the flavor of that  double cheeseburger and the chicken mcnuggets with   the tang of that barbecue sauce so not bad for  that but on the real let me just share something   with you guys if you order this as is just simply  saying you want the crunchy double they're going   to charge you $4.99 over here in southern cali at  least where i got mine but if you go over to the   deal section you can actually get the double  cheeseburger and then a 29 cent second item   which happens to be a six piece chicken  mcnuggets with the sauce that you wanna get   naturally so you can recreate this from the app  and i gotta tell you if you do it direct you're   spending more this was actually about $3.39 for  me right now instead of five bucks that's a much   better deal mickey d's what are you doing there  what are you doing five bucks for this come on   but still i'm definitely digging what this is  naturally it's those classic flavors of mickey d's   let's just keep going in guys because it's tasty  and it's lunch time for me right now let's do it hmm that's pretty fun so is this a blatant cash  grab well maybe just a little bit i have to say   again considering we've been doing this for so  long i think many of us can attest to that right   i mean two three four maybe five items at one time  maybe not that much but you get the point right   at the same time it's nice to see some official  marketing muscle behind it i love the logos i   love the way it looks price points on some of the  other ones are a little up there but at the same   time with this particular one you obviously have  a tip for me right now in that app to get this   a little bit cheaper five bucks borderline  expensive $3.39 not bad let's keep going in you know i have to say texturally this has  some really nice mouthfeel guys aside from   those classic flavors i'm really digging  the overall light crunchiness that i'm   getting from those chicken mcnuggets and of  course the beefy goodness with the cheese   it's not bad and of course with the pickle  action in there a little snap crunch and   acidity to go with everything and a soft bun that  it comes with as well it's kind of hearty when you   have it this way even though i've gotten them  separately and i've eaten them separately and   not putting them together as a sandwich but i  see what they're doing with this one and again   it does look pretty cool like this so yeah i  pretty much knew what to expect from this when   i saw this was one of the options on the menu  but what is your particular menu hack that you   actually like i mean out of the four that's  out there naturally you can put that comment   down below of course but naturally is there  anything outside of that that you usually   get what are some of the main go-to's that you  like to do when you come to mickey d's i'm very   curious to know so drop those comments down below  let's go for another couple on this one real fast mmm pickle very good i didn't do it this time  because i wanted to get it as is for the review   but i usually love to get extra pickle and  extra onions on my double cheeseburgers over   here i just love the extra portion of it  naturally it's really tasty but when you   combine that again with the cheese and all the  beefy goodness it's pretty nice but with a six   piece chaser of the chicken mcnuggets and  in my case hot mustard is gonna be the deal   that's what i'm gonna do the next time i get  this because like i said the extra bite from   hot mustard i think goes extremely well with  chicken mcnuggets combine that with the beef   that's got to be pretty tasty as well especially  in one considering i've had it separately so i'm   definitely digging the presentation on this one  again a little bit of a cash grab for something   i think that people know that's been around for  a very long time but it's fun to have something   like this on the menu quote unquote officially  mickey d's it's definitely cool like that let's   go for one more bite we'll finish this one up with  the rating coming up next but guys super fun to   do and again use that tip do not buy this as is  do the other hack that you actually have in the   deals section of the app it's much better that  way one more bite we'll close it out hang on yup lots of familiar timeless flavor with this  one guys i mean i'm definitely digging the fact   that you can have it all in one as part of a  sandwich so if you like doing stuff like this   obviously you already know what to expect from  it there i guess it just comes down to your   type of dipping sauce for the nuggets but at  the same time super fun to check out and like   i said those flavors are pretty timeless  pretty classic you already know what it is   order the crunchy double by name build it by hand  and hack the mcdonald's menu like i'm about to   so with that said i'm gonna have to get what  they're calling the crunchy double the quote   unquote mcdonald's menu hack over here at mickey  d's a pretty decent   7.5 out of 10 i'm not gonna go much higher than that because  guys like i said this is exactly what you'd   expect it to be the familiar flavors you're just  getting it all at one time as opposed to taking a   bite of the sandwich and then taking a bite of the  nugget with the barbecue sauce it's the same thing   but at the same time it presents pretty decently  and it does look pretty cool i have to admit it   it's kind of fun to eat like that so i see why  some people like that and obviously it is what   it is it's a menu hack right okay so outside of  letting me know which particular menu hack is your   particular favorite i've got one other backup  question for you right now would you actually   pay $4.99 for that if that was the only way to get  that particular one for five bucks would you do it   drop some comments down below and definitely let  me know and with that this is Ian K closing out   another high quality foodie feature
