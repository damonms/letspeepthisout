 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty hey everyone welcome to another high quality  foodie feature for you here in the channel   where this time i'm over a good old bk for an  early look and quickie review of their all-new   brownie batter shake so let's get into it guys  feast your eyes on all the frosty goodness in   front of you here right now this is looking  pretty nice what this consists of is their   vanilla soft serve mixed with fudge brownie  batter and it's got a whipped topping as you   can see they're very very nice and upon closer  inspection it looks like it has maybe little   bits of brownie that are kind of minced in  with it there this is looking pretty good so   without further ado let's peep this  out and see how the flavor is on it mmm very sweet chocolatey more than anything  that's pretty nice let's keep going in you know i would probably say this  is like the essence of brownie   it feels more like a thicker chocolate  i mean it's fudge flavored naturally   but wow that is actually very refreshing  it's very thick let's keep going in oh yeah it almost feels like fine granules  of chocolatey goodness that are mixed in with   this and again very very nice in terms of the  presentation if you look close you can really   see it's really more like a syrup mixture and  of course with their classic vanilla soft serve   goodness here that's the base to go with with this  one and i to say the flavor is on point there and   you have the whipped topping goodness in there as  well so very nice in terms of the overall flavor   but very very sweet i'm still  going in though let's do it man i almost feel like this is too much i mean  for $3.99 this is not a bad deal for the size   but honestly this would probably benefit from  being like a one dollar mini shake that they   did last summer i think i'd probably want to try  that because i think that'd be more of a portion   control cup and overall the sweetness like i said  is really up there i wouldn't feel as bad about   finishing a smaller cup but even still the flavor  is on point and again very fine pieces of brownie   goodness on the inside it's almost like granule  the way you eat flavor is it's really really   nice but fudgy and as it should be because  it's brownie batter after all you know one good thing i like about this also  is the whipped topping they really do   it right over here at bk and i gotta say  with the base being that vanilla soft serve   that's always on point so no matter what you mix  with that you already have a great base to work   from and honestly if you like a lot of chocolatey  goodness heavy fudge type of flavor you're gonna   get that the further i'm getting into this the  more i'm getting that type of flavor so pretty   nice and again for the size $3.99 it's a very  very sizable drink for sure one last one hang on wow really nice but honestly it really feels  more like a hyper chocolate type of shake and   that's okay because i like chocolatey shakes but  considering it's supposed to be brownie batter   let's just say it's a little bit more of the  syrupy chocolate goodness mixed in with their   vanilla soft serve and there's nothing wrong with  that as you can see here guys not bad whatsoever   and again for four bucks for this tall thing  if you can finish this that's not a bad deal   all right so as for the score on this one i'm  gonna have to give the all-new brownie batter   shake here at bk just an okay 7 out of 10  personally for me i'm not really getting brownie   batter in terms of the flavor of a brownie it's  more of like a hyper chocolatey shake and there's   nothing wrong with that because again you're  getting more of the granular type of texture on   the inside so there seems to be something minced  in with it and my guess is it's part of brownies   naturally but even still it's topped off with the  whipped topping which is really nice i really love   the whipped cream on the very top of the shakes  here and the quality is pretty banging because   you already have a solid base to work from with  that vanilla soft serve so not bad in that regard   well let me just say this was a lot of fun to  check out as an early look as an early in the   AM right now i kind of wanted to knock this one  out before the heat kicked in here in southern   cali and i'm so glad that i did because now that i  know the heat is coming it's nice to know that if   you get something like this this is going to kind  of quench your thirst initially but keep in mind   it's very sweet so get a little cup of water  on the side even still but guys a lot of fun to   check out either way all right so now the obvious  question outside of the usual are you gonna give   this one a shot are brownies actually your thing  i mean i'd venture to guess if you've made it   this far into the review they probably are to some  degree but how about in milkshake form like this   drop those comments down below definitely let  me know and with that this is Ian K closing out   another high quality foodie feature for you here  on peep this out reviews bringing you brand new   content every single week here on my channel  so while you stay tuned for that next review   coming real soon in the meantime stay frosty yesir this definitely is begging to be a one dollar   mini shake at some point down the line bk and if  you do decide to do that word of advice keep the   same amount of whipped topping on that new version  if you do it as you have on this version right now   you can never get too much of that whipped cream  goodness this is pretty banging in that regard   alright guys until next time i'll talk to you  soon hey thanks for checking out another one of   my reviews but just in case you didn't see the one  before this one you can find it right up over here   along with what i think youtube's gonna recommend  for you to check out as well as always i think   you'll find something like in both of them and  i'll definitely catch you in the next one see ya
