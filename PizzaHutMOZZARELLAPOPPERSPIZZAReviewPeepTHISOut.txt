 hey everyone welcome back to the channel and today I'm over at Pizza Hut to take a look at their appetizer hybrid pizza mashup so stay tuned because it's up next welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty yesir definitely diggin the return of that nostalgic logo here at Pizza Hut as we check out their mozzarella poppers pizza and I have to say this presentation is not too bad what we've got here is a large pizza one topping is what I got with this one here sausage and it's looking really really nice with all that cheese and all the sausage right there in the middle obviously the big draw with this one 16 mozzarella poppers placed around the edge of this pizza here and it looks like it is 2 per slice each of these poppers looks to feature a nice mix of basil parsley oregano obviously mozzarella cheese we've got Italian seasoning parmesan garlic and onion definitely a laundry's list of Italian goodness here guys but the size looks really good they kind of look like chicken nuggets believe it or not and it looks like these may have been placed on there separately before they bake it but it looks legit it really looks pretty pretty good and as you can see plenty of the sausage in there kind of the more the pellet style not really a super fan of that but it is what it is but plenty of cheese but again it's all about these guys right here is let's see if the flavors are gonna deliver on this one because the presentation so far is looking pretty good it's the mozzarella poppers pizza here at Pizza Hut let's peep ot this flavor oh and how can I forget to mention the dipping sauce this comes with that's right with mozzarella poppers you got to have something to dip those into and in this case we've got marinara sauce and hey I guess it would be marinara because that is the most popular dipping sauce I think personally for mozzarella sticks although I think ranch will be a little bit better and that's just my opinion anyway so let's get into this one but like always before I take that first bite if you guys are fans of high-quality delicious-looking food reviews make sure to hit that subscribe button down below and don't forget to tap the Bell icon so you can be notified as soon as brand new content drops every week guys the mozzarella poppers pizza let me go for a quick bite right in the front of this first give you a little quick breakdown as always of what the pizza is it's a sausage pizza from Pizza Hut and then we'll get into the fun stuff here right after hang on yup it's pretty much that familiar Pizza Hut flavor that I know from the past and even though I haven't had a sausage pizza primarily from here in a long time I'm actually liking the sausage believe it or not even though I'm not really a super fan of the pellets style that these are this is actually a pretty nice situation here guys the cheese is decent but again it's a standard conveyor belt style type of pizza and that's pretty much it but the real draw obviously is gonna be these mozzarella poppers so let me pull one of these off here on the very back and I have to say these are actually very reminiscent of chicken nuggets let me grab this cheese real quick here mmm that's a good situation indeed right there really digging the breading on this one but it almost feels like a Tyson nugget it really does you see if I can kind of break this in front of you real fast here hopefully we've got some type of pull oh maybe just a little bit of mozzarella there as you can see I'm in that bad but let's check out the overall flavor because so far this is very bready I probably should have just bit into it just give it a shot mmm Italian seasoned to death that's what this is there is a lot of seasoning on the breading oh yeah that's actually really tasty mozzarella cheese decent I probably should have taken a bite with the pizza and I think I'm gonna do that next but guys not bad so far all right these are obviously pullaparts but I definitely want to put it on the pizza itself I'm gonna take a bite right down the middle of it right there so you guys can see the cross-section of both and then we're gonna go for a dip into that sauce right after another little quick breakdown let's do it mmm-hmm that's the bite well I'm absolutely impressed with the amount of mozzarella cheese on the inside of these poppers and they definitely satisfy the name of what they are they do pop with cheese there's a lot of nice flavoring with this one the Italian seasoning is coming through and the breading is nice and crisp so as this is cooking up with the pizza it's a nice situation to go in on this guy's but really really tasty like this you know my only complaint went that overall bite is that I wish the bottom of the pizza itself was a little bit toastier I really kind of felt like it wasn't cooked all the way through so I wish it had a little bit more of a crunch to it but the quality is pretty nice on that overall flavor and naturally speaking of quality let's see how this goes with a dip of marinara all right we've got a cup of standard pizza marinara goodness here guys not too thick not too watery and definitely this clings to the coating on the outside of the mozzarella popper pretty nicely let's give it a shot I'm not a fan of that I'm not really a super fan of marinara sauce and I wish this was a little bit hotter if it was gonna be actually with this it's a little on the cold side this really should be served warm to be honest yeah it's just okay I see why they serve it with it not really my go-to probably should have gotten ranch still okay well as far as I'm concerned the only other downside with this one aside from the fact that the crust is not as toasty as I would have liked is the fact that if you do pull the poppers off the very back chances are you're gonna have a nice space of just emptiness right there so you may be missing out a little bit of cheese but as you can see it leaves two little pits right there guys so your mileage may vary with this one but it looks like I'm shorted just a little bit not all the pieces are like this but you can see that the placement definitely affects the overall quality of how much cheese you're gonna have on a slice but hey these mozzarella poppers are a pretty decent size so you are sacrificing a little bit of pizza real estate so to speak for the size of what this is but naturally it would have been nice just to have them just placed on top so it doesn't interfere with the pizza in any way but guys I'm really diggin the quality of what this is let me see if I can kind of focus this in let's go for another crack and as you can see it's kind of cooled off just a bit but a very decent amount of cheese guys if you guys love cheese and I think most of you guys do I think most of you know that I do it very much this is actually a very nice situation and it's definitely a fun hybrid mashup Pizza over here at Pizza not a bad thing to try at least once well as okay as this pizza was and don't get me wrong there's mozzarella poppers we're pretty decent the overall execution of this one may vary for you just a little bit naturally depending upon where these mozzarella poppers fall in the pizza you may have a little bit less real estate so to speak of that good stuff in the middle but as it stands pretty decent for what it is I probably wouldn't get it again like I said but it was fun to check out at least once so with that said I'm gonna have to give the mozzarella poppers pizza here at Pizza Hut just in okay 7 out of 10 like I said the mozzarella itself is really tasty on this one and the fact that it's loaded all throughout the pizza as well is a plus the only downside like I said throughout this is the crust wasn't as toasty as it could have been and the overall execution was a little on the sloppier side and it really kind of deterred a little bit from the slices themselves because of the spaces that it left but still not bad now of course the question is do you guys agree with me right now do me a quick favor drop some comments down below let me know if you've given this mozzarella poppers pizza a shot over here at Pizza Hut and if you have you agree with the overall assessment is it something that you think you'd probably get again drop those comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K closing out another episode of peep this out bringing you brand new content every single week here on my channel so while you stay tuned for that next review coming real soon in the meantime stay frosty not too bad with this one overall Pizza Hut but maybe next time around how about a stuffed crust pizza that you guys are known for with a little bit of chicken nugget action on the edge that will be pretty awesome maybe a side of ranch to go with alright guys until next time I'll talk to you soon but hey real quick before you go and
