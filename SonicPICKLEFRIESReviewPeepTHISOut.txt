 what's going on everyone and welcome or  welcome back to the channel it's Ian K  where today i'm over at sonic america's drive-in  this time to check out the sidekick to their all   new big dill cheeseburger that's right so stay  tuned because i've got the pickle fries up next   welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty wow these smell awesome already guys feast your  eyes on them here we go with the pickle fries over   here at sonic america's drive-in and as you're  gonna see guys a lot of fried crispy goodness   on hand for sure let's break this one down for  you real quick yes sir some pretty awesome fried   goodness for sure guys what we've got here  is a nice little order of dill pickles that   are cut into fry shapes and then battered up and  fried to a crispy golden brown and as you can see   fairly decent in that presentation again they  are looking perfectly golden and judging by the   size of most of these it looks like they have  the length of a standard french fry and i have   to admit again with that aroma being pickle  this is definitely boding pretty well for it   for dipping of course we're going to go in with  some ranch dressing because guys you got to do   that that's like the perfect type of dipping sauce  for anything fried as far as i'm concerned and i   love ranch so i can't wait to do that so yeah  it's looking good and it's smelling good let's   not waste any more time on this one these are  the all-new pickle fries here at sonic america's   drive-in let's peep out this flavor yes sir  i'm totally digging the look of these guys i   mean i love fried food obviously i love pickles  how bad can these really be and again with that   texture looking really nice on that look at that  nice fried action for you this is looking pretty   beautiful let's confirm the goodness hopefully  i have a feeling it's going to be pretty good   these are the all-new pickle fries here at  sonic america's drive-in let's peep this out oh yeah come on you already know   mmm the saltiness of the fried coating on top  of the nice snap that i'm getting from that   pickle that is actually a very lovely situation  guys and take a look on the inside of that there   as it tries to focus in not bad with this  particular one here it's a lot of coating but   very flavorful that pickle spear is pretty nice on  the inside of this pretty tasty let's keep going oh yeah very tasty wow you know just like i  mentioned in my recent review of their all   new big dill cheeseburger here at sonic  which you're probably seeing jumping up   on your screen here right now you don't see  a lot of fast food places that are offering   fried pickles at least something along these  lines like actual fries now i know panera   has got their spicy chicken sandwich that i just  reviewed recently which actually had those chips   this is actually more of the real deal  because guys what you're getting here is   a fully coated spear of dill pickle goodness  and this actually is very very reminiscent   of like a restaurant type of situation and  i'm digging it let's keep going in on these i just love the saltiness of that fried  coating and the brine of the pickle itself   it's really tasty i really like these okay let's  go for a little ranch dressing action over here   because you gotta do that right anything  fried with ranch is a bomb situation for sure   we got a double on this one  here let's go for a little dip   very very lovely situation the  ranch is fairly thick as well   i have a feeling this is going to be just the  accent on top of all the tastiness let's go and it is tangy tart creamy wow and the pickle  goodness on the inside this is really really   tasty wow they needed a lot more of these on  that big dill cheeseburger when i reviewed it   i think it was like three or four on that when  i did it this actually is very nice and again   the quality guys is beautiful on this here so  let's go for another couple on this one we'll   knock this one out a little quickie addendum  review on top of what i just did recently   because i really wanted to get more of these  pickle fries to try them and they're pretty good   definitely really good okay one last bite we'll  wrap the review of the rating coming up next and   guys again tasty fried goodness with ranch pickle  action how bad could this be if you're watching   this right now you probably love pickles like i  do definitely get these they're pretty awesome well i'm definitely getting a fried  zucchini vibe with this but at the   same time i am totally loving the experience  guys it really is very nice in terms of the   pickle flavor just the right amount of  coating and obviously when you pair it   up with that ranch a banging situation an  absolute must try if you're a pickle fan   and if you're this far into the review  i'd venture to guess you already are so with that said i'm gonna have to give the  all-new pickle fries here at sonic america's   drive-in an awesome 9 out of 10 and the only  reason it's not the perfect 10 out of 10 guys is   the price point at $3.59 it's a little pricey  and considering the size of this container   the greasiness and all as you can see here it's  a beautiful situation there it is very very small   that's the only thing so almost four bucks  after tax naturally a little bit much to add   for something like that but at the same time it's  tasty in flavor it delivers on what you'd expect   it to the dill is definitely jumping off of this  one with the perfectly amount of fried coating on   the outside once you pair it up with that ranch  a banging situation like i said price point's   a little high but the flavor is pretty banging on  it all right do me a quick favor if you've already   had the big dill cheeseburger over here sonic  drop some comments down below let me know how many   fries you actually had on the top of yours i mean  how much pickle goodness did you actually get was   it more than three or four pieces and if you've  actually got a separate order of these on the   side do you actually prefer them a la carte over  the burger itself drop those comments down below   and definitely let me know and with that this  is Ian K closing out another high quality foodie   feature for you here on peep this out reviews  bringing you brand new content every single week   here on my channel so while you stay tuned for that next  review coming real soon in the meantime stay frosty   yup yup yup you're already winning with the fried  aspect of these pickle fries right out the gate   sonic and i gotta say with the quality of the  pickles on the inside a nice combo very very   delicious and of course the trifecta with  that ranch banging all right everyone until   next time i'll talk to you soon hey thanks for  checking out another one of my reviews but just   in case you didn't see the one before this one  you can find it right up over here
