 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty alright everyone let's get it it's Ian K back again with another high quality foodie   feature for you here on peep this out reviews  this time over at pizza hut to check out the   first mainstream union between beyond meat and  a national pizza chain so let's take a look at   what that combination has given us as you feast  your eyes on the great beyond stuffed crust pizza   well half of it actually i'll explain in just a  second but as you can see what we've got here is   the beyond italian sausage product all throughout  the top of this pizza guys it's looking pretty   nice and as for the colorful side that's where  the great beyond comes from we've got red onions   banana peppers and roma tomatoes but being you can  also just get this with straight italian sausage i   decided to split it as you can do that on the app  so as you can see here the beyond italian sausage   is right on display for you guys and it looks very  very authentic and hey because this is pizza hut   we have to go in and stuffed crust right so we've  actually got that around the whole pizza here   this is going to be a nice combination of their  goodness on top of all the new goodness to go with   here so guys let's not waste any more time on this  one it's the great beyond stuffed crust pizza here   at pizza hut let's peep out this flavor yesir i  got to admit this looks pretty awesome i mean the   quote unquote italian sausage looks very authentic  and as you guys can see right over there that   is a lovely situation of goodies there as it  tries to focus in on the side but as you can   see it's pretty plentiful and i'm very happy about  that this almost looks like the extramostbestest   italian sausage that i should have gotten from  little caesars but we won't go there right now   but still a very lovely combination of those red  peppers the roma tomatoes and obviously the banana   peppers in there as well really really solid  stuff or red onions i should say there's just   so much color going on here right now this looks  really great okay so before i hopefully confirm   that greatness for you and like always if

new content drops every week alright always a   challenge to do pizza in the car so i'm gonna try  and balance this as good as i can here i'm gonna   pull a nice big slice of the great beyond version  first and obviously like i mentioned earlier   we've got that stuffed crust action let's focus that  in for you take a look at that in the back there   we'll get to that in just a second but guys it  looks very very authentic i'm very impressed   with this so far here we go it's the great beyond  stuffed crust pizza here at pizza hut let's do it mmm vibrant plant-based goodness whoa that's  really good guys the italian sausage is   really authentic i mean look at that you can  actually see the seasoning in there as well too   there it's got kind of like the heartiness when  you're biting down into it like that chew mmm   you'd be hard-pressed to tell me this  was not real italian sausage and man   the quality of the toppings i'm very happy  that they lit this one up ridiculous right now   it really feels pretty substantial considering  the price of this and even though i actually paid   what i paid for it with half the toppings still  the same price we won't go there right now either   but as you can see guys very delicious  let's just keep going in this is pretty bomb oh yeah really good the combination of the red  onions and the banana peppers goes very very   nicely with the italian sausage and i don't think  it's by accident that they do that guys because it   really adds a very distinct flavor profile to the  nice richness of the plant-based italian sausage   which is pretty awesome but as for the back  because this is stuffed crust let me see if i can   try and break this for you there we go no cheese  pull it is what it is but guys i am really loving   the experience of this here right now let's  give this crust a shot real quick hang on you can feel that a nice cheesiness going  into that I need to show that to you real   fast over there definitely lit up pretty nicely  on the inside you got to do stuffed crust if you   go to pizza hut if you have the option with  the promo pizzas naturally if the option is   there take it because it's really pretty bomb but  guys really really good let's just keep going in man i'm probably going to kill a  good chunk of this pie right now   yeah that last bite with that cheesy goodness on  the back here i love how it's kind of thick in the   back of the dough as well so you can really  kind of see it's got something extra in it   and like i've been saying all throughout this  review so far the flavor profile of all the other   goodies on the great beyond version really adds  so much more authenticity just to the overall of   what you're experiencing guys i mean the flavor  is just very very vibrant and when you add that   with the plant-based italian sausage that extra  spicing on top of it is a beautiful combination   so let's go for one more little quick bite at  the very end right over here for that stuffed   crust and we'll get into the standard beyond  italian sausage pizza right after hang on so cheesy well i have a feeling if you  decide to go the standard route with   the beyond italian sausage this is exactly  what you're going to be getting here a very   plentiful amount of that plant-based goodness  and guys again the protein is based upon peas   but you'd be hard-pressed to tell me this was  not italian sausage let's get into this one   oh and hey did i tell you this kind  of reminds me of what i thought the   extramostbestest italian sausage should have  been from little caesars alright let's do it oh yeah oh come on all day long i'm telling you  they could have given me italian sausage and i   would have been perfectly fine with that as well  and this is probably exactly what it should be   the beyond variant but guys i'm not really tasting  any difference with this and considering you can   actually buy this in the stores right now as well  they've had this available for a bit i guess it   was just a matter of time before it was available  in mainstream and one of these types of products   i'm surprised they waited this long but guys at  least we have it i mean that is really really   awesome and again the presentation is killer and i  got to admit it looks very very authentic you can   see the seeds and the spicing everything that's  there is pretty crazy and of course pizza hut come   on guys stuffed crust action right in there let me  go for that quick bite real fast oh yeah hang on oh my god i am diving into this is so good  wow alright i think i pretty much said all   that i possibly can with the exception of one  thing if there's one improvement on this here   is that the crush should have been just a little  bit toastier on the bottom that's really the   only thing but it actually is very tasty guys i  mean it does have some toastiness and naturally   with that goodness right there you can  almost see down that little cylinder   of the cheesy goodness maybe a little bit more  on this side but guys really really delicious   and again the quality of what you're getting here  the beyond italian sausage is no joke the quality   is very high on it it really adds a lot to a pizza  and if you decide to get the great beyond version   you've got so much to enjoy with it with  all the veggies that they have on this one   guys it goes very well so one more bite we'll  finish this one up after the rating but guys   this one is worth your time even if it's  a little on the expensive side let's go in   yeah i think a lot of peeps are going to be  getting this one for sure just for the curiosity   factor alone i mean beyond meat is really known  for their main hamburger meat that's really pretty   much the way i was introduced to it as most of  you guys as well the fact that we're moving into   the italian sausage route right now there has been breakfast versions and things like that available   as well but on pizza like this this is a first  and that really is one of the awesome reasons to   check this one out so with that said i'm going  to have to give the great beyond stuffed crust   pizza A.K.A. just the beyond italian sausage pizza  because we did split it down the middle a very   rock solid 9 out of 10 like i said there's  really no way you can really go wrong with   this one here with the exception of maybe it  not being cooked as much as you'd like you can   probably request it to be toasted more but guys i  got to admit the addition of the stuffed crust on   top of it is just more cheesy goodness to go with  a really really dynamic flavor profile that works   extremely well and again the spicing with that  beyond italian sausage is primo delicious stuff   alright so you obviously know that i enjoy  it but the real question is do you think you're   going to drop some comments down below are you  super excited to give beyond italian sausage a   shot on pizza hut's famous pizza and if you are  are you going to be getting it stuffed crust like   i did right now drop those comments down below and  definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K  closing out
