 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty El Pollo Loco is truly winging it as they kick off 2020 with a new promo featuring one of my favourite hot sauces so let's check out the sweet Tapatio wings here at El Pollo Loco featuring their citrus-marinated whole cut wings tossed in a sweet Tapatio sauce and I have to admit guys these don't look too bad they're pretty much taking up the whole container that they're in here looking really really nice admittedly the sauce looks a little on the light side overall for these two here on the side but for the one over here on the left a very decent amount as you can see it's got a nice red tinge along with this one here we've got their Tapatio fries so it looks like a slight dusting of Tapatio goodness here for a little sweet Heat goodness added to the fries but I'm really diggin how this smells guys and these actually look really really tasty let's see how the quality is gonna be on these because I think the flavor is gonna deliver I'm hoping that it is it's the sweet Tapatio wings here at el pollo loco let's peep out this flavor yeah there is definitely some sweet aroma in my car right now and admittedly guys I have to admit I'm digging the fact that these are whole cut wings I think for presentation purposes it makes it look a lot fuller in the plate at least there especially with those fries so I'm very excited to get into this right now but before we do and like always if you guys are fans of high-quality delicious looking food reviews make sure to hit that subscribe button down below and don't forget to tap

really really nice they give this a shot and they are very meaty as you can see there guys let me go put a little drumette real fast let me pull this off and give this a go here we go I'm very excited let's do it mmm oh yeah oh Wow that is some strong heat I like it I like it a lot I don't know about Tapatio in terms of the flavor but the overall heat that I'm getting is absolutely there so for marketing they obviously have the name but I got to say the sweetness is really what's selling this on top of the heat coming up right after as well so really really tasty initially you'll get that sweetness right up front and then the heat begins to really kick in and then it really begins to ramp before pulling back but guys very tasty this is probably gonna be a better visual for you since that drumette is mostly gone but as you can see a very very nice chicken wing here guys the full deal with a very decent amount of that sauce on the outside that glaze is really nice it's really sticking to it but it's very potent and I really like that really tasty stuff my hands are completely lit up right now and that's not a bad thing absolutely considering how tasty the sauce is and admittedly like I mentioned earlier again I really thought the sauce was a little light on a couple of the pieces here but the little that I have on those I got to admit it's gonna go a long way because it is so vibrantly potent so I guess it's true for some things when they say a little goes a long way so let me pull off the very end of this one here and I'm gonna try and take this down one bite at a time here here we go hopefully I can get this going you'll start from the very back let me try this chicken wing whole let's give it a shot mmm almost almost Wow these are so tasty mmm but hey a word to the wise definitely bring plenty of napkins because they are very very sticky and their wings you're gonna be eating them with your hands anyway I think you know that either way let's give these Tapatio fries a shot I'm really diggin a textural look at this one they've got the skin on them so they're the natural cut style one of my favorites with the Tapatio dusting let's see how that is mmm okay the saltiness is nice not really getting too much heat but more sweetness than anything else yeah they're not bad but I'm not really getting anything that tells me that these are like Tapatio like we've got some sweet heat that matches the type of chicken flavor of course and I don't think it can because this is just a side item but it would have been nice if these were just a little bit more flavorful but they're okay for what they are the amount of dusting seems pretty even across the board as well so that's actually not a bad thing either so you're getting a nice bit of flavor so they definitely don't taste like regular fries and I got to say guys this is actually my very first time trying the fries here at el pollo loco so I think I'd probably get these without anything anyway because the quality of what they're serving here I think is decent on its own but for a little bit of sweetness this is actually not too bad at all and like I said they've got that skin on them and that's actually one of my favorite things about these pretty good all right so before we wrap this one up let's take a look at another one of these wings and this one is actually a lot more saucier on the bottom and it is on the top guys but it's still meaty nonetheless and the flavorfulness of that sauce is on point these whole cut wings really do make a difference and it's like you're getting a couple of wings per so even though I've got a three piece here it's actually six because we've got three drumettes and three of the standards so very very nice stuff so with that said I'm gonna have to give the all new sweet Tapatio wings here at el pollo loco a pretty rock-solid 9.5 out of 10 the only thing that really hurts this one at least based upon my opinion anyway is the fact that the sauce itself wasn't as evenly as distributed as I personally would have liked but what you do get is super flavorful I just think from my order today they were kind of thrown in very quickly without really making sure they were ultra coated but as it stands still very flavorful they definitely bring that heat and with those fries on the side the natural cut style absolutely I'm diggin those guys I just wish those were just a little bit hotter but aside from that still very good but of course the obvious question at least to me anyway is did these citrus-marinated whole cut sweet Tapatio wings bring the goods for you right now drop some comments down below what did you think of the overall presentation of this one today and now that I think about it are you generally a wing person to begin with drop those comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K closing out another episode of peep this out bringing you brand new content every single
