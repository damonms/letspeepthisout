 what's going on everyone and welcome or  welcome back to the channel it's Ian K   where today i'm headed into taco bell to check out  the return of a true fan favorite menu icon that's   right and i'm going in on a different version  of it too and as you already know guys it's   the veggie mexican pizza but first things first  let's set ourselves up through that drive-thru   welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty hi how are you give me a second sure no problem  thank you for waiting what can i get started for   you yeah peep this out i've got a mobile order  pick up for Ian for a veggie mexican pizza with   black beans please great thank you well this  should be a lot of fun because i figured after   checking it out the very first time about a couple  of years ago right before they took it away i said   to myself if i ever do this again let's do  something different with it and being that   i'm always down with the black beans over here at  taco bell let's just say i have high hopes for it yeah awesome thank you awesome thanks so much  appreciate it stay frosty take care buh-bye all   right guys let's peep this out well i gotta say  i'm really digging the new packaging on this so   far guys i mean it looks nice and bright and it  looks like they're really showing some respect to   a true menu icon that apparently has been around  since 1985 guys i was 12 years old when this   came out pretty crazy so without further ado let's  get into it it's gonna look very familiar to me of   course there you go it's the mexican pizza here at  taco bell the veggie variant and i gotta say guys   it looks just like i thought it was going  to let's break this one on down real fast   all right so right off the break we've got two  crispy flour tortillas aka the pizza shells and   it looks like it's topped off with a very nice  blend of three cheeses along with some diced   tomatoes and guys of course the mexican pizza  sauce for sure on the inside of this one normally   it comes with refried beans but i decided to go  with black beans and that's definitely a favorite   over here at taco bell for sure as well but still  what we've got here is a very simple ingredients   list but a very nice looking presentation  as far as i'm concerned and the cheese on   the top is looking pretty nice fairly melted  although i do wish it was just a little bit more   but still it looks alright and the diced tomatoes  on top do add a little bit of additional color   so that is pretty cool all right guys let's  not waste any more time on this one this is   the veggie mexican pizza here at taco bell let's  peep out this flavor yes sir lots of that gooey   three cheese blend on the top of this one guys  nice and gooey looking very nice all right let   me pick up one of these here and we'll get this  one going and here it is very familiar minus the   beef but the black beans do look pretty fantastic  on this very crispy in my hands as well too here   we go it's the veggie variant of the mexican  pizza here at taco bell let's peep this out the black beans so robust in flavor   that's good it's really good actually goes really  good with that pizza sauce aka the mexican pizza   sauce very nice yeah those crispy flour tortillas  aka the pizza shells are giving me a little bit of   a flautas type of vibe guys this is actually  feeling like it's got a little bit more of   like a filo dough situation it's a little bit  extra crispy but really really nice and with   the black beans as well a lovely situation  and of course with that cheese on the top   the classic three cheese blend over here very  nicely done let's go in front of the few on this oh yeah tasty so yeah i'm glad to be checking out  this version of the mexican pizza considering i   did the beef variant the last time around and it  was kind of funny because when i did that review   two months later they announced that  this was going away permanently and   now we have a huge hype to bring this back  even though it's been on the menu forever   but guys i think it's all about the packaging  which i think looks really cool again i love   the whole established 1985 vibe but still  this is still pretty tasty guys lots of   goodness over here but with the black  bean variant for veggie people out there   it's nice to have the option and i'm glad  they're doing that because naturally you want   to have more options on the menu right this is  a pretty solid one let's go for another couple it's good and you know what's also good about this  is the veggie variant is about 460 calories so i   think it's about 100 or so calories less than  the regular one about the average amount for   pretty much any fast food item out there most of  the burgers go for about 500 to 600 calories and   usually but with this being 460 it's pretty much  within the same range but you're getting a lot of   nostalgic goodness with this one on top of all  the other flavors that you know from taco bell   naturally but i gotta say that pizza sauce the  mexican pizza sauce it's more of like a tomato   puree type of thing it feels like it's elevated  but guys it goes very well with everything on   here as you'd expect it to and hey it's tasty  familiar taco bell flavor with a little bit of   an extra crispiness in those crispy shells the  pizza shells they seem a little bit different   this time around again more of the flautas type  of vibe like a phyllo dough type of situation but   it's nice and crispy and i'm definitely digging  it one more bite we'll close it out hang on well it's great to know this one's back on the  menu permanently and considering they're really   pushing it with the veggie version on top of  the regular version of it as well i'm definitely   going to be customizing it with black beans  going forward even though this could have been   done the first time around you got to love the  marketing hype machine behind this one but still   very tasty taco bell goodness and obviously the  packaging is really selling this one pretty nice well this one's definitely going to get  a couple of extra points because of the   black bean situation guys i mean naturally it's a  little bit of an above average type of product in   general the flavor is pretty decent but with the  addition of the black beans it's really adding to   the overall experience so with that said i'm  gonna have to give the veggie version of the   mexican pizza featuring black beans here at taco  bell a pretty awesome   8.5 out of 10 solid goodness on that one guys and again with  the addition of the black beans instead of beef   you have another awesome option to go in on and  choice is king choice is definitely warranted   you really want to have some options when  you customize this one officially on the menu   that is a pretty good one definitely worth  checking out with the black beans alright so   for all you peeps who screamed from the rafters  shortly after i dropped my review on the original   variant of the mexican pizza a couple of years ago  do a quick favor drop some comments down below let   me know how excited you are to have this one back  officially on the menu after they quote unquote   took it away permanently the last time around  and what did you think of this variation with   the black beans drop those comments down below and  definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K   closing out another high quality foodie feature  for you here on peep this out reviews bringing   you brand new content every single week here on  my channel so while you stay tuned for that next review   coming real soon in the meantime stay frosty  yeah i definitely dig the packaging on this one   i may just have to get an empty box for the studio  alright guys until next time i'll talk to you soon   hey thanks for checking out another one  of my reviews but just in case you didn't   see the one before this one you can find it  right up over here along with what i think   youtube's gonna recommend for you to check  out as well as always i think you'll find   something to like in both of them and i'll  definitely
