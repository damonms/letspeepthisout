 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty hey everyone welcome back to another high quality  foodie feature for you here on the channel where   this time i'm over a good old blaze pizza to go  in on the latest variation of their all-new cheesy   bread and let's just say if you peeps are down  with pesto i'm thinking this one's gonna be right   up your alley so let's get into it feast your  eyes on their all-new pesto garlic cheesy bread   and already guys that aroma in the car is lighting  up beautifully a very lovely situation here and a   lovely presentation of that what we've got here is  their classic pizza dough topped off with shredded   mozzarella oregano chopped garlic and then it's  finished off with a pesto drizzle and i got to   say guys it is very strong in that department the  garlic and the pesto is coming along beautifully   and for dipping it looks like this one is paired  up with two containers of their pizza sauce so   guys a lovely situation but again the flavor  i think this one's gonna deliver is gonna be   pretty awesome because the aroma is definitely  setting me up for some good stuff here i think   so let's not waste any more time on this one  it's the all new pesto garlic cheesy bread here   at blaze pizza let's peep out this flavor yeah  buddy this is feeling like an artisan situation   here guys with the way that pesto drizzle is all  across the top of this here right now i'm really   digging that and it looks like every single piece  has got a little bit of something on here guys a   very lovely situation at least in the presentation  department but like i said i think the flavor is   going to be pretty awesome on this so let me  pull up one of these pieces here real quick   we'll get into it and again the aroma in my car  is ridiculous right now i am definitely digging   that wow this looks really good take a look at  this guys as it begins to focus in there you go   take a look at that pesto action the mozzarella  cheese action the garlic is really lighting   up beautifully and again the toastiness is pretty  awesome as well this looks perfectly cooked   right now so here we go it's the all new pesto  garlic cheesy bread at blaze pizza let's do it garlic and pesto right away you knew this was going to be good right  i think i just confirmed it for you   you know i got to be honest my taste buds  are kind of fighting to decipher what i like   the best about this so far and honestly i think  it's going to start off with the garlic because   the garlic is pretty strong the chopped  garlic is pretty amazing over here blaze   when you dovetail the flavor of that with the  pesto drizzle itself here guys and then the nice   light oiliness that i'm getting from the  mozzarella cheese all those combinations are   working really really in unison with each other  and then you have the nice toastiness of the crust   let's go for another bite we'll give you some  more close-ups but guys this is pretty good and if i can just come back to the classic dough  real quick here as you can see again it is cooked   perfectly guys just the right amount of toastiness  to complement all the good stuff that you're   seeing right over here i am really loving the  amount of mozzarella cheese on this and again the   chopped garlic the oregano actually is beginning  to come through as well as the pesto of course a   very lovely situation and honestly guys i had a  feeling it was going to be that way considering   the prep look pretty great on this guys as you're  seeing on the screen here right now it's the same   standard way they made the last cheesy bread  that i reviewed here on the channel but again   all the mozzarella goodness that's being dumped  onto this is always a beautiful situation to start   it's followed up naturally with a little bit  of garlic or in this case a lot of garlic it's   pretty much all across the top before it's thrown  into the oven for about maybe 180 seconds or so   and the next thing you know it is good to go  they take it out drop it on their little cutting   board area slice it up and then drizzle it with  the good stuff guys that pesto is pretty nice   and after all those rapid fire clips that  you just saw right now it comes out to be   the awesomeness that i'm holding in my hand  here right now and again the size of this   is pretty awesome guys i'm really digging it's  basically like a half pizza tray they put this   in if you decide to eat maybe half of what  you get normally they put it in those boxes   it looks great all right enough talking  let's keep going down to business on this   one because we're definitely going to get into  some pizza sauce in just a second here hang on so let's go into said pizza sauce guys and  as you can see nice and thick goodness to   go with this one here it's almost like having  a cheese pizza but dipping into it naturally   here with the sauce lovely situation  let's do this and do this we shall mmm the robustness of that garlic as well  as the flavor of the pesto is really holding   its own against the pizza sauce guys and again  the combination is a nice one i gotta say this   goes very very nicely here let's keep going in  man so cheesy well i gotta say i'm definitely   enjoying myself checking out this new variation  of the cheesy bread compared to the very first   version that i did that came out a few months  back and as you're probably seeing jumping up   on your screen here right now it was a lot of  fun to check out just by my expression alone   in the thumbnail so as fun as that review was to  film a few months back guys i'm really digging   this version of it better because i love garlic  personally and pesto is pretty awesome the only   major difference with this compared to the last  one is the addition of chopped garlic and pesto   and instead of an olive oil drizzle that pesto is  replacing it naturally but guys super delicious okay so because i really want to let's go for  one more dip with this here guys because i am   thoroughly enjoying myself here and we'll give you  one last close-up of this here in just a second   but i gotta say guys a lovely situation let's  go for that sauce a nice nice combination a   nice pairing overall hopefully that's staying in  focus for you there we go guys lovely situation   indeed one more bite we'll close this one up  after the rating guys super delicious stuff all right i lied let's go for one more  close-up because guys you can never get   too many glory shots of the cheese on this  guys a very liberal amount of the mozzarella   goodness the lovely toastiness on the bottom  and that oregano chopped garlic and that pesto   action on the top is just a beautiful accent  to really take this one up a notch that pairing   with the pizza sauce a beautiful situation guys  delicious stuff all around over here blaze pizza   yeah you can fade a heaping mound of mozzarella  cheese on top of some fresh pizza dough guys and   like i said that was made pretty perfectly  right now the flavors of everything really   stood out especially in the garlic department  and overall it was a very awesome cheesy bread   eating experience right now i got to tell you  guys super fun to check this one out today   so if you really need me to confirm it for you  right now i'm going to have to give the all new   pesto garlic cheesy bread here blaze pizza the  obvious 10 out of 10 guys this was made perfectly   today the flavors were jumping out of me all  across the board and i got to say guys a very   lovely toasty situation and a very decent portion  size i got to admit as well on top of two dipping   sauces you're pretty much covered in that regard  just a pretty banging value overall and generally   some of the best cheesy bread that i've tried  as of late and i gotta say really really nice   in terms of the quality of the ingredients  that makes a huge difference with this one   all right so i'm willing to bet that if you've  made it this far into the review you're probably   gonna be giving this one a shot so if you've  got blaze pizza in the area and you do give it   a go what did you personally think of it drop some  comments down below if you've tried the original   variation of the cheesy bread back in the day  which do you prefer that version or this new
