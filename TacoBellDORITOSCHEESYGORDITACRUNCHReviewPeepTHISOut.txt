 what's going on everyone and welcome back to  another high quality foodie feature for you   here on the channel where i've returned to  taco bell this time to check out the return   of a fun menu favorite that i've never tried  until right now that's right you already know   what it is it's the doritos cheesy gordita  crunch so stay tuned because it's up next   welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty so here we go with the returning  doritos cheesy gordita crunch my   first time going in on this one and i  have to say the presentation is looking   pretty hefty and considering the ingredients in  this one you're about to find out exactly why   all right so what we've got here is their famous  doritos nacho cheese taco shell on the inside and   on the outside of it is actually a slightly crispy  gordita flatbread like outer shell that's actually   separated with a three cheese blend so we've got  a little bit of glue to hold these things together   and on the inside of that doritos nacho cheese  taco shell we've got some seasoned ground beef   some spicy ranch some shredded lettuce and some  shredded cheddar cheese on the very top guys and   i have to say again it looks pretty substantial  and i have to admit for the close to five dollar   asking price for this i would expect nothing  less this is actually looking and smelling   pretty great actually all right so let's see  if all these flavors are gonna deliver this   is the returning doritos cheesy gordita crunch  here at taco bell let's peep out this flavor   yes sir this definitely presents pretty well  guys i have to admit that flatbread like outer   gordita shell is a lovely situation lightly crispy  it's got some softness to it at the same time and   it feels a little powdery in the hand and on the  inside the doritos nacho cheese taco shell looking   really really nice and plenty of that seasoned  beef and again very substantial in the hand for   close to five bucks like i said i really am glad  this is actually filling out my hand pretty nicely   it feels pretty good all right let's confirm the  goodness for you with this one guys my first time   like i said going in on it it's the returning  doritos cheesy gordita crunch let's do it right off the break the nice softness of that  gordita shell is really lighting this one up   already guys it kind of precursors everything  that you're getting into here and then all the   regular taco bell flavors begin to come through  with a little bit of the doritos action on the   very end right over there very nice in terms of  the ground beef this one is pretty packed and   plenty of the cheese is actually in the middle of  this one separating the nacho cheese shell and the   gordita shell very lovely right there the nice  spiciness that i'm getting from the spicy ranch   and of course the accents of the lettuce and the  extra shredded cheddar cheese in the top is only   dovetailing further into this one to give you even  more of that flavor that you'd expect from this   this is pretty great but still very carby at the  same time i mean of course you're going to expect   that right you have the outer gordita shell  you have the crunchy taco shell on the inside   so you're already expecting it to be a little  bit high in that category but all the regular   flavors are beginning to come through and again  guys i'm really digging the softness of it here   i don't really have gorditas too often but i have  to admit it goes amazing when you combo it up with   that doritos nacho cheese shell here it really  is one of the signatures on taco bell's menu   and i'm glad that it's back this really is the  preferred way i think to have one of these things   and i gotta say if i do get this one again which  i'm probably going to this is how i'm gonna do it   because being that we don't have the double  cheesy gordita crunch which actually came out   about three or so years ago back in the menu over  here this is actually the next best thing because   you're getting a really really solid amount  of food either way but with the familiarity   of the doritos locos taco which is pretty nice  so let's keep going in guys this is pretty tasty that's really good let me turn this one sideways  so you can see a little bit more of the layers   and as you can see there is no shortage of the  seasoned beef over here at taco bell it's their   signature in terms of the protein for sure it's  very unmistakable for what it is when you're   having it the spicy ranch goes amazing with it  and honestly with the shredded lettuce and the   capper with that shredded cheddar cheese a very  nice combination there's really no nacho cheese   sauce that's needed with this one and essentially  what you're getting that is in between the actual   gordita shell and the doritos nacho cheese taco  shell itself so that combination still is there   but i gotta say the prevalent flavors on this  one is easily going to be the actual meat itself   along with the spiciness of that ranch and of  course the softness and the crunch that you're   getting from the outer shells pretty nice stuff  here all right and because i got some hot sauce   this time out we're going to go in on some  diablo action right now just to give this a   shot with the flavors problem solved let's crack  this open real quick and we'll give it a shot   i'm really digging the way that this looks guys  this is really nice so let me try and keep this   focus as much as possible get it all along here  there we go some lovely action i'm usually more   into the fire sauce myself but i figured you know  what let's just go big we're going big with one of   these right now let's go for the top gun sauce  let's give it a shot here we go with the diablo mmm the heat is not crazy on this i like it though  it's like a kicked up fire sauce but it's good   yeah this just feels like a little bit of a  kicked up fire sauce it's nothing crazy and   considering the weather's cooler right now here in  southern cali i'm not minding it at all but still   guys a very lovely situation with this one and  i gotta say i'm glad i gave this one a shot for   the taco bell playlist here on the channel this is  definitely a very tasty alternative to the regular   gordita and a very easy recommendation especially  with the doritos nacho cheese taco shell it really   makes this one and adds just another layer  of nacho cheesiness at the very end of it   even though all the other dominant flavors are  really kicking this one up this is easily worth   your time and i think pretty much worth the asking  price pretty tasty order ahead and pick yours up   at our contactless drive-through so yeah just  a little quickie review and breakdown of the   returning yet new for me doritos cheesy gordita  crunch and i gotta say guys again i'm glad to have   given this one a shot because while it's not the  quintessential taco bell item on the menu because   it's missing sour cream and the tomatoes and the  things that you'd probably expect to find anyway   the spicy ranch is a nice add-on to that and  thankfully the cheese that it actually has in the   very bottom that separates the gordita shell and  the nacho cheese taco shell i gotta say it really   works out pretty nicely guys it's just enough  but it really highlights the other flavors in   that one so still i think it is pretty much worth  the asking price a very tasty item especially with   some of that diablo sauce pretty good so with  that said i'm gonna have to give the doritos   cheesy gordita crunch here at taco bell an easy  8 out of 10 guys very tasty across the board and   like i said all those flavors from taco bell minus  the sour cream and the tomatoes are coming through   pretty nicely their spicy ranch is always a  favorite and the duality between the softness and   the crunch goes pretty nicely and again the name  brand doritos goodness at the very end is a little   bit of the accent on top of the garnishment of the  shredded cheddar cheese on the top pretty tasty   all right so outside of the obvious of me asking  you if you're gonna be giving this one a shot do   me a quick favor drop some comments down below let  me know how excited you are to give this variation   of the classic gordita a shot over here at taco  bell are you gonna be upgrading the taco shell on   the inside with that doritos goodness drop those  comments down below and definitely let me know   and with that this is Ian K closing out another  high quality foodie feature for you here on   peep this out reviews bringing you brand new  content every single week here on my channel so   while you stay tuned for that next review coming real soon  in the meantime stay frosty yes sir pretty tasty   on this one guys and i gotta say this doritos  cheesy gordita crunch is definitely fitting   for the season i mean considering halloween is  right around the corner just look at the orange   goodness in this one here right now it kind of  fits if you ask me and again the color duality   is looking pretty awesome on it pretty tasty all  right
