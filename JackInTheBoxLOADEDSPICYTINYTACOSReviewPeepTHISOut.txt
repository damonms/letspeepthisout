 hey everyone welcome back to another high quality  foodie feature for you here on the channel   cheaters cam style after hours over a good  old jack-in-the-box this time to check out the   loaded version of their all-new spicy tiny tacos  and they're definitely looking pretty tasty so   stay tuned because they're up next welcome to  peep this out reviews with ian k stay frosty we're loaded after hours here at jack-in-the-box  with their all-new loaded spicy tiny tacos and   right off the bat guys you're going to notice the  striking red coming off of those little mini tacos   there very very cool on the outside of those  corn shells definitely a very cool presentation   all right so what we've got here is a 15 piece  order of their new spicy tiny tacos featuring mini   corn tortillas dusted with spice and then filled  with a chicken and spice mixture and as you guys   can see the striking red dusting on the outside  is very cool looking it really does stand out   and to make this loaded it's topped off with  a very generous amount of shredded lettuce a   cheddar cheese sauce and taco sauce on top of  that so guys we've got a little extra flavor to   go with everything else on here and again the  combination is striking and just because i had   to get some on the side we've got more of that  creamy avocado lime sauce definitely one of the   best sauces to pair up with these tiny tacos and  it goes amazingly well in the flavor department   i can't wait to get into that so let's do just  that this is the all new loaded spicy tiny tacos   here at jack in the box let's peep out this  flavor 15 pieces get them regular or loaded   well in true jack fashion it looks like what i've  got here is definitely a hot mess of goodness guys   hot meaning the spiciness that's on the inside of  this and obviously a hot mess because of the way   that it looks but even still a cheddar cheese  sauce along with taco sauce shredded lettuce   on top of the spicy tiny tacos how bad could this  really be presentation wise again it's very cool   in the container that it's in and the striking red  and everything it's got going with it here really   does stand out even more so than the last time  around with the regular versions of those tiny   tacos so i'm already digging the way this looks  already all right enough chit chat for now let's   pull one of these up here and give this a shot and  i want to get a little bit of everything here and   obviously with the cheddar cheese sauce it's  actually way more plentiful towards the bottom   guys take a look at that action right there  you can kind of see that chicken mixture on   the inside that combination a little bit of  everything there let's give it a shot it's   the all new loaded spicy tiny tacos here jack  in the box after hours naturally here we go oh man already that taco sauce mmm the  cheddar cheese sauce with it as well wow   here comes the heat whoa i'm scrambling around  for my water and thankfully i'm prepared hang on the heat is no joke on this and you know what  the taco sauce itself has actually got a little   bit of heat on its own so that's adding to  the overall fun of what we've got here guys   and again take a look at that action right  there it's a wet spicy tiny taco but that   taco sauce is adding so much to this right now  very very lovely on this let's keep going in these are so addictive they're very good there's  something about that puree type of mixture on   the inside of this there obviously it's very much  like the tacos that they have over here in general   in fact it's exactly like that take a look at  that review popping up on your screen right now if   you want a little refresher course and what's in  the jack-in-the-box tacos these are really tasty all right so let me go for a little bit more  of that cheesy action here on whoa here we go   this is gonna be the one take a  look at that action right there   that is straight out loaded two of them in effect  here right now guys very lovely situation on this   let's give it a shot i'm  taking this down in one bite all day long wow that taco sauce on top of the  spicy tacos themselves well hang on one second super strong super super strong lovely situation  all right let me go into this right now the creamy   avocado lime sauce i can only imagine how it's  going to dovetail with all the other flavors and   like i was trying to say with the taco sauce  it adds such a vibrancy of flavor in addition   to what i'm having here already but i can only  imagine mixing it up with some of that creamy   avocado lime sauce let's get this set up all right  let's get this going real fast here and before i   get this going officially let me give you a look  on the inside as you can see nice little spices   mixed in with this it's got the little avo action  right there kind of greenish just a little bit   based upon my view and i have to say i am excited  to give this a go and let's just do just that   i got to do this very very carefully right now  i'm going to try and pour a little of this on here   see how this goes if we can kind of  make some contact okay here we go   there it is trying to do this ultra carefully  in the car let's give this a shot here we go whoa the lime is strong man and  the heat is even stronger hang on sexy very sexy wow okay let me grab one of  these up by themselves because i really want to   and i've got a little bit of  taco sauce action on here as well   and be very careful with this all right  a little bit of that action some of the   loaded variation as you guys can see trying  to keep that focus right there i'm telling you   the creamy avocado lime sauce is such a bomb  addition with this let's give this a go again all day long all day long or all night long  actually this is so good all right let's go for   one more to knock off this half over here i'll  give you another shot of the container itself   again i'm gonna close this one out here  soon but guys another lovely situation   just delicious stuff after hours here at  jack and again with the creamy avocado lime   sauce and all the loaded action on these  spicy tiny tacos banging truly banging well we started this after hours review with a  shot of a hot mess up close and we're ending it   off the same way only more so as you can see guys  this is a crazy amount of goodness in front of you   here right now and while it's not much to look at  actually when you look at it like this the flavor   is definitely on point but again the striking corn  on the outside of those spicy tiny tacos really   deliver the goods in the heat department and it's  a very nice combination of flavors all around with   the cheddar cheese sauce of course with the taco  sauce and the lettuce for a little bit of crunch   a little soggy still but guys really really great  stuff all around and an after-hours thing that's   really fun to check out for you right now truly  banging try my new spicy tiny tacos only a jack   in the box so with all that said i'm going to have  to give the loaded variant of these all new spicy   tiny tacos here at jack in the box a rock solid  9 out of 10 i have to say right off the bat guys   with the addition of that cheddar cheese sauce the  lettuce and the taco sauce it adds such additional   dimensions and flavor to what's already very  flavorful to begin with and with the heat being as   crazy as it is believe me that's not all for looks  the look of those tacos being as red as they are   may be dyed with color but what's in it is  definitely elevated in spice and when you combine   that with the three ingredients added to this  one to make it loaded you've got a very lovely   situation add in that creamy avocado lime sauce  and you've got definitely a winner of a situation   here guys very delicious stuff all right so i've  got one simple question and it goes out to all   the jackheads out there that have got jack in the  box in the area if you've tried both versions of   these all new spicy tiny tacos the loaded variant  and the standard one naturally drop some comments   down below which did you actually prefer out
