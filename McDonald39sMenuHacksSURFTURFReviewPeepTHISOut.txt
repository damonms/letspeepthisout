 hey everyone welcome or welcome back to the  channel it's Ian K so just when you thought it was   safe to head on over to mcdonald's to hack some of  the items off of their menu surprise now they've   got four official hacks available on the menu for  a limited time only so of course you already know   i'm checking out another one of them so stay  tuned because the surf plus turf is up next   welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty alright so let's jump right on in because i  definitely want to peep this out guys feast   your eyes on the featured menu hack for  this review the surf plus turf and i gotta   say the combination of what you're looking at  here with these two classics together is one   it's really looking pretty cool it's kind  of giving me a big mac vibe but even still   i am definitely digging what i've got in my hands  here right now okay so just in case you don't know   what this one already has what we're starting out  with here is a double cheeseburger featuring two   beef patties cheese ketchup mustard pickles and  diced onions and they're fusing it with a filet   of fish which is basically the crispy fried fish  fillet along with cheese and tartar sauce but when   you combine the two together there you go the  surf plus turf fish plus meat and i gotta say   guys the combination looks like it's gonna work  pretty nicely because there's a lot of differences   in terms of the flavors with these two together i  mean come on now who has actually ever had really   tartar sauce on a burger before i'm actually kind  of curious to see how that combination is going   to go and when you combine that with the filet of  fish the classic goodness over here again pretty   nice in terms of the presentation it's kind of  pseudo big mac vibe still because of that middle   layer of the bun let's just give it a shot guys  here we go my first official time trying this hack   officially on the menu right now it's the surf  plus turf over here at mcdonald's let's do it mmm that surprisingly works wow well right off the  break i'm getting a lot of beefy flavor because   really the double cheeseburger is the dominant  flavor in this along with the cheese so the beefy   flavor is coming up front along with that cheesy  goodness and then it dovetails right into the fish   right after that with a little bit of that light  tartar sauce that i'm getting at the very end   but of course that's slightly overpowered  with the ketchup for me but the combination   surprisingly works pretty nicely guys i mean  just take a look at this pseudo big mac vibes   only because of the size and the denseness of it  but at the same time i'm really digging the fact   that we have two of these proteins together and  of course there's sandwiched with all the cheesy   goodness here so like i said this surprisingly  works for me my first time giving this a go   and i have to say i'm digging the experience so  far and speaking of the experience this one is   actually part of an exclusive app promo which  gives you medium fries and a medium drink along   with this combo right over here for $8.18 at least  here in southern cali so you're basically getting   the fillet of fish for $5.19 and then $2.99 for the  double cheeseburger so there's no promo pricing   for this whatsoever mcdonald's i see what you're  doing here but at the same time it would have   been nice but this time around because you're  throwing in medium fries and a medium drink for   the same price that's not bad so the best value  is easily going to be with this one and again   that combination here this is pretty much  designed to fill you up on top of those   fries and that drink naturally guys i am  really digging the overall process of how   this is working out for me right now and it's  definitely fun to review let's keep going in it works here's a better cross-section shot to  give you all the layers of the goodness with this   one guys starting off with that familiar flavor  from that classic double cheeseburger guys it's   unmistakable over here mcdonald's when you bite  into it you already know but combining that with   the flakiness of the fish i have to say works  very nicely and the tartar sauce is not really   doing too much overall it's very lightly there in  the background because the ketchup and the cheese   is kind of overpowering this one for me but lots  of nice beefy flavor and a very solid combination   of this one pretty cool well i'm definitely  glad to have given one of these new menu hacks   a shot over here at mickey d's because this one  actually feels like a true hack because this is   not something that you're going to be eating at  the same time normally the last review that i did   on the crunchy double is pretty much something i  think you would do normally i mean just putting   a few chicken mcnuggets into a cheeseburger is  pretty much a no-brainer if you have those two   together just to try it although that was my first  time trying that one on camera officially this is   not something that i would actually do on my own  so this is a real hack for me right now because   it's my first time going in on two particular  sandwiches that i would never buy together   at the same time right now on camera with you  so pretty cool with this one again i do like   the presentation of it it's hearty the best deal  with the fries and the drink of course and you   can fade that for the price considering you're  just buying two regular sandwiches at regular   price so kudos to mickey d's for the fries and the  drinks with this one i think you need to do that   with the other big gun coming soon here on the  channel but at the same time this is super fun   all right so let's go for one more bite in  this one before we wrap the review up with   the rating coming up next but guys again  my first official mcdonald's hack over here   that i've put together myself and actually  it's part of a national promo pushing this   onto you guys which is pretty fun all right  guys one more bite we'll close it out hang on you know dare i say i'd probably rock this one  again in the not too distant future because the   combination works extremely well so this is a nice  way to kind of baby step people into doing this   type of thing especially if you've never tried  this particular hack on your own it really is a   pretty nice combination and the fish works with  the beef so very solid presentation again i keep   coming back to it because i love the way that  it looks and i got to say guys very hearty even   without the fries i feel pretty good right now  i think i'm pretty much done with this one the   surf plus turf available only on the mcdonald's  app so with that said i'm gonna have to give the   surf plus turf as part of the official menu hacks  here at mickey d's a pretty solid 8.2 and the   reason why i'm giving it a 0.2 over 8 is naturally  because the pricing on this is actually pretty   decent with the fries and the drink on its own a  little expensive but like i said it works better   with these combos that's what mickey d's needs  to be doing with all the other ones on the menu   to kind of push you even further to give it a shot  but on its own guys this actually works pretty   well basically just the bottom half of the filet  of fish the bottom half of the double cheeseburger   then of course it's topped off with the top of  the double cheeseburger so you're basically just   sandwiching that filet fish right there in the  middle a very nice combination and like i said   flavor-wise it works extremely well for what  you've got here guys very tasty to give a go   on and if you're a fan of these two in particular  i think you'll like them together if you've never   tried it this way alright so being that this is  an official hack on the mcdonald's menu here right   now do me a quick favor drop some comments down  below is this truly something that you've done   personally in the past i mean how often do you  do something like this with these two particular   ones in general drop those comments down below and  definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K   closing out another high quality foodie feature  for you here on peep this out reviews bringing   you brand new content every single week here  on my channel so while you stay tuned for that   next review coming real soon in the meantime stay  frosty yes sir who would have thought a filet of   fish in between a double cheeseburger would  taste as good as this does this is actually   a pretty banging combo guys i am absolutely glad  to have checked this one out right now all right   everyone until next time i'll talk to you soon hey  thanks for checking out another one of my reviews   but just in case you didn't see the one before  this one you can find it right up over here along   with what i think youtube's going to recommend  for you to check out as well as always i think   you'll find something to like in both of them and  i'll definitely catch you in the next one see ya
