 hey everyone welcome back to another high quality  foodie feature for you here on the channel   where this time i'm over at jack in the box  to check out what appears to be a nice little   heated upgrade to a newer menu favorite that's  right it's their all new spicy tiny tacos so   stay tuned because they're up next welcome to  peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty all right here we go with the all new spicy tiny  tacos here at jack in the box and already i'm   digging the initial presentation guys that nice  little red tinge on the outside of these little   guys is looking really really cool it definitely  looks to be foreshadowing what i hope is going   to be a nice little heated situation because  on the real these are kind of reminding me of   a flamin hot product they look really really  awesome all right so to break it on down what   i've got here is a 15 piece order of these spicy  tiny tacos and what they consist of as you can see   our mini crispy corn shells kicked up a little  bit of heat and on the inside is that chicken   and spice mixture and guys i got to admit the  mini form makes these things very poppable very   snackable and they do look pretty awesome and  yes i know i've said that a few times already   but guys you can tell me these don't look awesome  all right enough of that for now for dipping we're   going to be going into some creamy avocado lime  sauce this is definitely the way to get these   guys and even though these are advertised with  buttermilk ranch this is definitely the sauce   you want to get this absolutely really really  complements these pretty well and believe me   i know that very well from the last time around  with the regular version so i can't wait to get   into it so guys let's do just that these are the  all new spicy tiny tacos here at jack in the box   let's peep out this flavor my new spicy tiny  tacos a spicy twist on my snackable tiny tacos   yeah man i'm not even gonna front this is  really the perfect box to go with these guys   it's nice and red and i have to have made it  compliments what's on the inside very nicely   this presentation is very killer and again it's  reminding me of something that is flamin hot   i really love the way this corn looks here even  though it's dyed naturally with the coloring it   looks really really good and again on the inside  you've got that little chicken mixture hopefully   that's going to try and focus there but as you  can see a little bit of goodness on the inside   and the nice mini form is definitely pretty solid  on this so let's not waste any more time on these   it's the all new spicy tiny tacos  here at jack in the box let's do it mm-hmm that initial rush of that chicken mixture   oh wow wow there comes the heat wow  this is really hot hang on i'm prepared man that is no joke that is no joke guys this  is really not just like you know dressed up   with a coloring here this is seriously got  some heat to it and it's not the mixture on   the inside it may have a little bit there but  wow this is pretty banging let's keep going in the corn goodness right up front that time anyway   and here comes the heat right after that chicken  mixture that is pretty banging and heated   again let me get you right up on these bad  boys because i'm all about these details and   as you're going to see here again even though  it's colored red guys i have to admit it looks   really really nice and i know i keep saying  that but it's only because it really does   on the inside is that chicken mixture it's got  the familiar taco flavor from their regular stuff   over here but man this thing has really got some  heat and it's a beautiful situation and again the   appearance is banging i know i'm going to get lit  up in the comments down below but guys you can't   tell me this doesn't look very cool very nice  so it's dressed up beautifully it's presented   beautifully there's plenty of them in here for $3.50  that's not a bad deal already let's go for another   one of these before we get into some of that  lime action guys i'm digging it guys i really am   man rich smooth and creamy on that inside  man that heat is crazy this is really good man and it's a hot and crispy day on top  of it that i'm doing this review right now   but man lovely situation again try and focus  that in right over there it's just the right   amount to be snackable on the inside and again  beautifulness on the outside just a banging   version of this i'm so glad this has finally  gone spicy it's really worth it it's nice okay and as i mentioned this is actually  advertised with buttermilk ranch and obviously   to kind of cool it down but this is the jam right  over here creamy avocado lime sauce i think i   actually mentioned i wanted to see this actually  on a burger at some point the fact that this is   permanently on the menu right now i am really  digging the fact that i may have to do something   like that in the future let's get into it with  a little bit of this i mean just the appearance   alone like i said is reminding me of flamin hot  and even like a taki situation because naturally   you think of heat you think of lime you think of  something along those lines right there but man   oh yeah absolutely you can smell that beautifully  already there the avocado goodness it's got that   light greenish tinge there let me grab another one  of these a lovely situation let's go for a dunk   i think that color contrast is a pretty lovely  thing right over there let's go for a little bit   more actually on this there here we go we got  creamy avocado lime sauce let's give it a shot i thought it was just as good the first time  around with the regular version of these   man that is crazy good it is  still kind of cooling it down   which is kind of nice too but man  that heat's beginning to kind of pick up   but it's held back just ever so slightly  with that lime sauce this is really delicious   oh yeah easily this makes this right now for me  instantly really really good so good in fact that   right after that one that heat is now beginning  to kick even further it's really done very well   mmm all right let's go for one more because i think  you get the point with this a lovely situation   very very nice again the texture try and focus  that in hopefully let's just give it a shot again   this sauce makes the difference i'm telling you  it is the jam if you have a jack-in-the-box in   the area you got to do the lime sauce it goes  so beautifully with the heat really really good loving it this is a new favorite now a  jack-in-the-box this is so worth the time   okay one more and then we'll wrap this  one up in just a sec guys delicious stuff   and again it's heated it looks great it's tasty well now that these are permanently on the  menu over here jack in the box i guess it's   no surprise that we're getting a new variation  of these and honestly when it's done this well   this is just a lovely situation indeed guys i  really hope this variant is what stays on the menu   along with the regular because as you can see not  only does it look great it delivers the goodness   all across the board in the heat department and  of course that familiar flavor of the tacos here   at jack-in-the-box just in mini form pair this  up with that lime sauce and guys you have a very   palpable tasty snack any time of the day just a  lovely situation try my new spicy tiny tacos only   at jack-in-the-box so with that said i'm gonna have  to give the all-new spicy tiny tacos here at jack   in the box an easy 9 out of 10 guys the only  way that i can really see to improve upon these   is maybe adding just a little bit more filling to  each one just to round it out just a little bit   maybe even make little mini chimichangas or  something along those lines because the outside   works so well that corn flavor goes amazing  with the heat and the overall spice level   is just perfect enough that no matter what sauce  you get it with in this case definitely that   creamy avocado lime sauce this is really the one  that complements it beautifully i can only imagine   ranch as well but the extra little flavor of lime  overall and just the textural difference that it   gives you while you're eating it together with  the sauce is a beautiful situation in general and   honestly like i said the perfect way to pair it  up guys just delicious stuff all around for real   all right so for all you jackheads out there  have you actually tried this already have you   tried the new heated variant of these tiny tacos  over here at jack in the box drop some comments   down below let me know what you personally  thought of them and honestly which do you   prefer the spicy or the regular and if you've  tried it with that lime sauce how banging is that   drop some comments down below and definitely  let me know and with that this is Ian K   closing out another high
