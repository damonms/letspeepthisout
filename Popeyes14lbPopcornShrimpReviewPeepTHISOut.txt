 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty so it looks like one of the latest promos over at Popeye's is an ala carte item that I've actually never ordered on its own so today looks like the day to finally give it a go and that item as you already know is Popeyes popcorn shrimp and now that I think about it this is probably the first time I'm actually trying these on their own since most of their promos usually feature the butterfly shrimp or just a larger piece of shrimp in general but as you can see we've got a quarter pound of goodness here all for $2.49 this doesn't look too bad at all although obviously they are a little on the small side crispy golden fried goodness as you can see and definitely definitely small more of a snack than anything else and I got to admit they do look pretty tasty instead of going for the usual Creole cocktail sauce I opted for the red hot honey sauce since they're crunch tenders are back featuring that red hot goodness anyway I thought this would be a nice combo to go with this just to kind of see how it's gonna be but looking pretty tasty looking pretty crunchy looking pretty small but hopefully it's gonna be big on flavor guys this is the popcorn shrimp $2.49 special here at Popeyes let's peep out this flavor so if you're a fan of high-quality delicious looking food reviews make sure to hit that subscribe button down below and don't forget to tap that Bell icon so you could be notified as soon as new content drops every week now let's dive into this one yeah they're definitely small but for $2.50 I'm not gonna hate on it guys let's give this a go it's the popcorn shrimp here at Popeye's nice fried goodness kind of a meaty shrimp and that one actually mmm note bad of course that classic Popeyes flavor is coming through that crispy coating is pretty nice with just a little bit of heat surrounding a fairly decent shrimp at least in that first initial bite let's keep going with it we'll give you a close-up on the inside of course since it's popcorn shrimp it's more coating than anything and thankfully it's that familiar Popeyes flavored I think most all of us really enjoy with a slight bit of sizzle but I have to admit the shrimp is really just more of the delivery method to give you that coating here but decent guys pretty decent I guess one of the main selling points with this is the fact that you're getting a quarter pound of popcorn shrimp so on the surface it sounds like you're getting a lot but when you actually see the package obviously it is what it is but I do like the fact that the presentation is decent how bad can fried goodness really be here at Popeyes not bad mmm definitely diggin the light sizzle this coating brings to the party but I only think that's gonna add to the red hot honey sauce that I have ready to go right here in the package and since the hot honey crunch tenders are back on the menu which you guys can take a look at in the upper right hand corner we display right now that was a blast to do about a year ago I think that sauce is gonna do very well with the coating on this so let's go for a dip as you guys can see before I give this one a dip here we've got a nice little cup of red hot honey goodness guys and as you can see it's got lots of red flakes all throughout and it definitely smells very sweet let's give this a go it's fairly thick as I can feel it here this is looking pretty good but does it taste good let's confirm it tastes good well let me start this portion of the review off by saying this red-hot honey sauce is just as tasty as I remember it from about a year ago nice amount of heat that it's delivering here on top of the sweetness and you can really taste the honey guys it goes amazingly well with the coating of the shrimp itself and even with the chicken I think you know what you're in for some pretty tasty stuff I mean of course it goes amazingly well with the fried coating here at Popeyes and the fact that the nooks and crannies actually soak it up very nicely guys it's just a very tasty thing and for $2.49 for this snack I would recommend getting the sauce on the side on top of the Creole this is actually really good mmm so just a quick closing close-up shot of what to expect you guys obviously popcorn shrimp is what it is they're very very tiny and it's the coating that's gonna sell this one for you so if you're a fan of Popeyes in general which I think most of you are if you've gotten this far into the review you have a lot to look forward to and for $2.49 not a bad deal for a quarter pound of this goodness well I'm glad I can finally scratch this one off the bucket list here at Popeyes pretty tasty like I was expecting it to be because it is Popeyes famous coating but again the shrimp I only wish they were just a little bit bigger but for $2.49 like I said for a quarter pound of popcorn shrimp not a bad deal for a snack so with that said I'm gonna have to give the $2.49 quarter pound special of popcorn shrimp over here at Popeyes a pretty decent 8 out of 10 but like I said please get it with the red hot honey sauce you're gonna thank me for it but the question is are you gonna give us a go so you can hopefully thank me for it or are you a fan of this already drop those comments down below let me know what you thought of the popcorn shrimp over here at Popeyes is it one of
