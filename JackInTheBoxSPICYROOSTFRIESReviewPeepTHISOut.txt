 hey everyone welcome back to another high quality  foodie feature for you here on the channel where   this time i'm over at jack-in-the-box to see if  their latest promo can rule the roost for summer   just as the season's beginning to heat up so  without further ado here we go with their all-new   spicy roost fries and in keeping with the heated  theme of the season guys it looks like we've   got some sliced jalapeno action to go in on so  breaking this one down from bottom to top it looks   like we've got a portion of their hot and salty  fries topped with 100% white meat chicken pieces   cheddar cheese sauce shredded cheddar cheese  sliced jalapenos and a spicy mystery sauce for   added kick and guys i gotta say the combination  is looking pretty nice lots of fried goodness here   and it definitely smells pretty fantastic all  right so let's not waste any more time on this   one it's the all new spicy roost fries here  at jack in the box let's peep out this flavor   you know one of the things that i definitely dig  whenever i review jack in the box is the marketing   for their food and this one is no exception guys  rule the roost i'm really digging the way these   roost fries are coming packaged right now hot  and crispy i like it saucy chow down very cool   but guys it's all about what's on the inside that  counts and again it presents very nicely here   plenty of cheddar cheese sauce sliced jalapeno  action it looks like maybe a long chicken strip   that's sliced up there on top and guys the smell  is pretty awesome this really does smell kind of   heated and believe it or not i'm kind of getting  wafts of like that secret sauce i'm thinking it's   from the cluck sandwich i did not that long ago  you guys can take a look at that popping up on   your screen here right now i'm almost willing  to bet that's going to be the same type of sauce   but you know what let me just get into it here  and we'll confirm it for you i'm going to grab   a jalapeno we'll grab a chicken piece there  take a look very lovely situation guys let's   give this a shot it's the spicy variant of the  roost fries here at jack-in-the-box let's do it mmm oh oh heat yeah that spicy mystery sauce along  with those jalapenos are delivering a nice amount   of heat and again just like i thought it feels  like a variation of that cluck sandwich sauce from   a few months back but guys i am really digging the  quality so far of the chicken that's what i kind   of got in that last bite as well really like  the fact that these are kind of chunky pieces   which is nice but they go amazing with the cheese  sauce and man my mouth is watering like crazy   right now it's gonna be a little bit difficult to  get to this review but let's just keep going in the chicken tenders are bomb over here i gotta  say i'm kind of wishing i did this one at night   as a cheater's cam review because the heat in my  car is not doing me any favors on top of the heat   that this is delivering as well and like i said  it's the combination of that spicy mystery sauce   and those jalapenos that are doing it it really  warrants the name on spicy roost fries for this   and again guys going very nicely with the chicken  the cheese sauce of course and naturally those hot   and crispy fries definitely a bomb situation here  yeah these jalapenos are absolutely heated right   now and they've got some nice seeds to go with  guys that's where a lot of that heat is coming   from but i love the pickled flavor that they've  got going as well and of course when you combine   that with the cheese sauce on this try and lift  this up here very very nice indeed guys let me   give you some more of these glory shots of  the goodness as you can see lots of cheesy   goodness they are not skimping on the amount  of cheese on this right now let's keep going in oh man steamy action right now really good and  because i don't want that flavor to go away so   fast let's go for a piece of that chicken one more  time again nice and crispy on this that white meat   action is very nicely done nice and chunky again  it feels more like just a standard chicken strip   that they chopped up but i'm not complaining  because the quality is good let's keep going in good stuff yeah i had a feeling i was gonna like  this i mean how could you not crispy fries with   a cheddar cheese sauce you're already winning  in that department and then when you add the   crispy chicken on top of it which is fairly  juicy nice and crispy to go with everything   else that is crispy anyway on top of the  spicy goodness guys a nice combination and   of course the jalapeno is a nice little accent  which you'd kind of expect to find in anything   quote-unquote spicy but this really is spicy  because like i said the combination is working   so yeah i'm super glad to have checked this  one out right now and again i kind of wish   i just did this at night because honestly  i'm really feeling a lot more heated than   i should be even with my little fan going on  the side of me here right now let's go for a   little bit more on this one guys and we'll wrap  this one up but a lovely situation and again   take a look at that action right there guys  just a nice combination of goodness you're   getting everything all in one bite here and i  gotta admit nice combination of jalapeno sauce   fries all that good stuff let's knock this  one off and then we'll wrap this review up well for the $3.50 price point here in southern cali  for this one i gotta say i'm pretty satisfied with   the quality of this overall it's got some heft  it's got some weight and of course the crispiness   and the heat to go with just a fun combination  of ingredients together and guys the packaging   again is really just the icing on the cake to get  into this one just a lovely combination all around   order on ubereats postmates and grubhub so with  that said i'm going to have to give the all-new   spicy roost fries here at jack in the box a pretty  rock solid 8.5 out of 10 this really   did satisfy the itch for something crunchy  something heated something a little cheesy   for sure and when it's on top of the fries that  they have over here which are salty to begin with   guys just a nice combination i thought it kind of  accentuated the flavor just a bit kind of like a   salty type of cheese which i really dig anyway and  let's not forget about what i think is the wild   card with this one that's spicy mystery sauce it  really does feel like a variation of the mystery   sauce from their cluck sandwiches a few months  back and honestly guys it adds so much to what's   already here because it's elevated in some heat to  begin with so combination of the heat combination   of the salty the cheesy you've got a pretty nice  combination of goodness here all right so i've got   one simple question for you if you've got jack in  the box in the area which variation of these roost   fries are you gonna go with the spicy one that  i just did right now or the one without the heat   drop some comments down below and definitely  let me know and with that this is Ian K   closing out another
