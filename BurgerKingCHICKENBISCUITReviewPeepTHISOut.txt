 hey everyone i'm back at it this time here at bk early in the morning because it looks like they've actually got chicken biscuits on the menu yeah this is actually news to me too so stay tuned because it's up next welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty well i'm going in blind on this one it's the chicken biscuit here at bk and as the name implies it is definitely that it is basically just a biscuit with a piece of chicken in the middle of it here nothing special but i gotta admit it smells pretty special lots of hints of butter in the air here right now and you can definitely tell this biscuit was made fresh it's very hot nothing on the inside of this one except a very small piece of chicken interesting shape on that one there it's breaded up fried to a crispy golden brown a little bit of cracked pepper it looks like as well underneath it just the bottom of the biscuit but pretty cool guys and size wise it's not too bad i mean a little on the small side for what it is but it's exactly what it says it is it's a chicken biscuit we're going to go for a little bit of syrup on this one at the very end just to kind of see how that's going to be they recommended going with that but it looks pretty tasty it smells pretty decent as well for $2.29 not too bad let's give this one a shot and see how the flavor is it's the chicken biscuit here at bk let's peep out this flavor yeah definitely some nice hints of butter in the air right now guys i'm getting that feeling on my fingers right now as well so i'm thinking this is going to be pretty good and since i'm actually going into this blind i'm really hoping this is a buttermilk biscuit on top of it there most of them at fast food restaurants usually are but let's give this a shot and see how this one is but before i take that first bite and like always if you guys are fans of high quality delicious looking food reviews make sure to hit that subscribe button down below and don't forget to tap the bell icon so you can be notified as soon as brand new content drops every week here we go the mysterious chicken biscuit at least for me anyway here at bk that's buttermilk hmm okay well it's a little dry believe it or not but the chicken flavor is coming through very nicely so yes it is a little bit on the dense side in terms of the biscuit but the overall flavor of the chicken goes pretty nicely with it it's kind of a hearty type of bite but i gotta say guys not bad on the biscuit itself again a little on the dry side but hey the seasoning on the chicken is actually pretty good and considering this is a little bit bigger than maybe three or four nuggets put together and kind of flattened out it actually has a very cool shape to it and i like the overall taste of it which is really good so let me go for one more bite we'll give you another close-up and then we'll get into a little bit of syrup hang on that last bite was actually a little bit better overall and as i'm beginning to get further into this one it's got a nice creaminess to it the batter that they're actually using for this biscuit is pretty good and while it's a little on the drier side i would have liked this a little bit more moisture the overall flavor of the chicken is really making this one stand out so not bad for what this is but as you can see a simple build on this one little piece of chicken some carb to go around it and essentially a pretty decent amount of flavor not too bad so as i was ordering this one inside i was led down the path to get some syrup to go with this so i think that's going to be a pretty decent combination anyway let's get into it right now and see if it is let's go for this section right here on the side and i think that's going to be a pretty good bite a little bit of everything it's just chicken and a biscuit so i've got it all the aroma of that maple is already setting this one off let's hit it that is the ticket right there yup that sweet maple adds just the right amount of moisture to really kind of liven things up just a bit so the nice butteriness feel that i'm getting from the biscuit itself is only enhanced by that and naturally with the flavor of that chicken in there as well that's pretty good let me go for just a little bit more on this that's actually really nice just a little bit it's a little on the sweet side as you'd expect it to be the syrup is pretty sweet hmm yeah it's a nice combo i'm almost getting the vibe like pancakes and syrup because of the biscuit and i like that it's pretty cool for breakfast all right let me give you one last close-up shot of the cross section on this one and then we'll finish out the review after the rating but let me just say that syrup completely makes this biscuit come alive and i'm so glad i was led down the path to try it with that it really rounds out the overall flavor very solid so let's do a little 360 action here naturally anything fried is gonna be pretty decent guys and this chicken is not too bad it's going to remind you of the chicken nuggets here at bk for obvious reasons because that's what it feels like it's like maybe three or four of them put together then flattened and then on this freshly made biscuit very solid and although the biscuit is just okay on its own it really comes alive like i said with that maple syrup definitely get it with that it's worth your time so with that said i'm gonna have to give the chicken biscuit here at bk a pretty decent 7 out of 10 i mean it's okay for what it is the value is not too bad either at $2.29 it's about average but the overall flavor is really enhanced with that maple syrup so like i said it's got that buttery feel the quality of the biscuit is decent i'm definitely getting a buttermilk vibe with that one and the chicken is seasoned pretty well with a little bit of that pepper thrown in there but again it's like a big chicken nugget with a little bit of carb around it though but guys like i said that maple syrup is crazy it really is good with that okay now the obvious question because like i said this is new for me right now do you guys have chicken biscuits available at your bk in your area because it's not available here in the app and it's not on the main menu on the website it's only locally available as like a little sign stand in the grass outside the restaurant here drop some comments down below let me know if you've got this one available and what do you think of it and with that this is Ian K closing out another episode of peep this out bringing you brand new
