 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty all right everyone let's get it it's Ian K back  again with another high quality foodie feature for   you here on peep this out reviews this time over  at church's chicken because it looks like they're   finally throwing their hat into the ring when it  comes to the famed fast food chicken sandwich wars   with a couple of pretty awesome looking contenders  so let's go in on one of them feast your eyes   on church's classic chicken sandwich coming in  some pretty familiar foil packaging guys that's   actually looking pretty nice but sitting on top of  it is obviously the star of the show a very nice   situation with that star cut bun on the very top  they're nice and soft let's take a look underneath   and see what we've got looks like about four thick  cut pickles along with some mayo and some of their   signature honey butter that's actually toasted  into the bun as you guys can see there but take   a look at the chicken itself a pretty decent sized  piece of white meat that's hand breaded in store   and then fried up to a crispy golden brown not too  bad in the size department there looking pretty   nice and underneath it it looks like we've got  a little bit more of that honey butter toasted   into the bun along with a little bit more of that  mayo but guys feast your eyes on what comes with   this here you actually get a whole jalapeno  even though this is not the spicy variant   you get a little heat to go with it so pretty  cool but overall i'm thinking this is going to   be pretty tasty guys the ingredients list is  minimal but it looks awesome so let's go in   on the flavor to see if this one's gonna deliver  it's the all new classic chicken sandwich here at   church's chicken let's peep out this flavor well  as you guys saw in that clip in the very beginning   church's chicken is finally jumping into the famed  fast food chicken sandwich wars and guys you know   what better late than never because honestly you'd  expect something from churchs already and the   fact that we're waiting about a year and a half  after the other guys to really come out with some   serious competition guys let me just say this is  some competition look at that chicken patty right   there that is a lovely situation the pickles  also and i'm really digging this star-cut bun   on the very top very excited to bite into this  one here right now and i love the fact that it   comes in that foil packaging also you know who  they're targeting with that right okay so before   i bite into this one and hopefully confirm the  awesomeness if you guys are fans of high quality   delicious looking food reviews make sure you hit  that subscribe button down below and don't forget   to tap that bell icon so you can be notified  as soon as brand new content drops every week   guys one more time you can never get enough  good looks of this one here this is really   really awesome looking i'm really digging the  breading it's very authentic and very churchs   if that means something to you and i'll explain  a little bit further in as we go let's give this   one a shot it's the all-new classic chicken  sandwich here at church's chicken let's do it already right as i went into this one that  instant church's flavor was coming through   loud and clear but a thick version of it and  guys let me just show this to you right away   as you guys can see the white meat is pretty  plentiful in this one here and i am digging the   fact that the coating doesn't really overpower the  white meat at all i'd probably say it's maybe   70% meat and 30% coating but guys it's a beautiful ratio and then the snap of the pickles in there as   well with a light honey butter that i'm tasting in  there as well on top of that the mayo is a little   non-existent because it's really kind of blended  in with everything else but man the saltiness   is perfect with this on top of the honey butter  let's go for another bite this is pretty banging crunchy too so that signature church's flavor that  i was talking about earlier is absolutely coming   through here it's not nearly as salty as the other  guys and definitely distinct to the chain here and   i have to admit with the honey butter added to  it it adds the right amount of butteriness on   top of it and then you get the nice juiciness of  the white meat along with the acidity the snap   and the crunch of those pickles it's just a nice  tartness on top of it but man super flavorful   guys and again the softness of that star cut  bun on the very top is a very nice touch but   the main stars of the show is a lovely situation  right here in the middle this is really delicious   yeah guys no joke this is serious competition  like i said and if it's going to come from   any type of chain out there outside of the  other guys you know who i'm talking about   it's actually going to need to be coming from a  chicken spot that i think people know and love   and especially here on the west coast and  some places around the country churchs is   pretty well known so the fact that they finally  have a variation of a chicken sandwich on their   menu which i don't think they've ever had that  really says a lot because they absolutely seem   to have taken their time to put this one out here  but i'm so glad and i got to tell you that they   actually have the honey butter mixed in with this  here because it adds so much just a little bit of   light sweetness but the overall butteriness that  it adds on top of the juiciness of the chicken   is just off the chain and again i love the fact  that the chicken is not overly fried i mean it's   fried but not overly breaded and very heavy  in terms of that so let me give you another   shot of this before i take that bite but this is  really really an awesome situation if you guys   have a churchs in the area of course you're  gonna be giving this one a shot because it's   lit up all over the restaurant right now plenty  of banners plenty of like hoopla to kind of let   you know we've got a chicken sandwich finally  this is pretty awesome let's go for it again man i'm so excited about this chicken sandwich  right now and granted i know it's just a chicken   sandwich but guys considering how long we've  been hearing about the other guys with their   chicken sandwich for so long it's nice to  have some serious competition and literally   it's coming from a chain that you'd expect it to  like i said earlier this is really really awesome   the place that specializes in chicken you already  know it's going to be a pretty banging situation   because of what they're known for anyway so  one more bite we'll finish this one up after   the rating but guys i think you know where i'm  going with this one this is easily an all day   long situation especially at $3.99 and it's just  beautiful all around let's go for one last bite   you know it's pretty amazing what the honey  butter does to the overall recipe with this   chicken sandwich guys and considering the size of  it which is pretty decent i have to admit it works   extremely well along with those pickles in there  for added snap acidity and crunch which i love   saying they really do add all of those things to  this here the presentation of it really delivers   and overall it's a very tasty fast food chicken  sandwich guys and for $3.99 like i said how could   you go wrong it's great to have choice and this  is a solid one churchs bringing that down home   flavor so let's just jump right on over to the  rating because i think you know what's coming   right i'm gonna have to give the classic chicken  sandwich over here at church's chicken the obvious   10 out of 10 guys this really does deliver across  the board because like i said it's the authentic   church's chicken flavor that you know and love  from them if you're familiar with them already   with a little bit more of a heightened type  of flavor thanks to the honey butter being   toasted into the bun and the overall recipe and  thickness of everything that it adds on top of   the crunch and snap and acidity of the pickles not  necessarily in that order but you know where i'm   going with it it really works extremely well and  the fact that it's on a nice soft start cut bun   there guys i mean it's a nice delivery system  naturally you want to have something that's   almost like a catcher's mitt to deliver it into  your face and everything works extremely well so   there's really nothing else i can really say about  this one except for the fact that i'm definitely   gonna be back to try the spicy version you guys  have that to look forward to very soon absolutely   alright so now the obvious question if you've  got a church's chicken in the area are you gonna   be giving this one a shot and actually if you even  don't have a church's chicken in the area are you   gonna be traveling to give this one a shot are you  excited to give this a go to see how it compares   to the other guys drop some comments down below  and definitely let me know and with that this is   Ian K closing out
