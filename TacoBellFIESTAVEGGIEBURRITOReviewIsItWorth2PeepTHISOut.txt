 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty what's going on everyone and welcome back  to another high quality foodie feature for   you here on the channel where i've returned to  taco bell yet again to complete the trifecta of   their all new two dollar burritos now available on  their cravings value menu for a limited time only   now of course it begs the question did i save the  best for last well we're about to find out guys   feast your eyes on their all-new fiesta veggie  burrito and i gotta say guys i'm definitely down   with the amount of rice in this already along  with those black beans which are looking really   really tasty all right so going down the laundry  list for this one we've got a standard warm flour   tortilla filled with black beans seasoned  rice chipotle sauce reduced fat sour cream   tomatoes guacamole a three cheese blend and fiesta  strips for added color and possibly crunch as well   and on the real considering the amount of  ingredients in this one i was expecting this   one to feel a little packed in my hands and it  absolutely does guys so without further ado let's   see if this one's gonna deliver on taste because  it's got a lot of goodies on the inside of it   here we go with the all new fiesta veggie  burrito here at taco bell let's do it flavor we're right off the break that slight sizzle  that i'm getting from the chipotle sauce is   mixing beautifully with the reduced fat sour cream  guys that's a beautiful flavor indeed on this one   combine that in with the heartiness of the  black beans on top of it and you definitely   have a very nice flavor profile so far i haven't  gotten into the guacamole just yet as you can see   but there is plenty of all the other goodness  on the inside of this one i am totally digging   what i'm having here right now and for two  bucks so far this is looking pretty worth it   yeah and even with the tomatoes on the  inside of this one i'm not minding it   so much let's go for another couple more bites  on this one guys this is actually pretty tasty well so far no guacamole but all the other  flavors are definitely singing with this one   with the dominant flavors being that reduced  fat sour cream in the chipotle sauce guys it   definitely has really awesome flavor and when you  combine that with the mouth feel of the rice and   of course the black beans the hardiness overall  so far this is really really tasty i'm definitely   digging this variant of these two dollar burritos  here but still no guacamole just yet but even   still like i said the flavor profile is absolutely  up there and if you guys are still curious about   the other two that are available on the menu take  a look at those reviews popping up on your screen   here right now the beefy melt was definitely a  tasty situation but i gotta say that chipotle   ranch grilled chicken burrito definitely elevated  their game nicely and considering the two dollar   price point i'm not minding that whatsoever guys  because you're getting a lot of packed goodness on   the inside of these so very tasty but at the same  time no guacamole so far at least on this half   and as i'm getting further into this right now  what i'm also beginning to find is it's not as   toasted as i would have liked as well i mean that  chipotle ranch grilled chicken burrito that just   it had some really nice grilled marks in the top and  bottom this one not so much i mean it's definitely   toasted and you guys can kind of see a little  bit of that on the outside but there's nothing   distinct to say that this was pressed any longer  than maybe a couple of seconds really just to kind   of seal that tortilla right there but still tasty  for what it is and for two bucks i'm not hating on   it all right so let's go for one more bite in  this one before the rating comes up next here   guys but i gotta say i'm really digging the fact  that taco bell really embraces the veggie menu   that they have on here and considering black  beans is leading the charge along with all the   other stuff on their menu it's a lovely situation  one more bite and we'll close this one out hang on well here's a shot of the other half just to round  this one out guys and it looks like there is no   guacamole to speak of even though it's supposed  to be one of the ingredients on the inside of   here and one of the main ones i think that would  go really beautifully with the sour cream as   well as a chipotle sauce but it's not here but  what is here is definitely filling this one out   nicely and again i just wish it was a little bit  more toasty on the top and bottom but at the same   time it's great to have choices and this veggie  option definitely is a solid one not bad at all   order ahead and pick yours up at our contactless  drive-through so with that said i'm gonna have   to give the fiesta veggie variant of these two  dollar burritos here at taco bell as part of   the cravings value menu just an okay 6.5 out of 10 guys like i said the guacamole   is definitely missing from this and that would  have added so much overall to the flavor that   i've already been enjoying with this one now keep  in mind it's still very delicious but at the same   time i really wish i would have had that guac in  there at least just for the color differentiation   between everything else in there because the  red strips as well a little on the soggy side   you kind of expect that but at the same time the  flavor profile that i did experience right now   was pretty solid and for two bucks like i said  you can't really hate on it okay so now that i've   completed the trifecta of the two dollar burritos  over here as part of the cravings value menu to   talk about which is your particular favorite drop  some comments down below let me know if you've   given all three a shot and actually which is your  all-time favorite out of these three that you'd   hope they'd keep on the menu longer
