 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty just in time for baseball season BK swings for the fences with single double and triple versions of their all new stacker King so let's go into the version you know you absolutely want to check out the triple stacker King featuring three-quarters of a pound of beef three slices of American cheese a ridiculous amount of bacon and a lot of stacker sauce guys this thing is an absolute monster here right now let me pop the top on the sesame seed bun so you guys can see what I'm talking about an absolutely insane amount of hickory smoked bacon and stacker sauce and guys where to begin with this one here I pretty much broke it down for ya let me see if we can try and split this just a little bit delicious cheese pull in the middle there we've got those two patties right there separated let's go down again this is absolutely insane it smells amazing it's classic BK aroma in the car here right now and as you can see a loaded burger so no stacker sauce on the bottom because there's plenty on top but this is absolutely insane there's literally bacon falling out of this here right now and just so much sauce so much beef so much cheese looking really really ridiculous I know this is gonna be fantastic already guys let's get into it and check out that flavor it's the triple stacker King brand new here at BK let's peep out this flavor oh my god this absolutely looks insane definitely the biggest burger I've ever featured here on my channel let alone the biggest burger I've ever tried from BK let's dive in it's the stacker king triple here at BK and this is definitely a two-hander here we go oh man diving into that one was an experience on that first bite 3/4 pound patties in effect here guys I can barely get my mouth wrapped around this one it is crazy delicious it's all the classic BK flavors with a lot more of it at one time so very hard to take that first bite as you can see with the triple plenty of bacon plenty of the stacker sauce the stacker sauce is very reminiscent of like Big Mac sauce it's very close to that to me but I have to say guys the flame grilled patties from BK stand out far above and beyond anything else in terms of the flavor it's distinctly BK and I have to tell you insane let's keep going and we're definitely a go for that close up you're gonna want to see the inside of this one big time here we go again mmm so much bacon this truly is a king in triple form guys have a look at that that is a ridiculous amount of beef you are checking out right in front of you right now three slices of that American cheese and 3/4 of a pound of 100% flame-grilled beef insane the hickory smoked bacon is off the chart a nice fluffy bun to go with and plenty of that stacker sauce guys if you like BK or hamburgers in general you need to try this version at least once it's absolutely insane I can't speak more highly about it and let me also say after only two bites I'm already getting kind of full guys and not just from the beef and the cheese because there's plenty of that on here let me bring you up one more time take a look at the very top of that bun guys it's loaded with stacker sauce and just as much bacon practically as beef it feels like this is just an insane amount of goodness here from BK a little extreme I know it's gluttonous but I have to admit guys try this at least once because it's just damn delicious and there's really no other way to put it because it really is that stacker sauce has a nice little tang to it as well coming up on the back end after all of the flavors from the beef and the cheese and it's just enough I got to admit just to let you know that it's there even though it's kind of lathered on the very top of this right now there's so much meat and cheese on this on top of the hickory-smoked of the bacon that you really can't help but taste those dominant flavors first and then the stacker sauce comes in but man it is just absolutely insane and the bacon nice and crispy although that one looks a little floppy right over there but it is definitely on the crispier side mmm let's go for one more close-up because I have to keep this one front and center for you guys if you're not salivating by now there's absolutely something wrong with you and if you're watching this after midnight please accept my humble apologies you need to be jumping over to BK immediately to grab one of these easily a recommendation for all the major flavors from BK in between two pieces of bread and lots of it the triple stacker King is definitely bomb alright first off let me just say this new Kings reign is going to be absolutely memorable here at BK in my opinion it's easily up there the farmhouse King my all-time favorite King burger here at BK and while that one definitely had a lot more going on under the hood what this new version delivers is absolutely off the chain in terms of flavor guys I mean you can't go wrong with 3/4 of a pound of beef three slices of cheese a ton of hickory smoked bacon and a lot of that stacker sauce it's very gluttonous it's very delicious and it's definitely something you've got to treat yourself with at least once because it is so delicious diving into all that beefy goodness guys beefy cheesy bacony goodness how bad could that possibly be and not only did it absolutely look and smell delicious the flavor was absolutely insane on it as you'd expect it to be guys it was just an incredible burger so as if you don't know already I'm gonna have to give the triple stacker King here at BK a rock-solid 10 out of 10 there is absolutely no way this burger could have failed in my eyes guys considering everything that it had and the fact that it was ultra juicy on top of it absolutely set my taste buds into the stratosphere like I said try this one at least once you are gonna thank me for it I guarantee it flame grilled beef patties melted American cheese crispy bacon and savory stacker sauce but of course the question is are you gonna drop some comments down below let me know if you're gonna give this all-new stacker King a shot whether it's the single to double or the triple and just between you and me did this one kind of scare you off just a little bit considering how much beef it had drop those comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K closing out another episode of peep this out bringing you brand new content every single week here on my channel so while you stay tuned for that next review coming real soon in the meantime stay frosty there's definitely a new king in town and it's a monster alright everyone until next time I'll talk to you soon
