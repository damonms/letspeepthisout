 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty all right everyone welcome back to another high  quality foodie feature for you here on the channel   cheaters cam style after hours once again over  at jack-in-the-box to go in at a new version of   their all-new sauced and loaded fries because it  looks like they're going pint-sized this time out   well sorta so let's go in on what they're  calling sauced and loaded tots and as you   can see this box seems to be packed almost  to the top there guys looking pretty nice   what we've got here obviously is a very nice  portion of tater tots topped off with you   guessed it a cheese sauce sliced jalapenos  and ranch sauce this is looking pretty good   guys and i have to admit doing this late at  night you just know i'm down for that ooey   gooey cheesy ranchy goodness with a little  bit of heat thrown into the mix thanks to   those sliced jalapenos i'm thinking so let's  not waste any more time on this one these are   the jalapeno ranch sauced and loaded tots here  at jack-in-the-box let's peep out this flavor   yeah i'm not gonna lie this is definitely looking  like some pretty decadent fast food goodness after   hours here at jack in the box and admittedly  it's something they do very very well in fact   they really promote their late night goodness  here very nicely on the box as you can see and   i think jack here on the very back of it is very  excited i'm going to be getting into this but guys   feast your eyes on that looking pretty nice  on the inside lots of ooey gooey goodness and   again the fried aroma that i'm getting from the  tater tots is pretty amazing so let's get into   this right now i'm going to grab a little bit  of everything here we've got the cheese sauce   the ranch a little bit of that jalapeno action as  well really digging this right now as i'm losing   the jalapeno hang on one second i wish there was a  little bit more of them there's not too many let's   get into it here we go guys the sauced and loaded  tots jalapeno ranch over here at jack let's do it not bad at all come on you knew  it wasn't going to be right wow   the nice steamy heat that i'm getting from  those sliced jalapenos hang on one second very very nice on that guys they really are pretty  nice and the tots themselves let me lift one of   these up here they're kind of falling apart just  a little bit because there's a lot of cheese on   it but let me show you one of these here take a  look at that it's pretty much an average sized   tot nothing too crazy just a little crispy on  the outside a little bit soggy on the inside   and it's actually holding its composure  with all the stuff on it there even though   they're kind of falling apart as i was  getting into that first bite you can   really taste the crispiness pretty  nicely of it let's keep going in man fried potato goodness after hours come on  this is pretty nice let's go for a little bit more   and that ranch kind of cooling it off  nothing too crazy really really nice   the ranch sauce over here at jack is pretty  awesome and again very nice situation i've   actually got that jalapeno hanging out in the  back right over there let's go for it again man this is crazy delicious right now and i gotta  say at least with this variant anyway it's almost   as good as the curly fry version and honestly  guys i've done a few of those reviews in the   past of the loaded and sauced curly fries take  a look at the reviews playlist popping up on   your screen here right now you'll find them in the  jack playlist there but the difference with this   obviously is it doesn't really have a lot to kind  of soak up into the nooks and crannies of those   loaded fries i mean the curly fries actually were  able to hold a lot of the toppings pretty well   this is pretty much all front loaded so naturally  here as you're eating it it's all mixing together   and it feels thicker but honestly i think i  kind of prefer the loaded fry version personally   because those curly fries like i said got into the  nooks and crannies and those spiral type of fries   really soaked them all in but guys  this is a nice alternative and again   it's tater tots and there's a decent amount  of them on the inside let's keep going yeah this is pretty tasty and it's been a minute  since i've had tater tots i got to be honest with   you guys it's not something that i have pretty  often but this is pretty good and considering the   other options on the menu the only other one i saw  besides the jalapeno ranch variant was a cheese   and bacon but they've actually got a chili cheese  option on the box here and i'm pretty sure that's   like a no-brainer to have that available on the  menu anyway considering chili cheese has been used   in the past here more recently actually on the  chili cheeseburger which again take a look at the   jack-in-the-box playlist in the upper right-hand  corner of your display for my in-depth look at   their double chili cheeseburger which obviously  they're going to be using the chili from that   in this because like i said it's just a different  type of fried potato with a multitude of toppings   they can do with this so aside from the jalapeno  variant you've got the cheese and bacon to look   forward to and obviously chili cheese at one point  very very tasty in this and again ranch is like   one of my all-time favorites having that with some  gooey cheese which i gotta admit almost feels like   a cheddar situation a very lovely one at that  as well but as you can see guys crispy tasty   goodness and you really can't fade the fact late  night goodness here at jack-in-the-box this is   definitely a nice addition why they waited so long  to do the tot variant i don't know but i'm really   digging the fact that we've got one available now  a little bit of heat a little bit of coolness a   little bit of both delicious stuff really really  good so let me give you another shot of this one   as we round this review out and as you can see a  lot of the tots are beginning to fall apart here   because of all the cheesy ranchy goodness on the  inside here they start off very crispy but then   they easily begin to kind of lose their composure  just a little bit here as i'm getting further in   but guys as mushy as it looks it's ultra flavorful  and that's really where it counts and this really   is a very fun thing to check out especially late  night here at jack not bad whatsoever on this   order on ubereats postmates and grubhub all  right so let me start off this wrap up by   saying if you decide to get this one make sure  you get right to it because as you get further   into it it's going to all congeal together so if  you really want to enjoy the crispiness right away   don't wait too long after you order this one make  sure you're actually enjoying it immediately after   the drive through if you get this delivered to  you get to it ASAP but as it stands the flavor   is crazy good on it guys the ranch sauce is one of  my favorites here at jack-in-the-box add in a nice   creamy cheese sauce with just the right amount of  saltiness and some sliced jalapenos come on this   is a beautiful situation but obviously you already  know because i said it earlier in the review i'm   a much bigger fan of the loaded curly fry version  of it they're literally the curly fries themselves   because like i also mentioned it really kind  of holds all those toppings pretty nicely there   and they kind of stay a little bit crispier for  some reason i don't know what it is but with tots   i just wish they kept the crispiness just a  little bit as we went there but still guys   super delicious so with that said i'm going to  have to give the jalapeno ranch variant of the   sauced and loaded tots brand new here at jack  in the box a rock solid 8 out of 10 like i   said the flavor delivers on these because guys how  could it not it's a creamy cheese sauce and ranch   with sliced jalapenos you can put that on pretty  much anything and it's going to enhance the flavor   the good thing though is the quality of the tots  are decent i only wish like i said throughout this   review they stayed just a little bit crispier  as i went there and they just pretty much   stayed together in general everything got mushy  towards the end but still guys delicious stuff   delicious stuff all around all right i've got  two simple questions for you first and foremost   do you actually like ranch on fries i mean i'm  willing to bet if you've made it this far into   the review you probably do but if you do like  ranch on fries what are some of your favorite   types of fries to have it on tots shoestring  fries curly fries what type of fries are your   favorite and lastly and of course the obvious if  you've got jack in the box in the area how excited   are you to give this a shot and if you do give it  a shot here's the bonus question for number three   are you gonna be doing it late at night like  i am right now it's super fun if you do just   so you know drop those comments down below and  definitely let me know and with that this is   Ian K closing out another high quality foodie  feature for you here on peep this out reviews   cheaters cam style after hours bringing you
