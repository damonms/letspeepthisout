 hey everyone welcome back to another high  quality foodie feature for you here on the   channel where this time i'm over a good old bk  because it looks like a newer menu favorite is   slimming down as part of a new promo that's  right it's the single quarter pound king so   stay tuned because it's up next welcome to  peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty so here we go with the single quarter pound king  here at bk and already we're being greeted by that   very familiar whopper size sesame seed bun guys  it's pretty unmistakable and it looks like we've   got a lot of tasty goodness we're about to get  into right there in the middle so let's pop the   top and take a look underneath and it looks like  we've got a decent amount of ketchup and mustard   along with some onions it looks like we've  also got a bunch of dill pickles along with   two slices of american cheese and that's all on  top of a quarter pound flame grilled beef patty   seasoned up with a little salt and pepper as well  and guys again definitely some tasty goodness on   this one and you can really smell those pickles  too underneath it looks like there's nothing there   but guys obviously we've got everything front  loaded on the very top of this one here and it's   looking pretty dynamite so let's not waste any  more time on this one let's get into it this is   the single quarter pound king here at bk let's  peep out this flavor yes sir some flame grilled   goodness right here guys with plenty of pickle  aroma going with it along with a mustard this is   really standing out pretty nicely and like i said  you can tell this is a pretty wide burger it's got   the whopper bun and it is really spread out that  meat is looking pretty nice right there along with   the onions the ketchup the mustard definitely a  banging situation and considering it's a single   and not a double i don't think i'm gonna miss too  much of the meat on this one because still there's   a decent amount of meat spread out over here guys  one more time tasty goodness all around let's not   waste any more time again here we go it's the  single quarter pound king here at bk let's do it already sorry i'm talking with my mouth full  but you already know what it is guys that familiar   flame grilled taste is coming through right away and  plenty of pickle goodness along with the crunch of   the onions on this one and the melted cheese this  is definitely a very very solid burger right now   it's really giving me that vibe of that backyard  barbecue type of taste it's really distinct for   bk the flavor is unmistakable and i gotta say  again guys the combination of all the toppings   on this one the ketchup the mustard the onions  and the pickles it's basic but it gets the job   done along with the meltiness of the cheese two  slices is perfect because it's creamy enough you   can taste it and obviously i'm digging it already  let's go in again on this one it's pretty tasty now let's just say i do love me a nice quarter  pounder with cheese from the other guys but i   gotta say when it comes to bk's version of it they  do it very very nicely the flavor is so distinct   to the brand with all the same toppings as the  other guys but even still what you're getting here   is a lot of fresh goodness and like i said it  combos very nicely with each other along with   the softness of the bun just overall a very tasty  cheeseburger and you know what as tasty as this is   on its own for $6.29 it's actually gonna be part  of the 2 for $6 they've got right now so that   single bacon king that i reviewed that's part of  that promo is actually being replaced with this   and in addition to this one you've also  got the choice of either the whopper the   impossible whopper a nine piece chicken fry the  original chicken sandwich as well as the big fish   sandwich so you've got plenty of choices on that  two for six but i gotta admit with the addition   of this one right now this is a pretty nice  alternative outside of the bacon king actually   guys because honestly it's a quarter pounder  with cheese essentially just done the bk way   so yeah i'm definitely digging the single  variant of the double quarter pound king   which i actually reviewed back in 2018  when it first came out so it's nice to   have the option of having a little less  meat and honestly i'm not missing the   extra patty on this so much because of all the  flavorfulness of the toppings anyway on this   you're getting a lot of goodness here all right  so let's go for one more bite in this one then   we'll wrap this review up after the rating coming  up next but guys a very very tasty version of what   bk does very well over here it's plenty of nice  beefy flavor lots of creamy cheese naturally with   the two slices and very very flavorful toppings  one more bite we'll finish this one up hang on yes sir just the right amount of saltiness to  go with the crisp bite of the pickles on this   one guys that combination is amazing along with  the onions and of course the bite of the mustard   and the ketchup combination together it just works  very well along with the flame grilled flavor of   the beef over here just a nice addition and it's  even better with a 2 for $6 that's an easy   recommendation very very solid well this single  quarter pound king is technically a king burger   in name only as far as i'm concerned because  the true king burgers have double meat but   naturally because this is a burger king burger  i kind of see the duality of what they're doing   right there and obviously they can't call it a  quarter pounder with cheese so to speak because   of the other guys i get that but like i said what  this does well it does extremely well and i gotta   say it's all the flavors of bk that you already  know definitely banging stuff so with that said   and especially because it's part of a very cool  promo 2 for $6 is awesome for that i'm gonna   have to give the single quarter pound king here  at bk a rock solid 8 out of 10 guys it's   delicious goodness all around and like i said 2  for $6 you can't fade that at all it's definitely   a banging value especially when you pair it up  with one of the other ones on that selection   and you've got some great stuff to choose from  there alright so now the obvious question are   you gonna be giving this one a shot are you gonna  try the single variant of the quarter pound king   over here at bk and if you do when you go for the  2 for $6 are you gonna go for two of the same   one or if not which one are you gonna be choosing  to go with it drop some comments down below and   definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K  closing out another high quality foodie feature   for you here on peep
