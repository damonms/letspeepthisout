 hey everyone welcome or welcome back to  the channel it's Ian K where today i'm   over at jack in the box to take a look at the  latest version of their fan favorite tiny tacos   that's right so stay tuned because  the nacho tiny tacos are up next   welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty all right so right off the top before we get  started on this one let me just say one of the   things that i really like about jack aside from  checking out all their fun promo items here on   the channel is the marketing for those said  promo items i gotta say guys they are really   pretty much spot on with what they actually have  going here and i'm totally digging the fact that   you can really tell this is specifically for the  nacho cheese goodness of what we're about to check   out right now for these tiny tacos so without  further ado let's do just that guys feast your   eyes on their all-new nacho tiny tacos a nice  crispy amount of goodness i have in this little   box here right now guys these are looking really  really cool and definitely coated with that cheesy   goodness all right so what these fan favorite  tiny tacos consist of our mini corn tortilla   shells as you can see here the grains are pretty  nice on the outside and they're dusted with   nacho cheese seasoning and you can tell there's a  decent amount of that on the inside it's designed   to deliver a nacho cheese flavor in every bite  and naturally on the inside that should combine   pretty nicely with what's supposed to be like a  little chicken puree type of filling with little   other spices and stuff that it's got with it but  guys again really really slick on this one and   i'm really digging the presentation and how deeply  coated they appear to be with that cheesy goodness   and for a little dipping action they're actually  promoting this one with ranch which is actually   a very very solid choice when it comes  to the tacos over here at jack in the box   so yeah a pretty nice presentation with this one  and i gotta say that cheesy aroma in my car right   now is strong it's almost got a vibe of like  doritos nacho cheese it's very very strong and   pungent with that so let me pick one of these  up to show you really really nice combination   of crispy goodness here as it tries to focus  in there we go as you can see very very nicely   coated on this one and on the inside that chicken  puree type mixture it's kind of tough to see just   a little bit here let me just see if i can just  open this for you just a bit there you go on the   inside it's a little bit of heaven right there  with that flavor i got to tell you it's nothing   really special to look at but it really tastes  pretty good and as you can see again that cheesy   dusting on the outside so without further ado  let's see exactly how amazing these appear to   hopefully taste here we go guys the brand new  nacho tiny tacos over here jack in the box right up front cheesy flavor and then dovetailing  into that chicken mixture it's almost like a bean   type of texture that it's got but wow light  spicing on top of that but i am totally digging   the flavor of the nacho cheese that they've got  with this guys this is really really tasty a   little bit of that heat is kind of building these  are not spicy and there not supposed to be but   i'm really digging the overall cheesy flavor what  we've got going here right now let's keep going in oh yeah i knew i was going to like these because  i've enjoyed all the versions that they've   actually had up to this point but with the cheesy  goodness that this has got oh yeah look at this   guys this is really nice super sunny today so it's  trying to focus in there you go very simple on   this one it's a little shake shake shake into the  box but that nacho seasoning is really really nice   on this guys and i really dig the fact that it's  so super aromatic to go with that flavor so it's   already setting you up big time in your nostrils  before you even bite into these let's keep going crunchy goodness oh yeah here  you can see on the inside   it looks almost like bean goodness but there's  supposed to be a chicken puree mixed with it but   very flavorful a little high in the salt  department overall but super super tasty i got to keep giving you the close-ups on this  one guys and this is probably looking like a   huge taco on your screen with the exception of  the perspective of my fingers that are holding   it but as you can see it's a pretty nice mini  doppelganger to the regular tacos that they   have over here and again they're super fun to eat  and with that coating on the outside being nacho   cheese how could you really hate on this these are  really really fun to eat and they're very tasty   so yeah i had a feeling i was going to like these  guys because even with any form of generic nacho   cheese seasoning that was only going to elevate  what this already is which is a pretty fun tasty   snack and considering like i said earlier as well  that i've actually done plenty of these reviews   over here at jack in the box all the reviews that  you're seeing jumping up on your screen here right   now all of the tiny taco variants have been a  pretty banging situation whether they're spicy   whether they're loaded whether they're regular it  doesn't really matter but the fact that you've got   cheese flavored now that is a lovely situation  indeed so you definitely know they've got it   going on when it comes to flavor in general but  of course we gotta go for a dip in some ranch   so let's hit that up all right so let's get set  up here i've got everything on my trusty tray in   front of me and let's go for a dip try and keep  that focus in there for you nice creamy action   with that ranch it's only going to elevate the  cheesy goodness i'm sure with that guys take a   look at that nice and thick let's give  this a shot nacho tiny tacos with ranch oh yeah instant nacho seasoning with  the creamy tartness of the ranch and   the crunchiness of the tiny taco oh yeah super  fun snack on this one and definitely a perfect   add-on to go with these tiny  tacos the ranch is banging man let's go for one more i'm starting  off with a 15 piece of these and i've   got plenty in the box here still  wow these are super super tasty   super rich tasting with that ranch  lovely situation another couple of bites man so good so good right now guys last one  here before we round this out here as you can see   again ranch goodness with the tacos over  here jack-in-the-box whether it's the   regular tacos these new tiny tacos with  this taco seasoning the nacho goodness   easy recommendation to give this one a shot  easy recommendation one more bite hang on all right so here's another close-up shot before  we round the review out with the rating coming up   next but guys a super fun snack over here jack in  the box and i'm sure they're really going to run   with the marketing on this one it's such a great  add-on and it's kind of giving me a vibe of the   doritos locos taco from taco bell even though  the inside's a little different the flavor of   that cheese seasoning the nacho cheese goodness  on the outside is super pungent very vibrant very   aromatic and you instantly know what you're going  to get into when you open up the box on this one   very very solid in the aroma department and it's  got the flavor to match banging order on uber eats   postmates and grubhub so jumping right to the  rating i'm going to have to give the all new nacho   tiny tacos here at jack in the box a rock solid 9  out of 10 guys just a beautiful situation across   the board and like i said it delivers not only an  aroma but in flavor and that's really where you   want it to count on top of that naturally you want  to be appetizing when you smell it but when you   taste it that's where it takes off it's a little  high in the salt though in terms of my opinion but   overall what you're getting is a very nice cheesy  outer texture only because it's got that powdery   vibe but at the same time the flavor is absolutely  there and honestly the only way that i can really   see to improve upon these is maybe adding a  little bacon a little bit of cheese and they   actually have a loaded version that features both  which you're probably going to see here on the   channel very soon but let me just say as it stands  right now a beautiful situation $3.50 for a 15 piece   and they deliver on flavor pretty awesome okay  so if you've got jack in the box in the area and   you've given these a shot already do me a quick  favor drop some comments down below how do you   think these rank in terms of the overall versions  that they've had in the past there naturally with   the spicy and the regular that they came out with  even the loaded what do you actually think of the   nacho flavor of these brand new ones drop some  comments down below and definitely let me know and   with that this is Ian K closing out another high  quality foodie feature for you here on peep this   out reviews bringing you brand new content every  single week here on my channel so while you stay tuned for   the next review coming real soon in the meantime  stay frosty yes sir some pretty fun marketing   to go with this and i would expect nothing less  from jack because they definitely excel in that   department but when you have a really tasty snack  on top of it featuring one of my all-time favorite   things which is cheese guys that's a win-win  right there on top of the marketing the flavor to   match the aroma to match a banging situation all  right guys until next time i'll talk to you soon   hey thanks for checking out another one  of my reviews but just in case you didn't   see the one before this one you can find it  right up over here along with what i think   youtube's gonna recommend for you to check  out as well as always i think you'll find   something to like in both of them and i'll  definitely catch you in the next one see ya
