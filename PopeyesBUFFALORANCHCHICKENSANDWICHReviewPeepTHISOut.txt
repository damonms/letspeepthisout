 what's going on everyone and welcome or  welcome back to the channel it's Ian K   where today i'm over at popeyes to check out the  new version of their popular chicken sandwich   they've got on the menu now available for a  limited time only that's right so stay tuned   because the buffalo ranch is up next welcome  to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty well it took 'em a little while but we finally  have a new version guys feast your eyes on the   all-new buffalo ranch chicken sandwich here at  popeyes and as you're gonna see we've got a lot   of fried crispy goodness on display for you along  with some pretty nice looking pickles on the very   bottom let's break this one down real quick  all right so right off the top we've got their   signature buttery toasted brioche guys and once we  pop it you're gonna see underneath we've got just   a little dollop of that buffalo ranch spread right  there but naturally as we pan down you're gonna   see there's more of it on top of their hand breaded  chicken breasts i gotta say that fillet is looking   pretty nice dipped in buttermilk batter and fried  to a crispy golden brown it definitely fills out   this bun pretty nicely underneath it we've got  a couple of their trademark pickle slices right   here along with more of that buffalo ranch spread  and it looks like there's considerably more of it   which is a good thing but guys i got to be honest  i'm very curious to see if this is going to be   just a combination of their bayou buffalo sauce  along with their buttermilk ranch so that's going   to be something we'll try as we get further  into the review but as you're going to see   a pretty nice looking chicken sandwich nonetheless  so let's not waste any more time on this one this   is the all-new buffalo ranch chicken sandwich  here at popeyes let's peep out this flavor   yes sir the infamous chicken sandwich over  here at popeye is made famous thanks to their   call out naturally of chick-fil-a back in the  day aside from the quality just being really   tasty there was a huge marketing blast with  this one you guys remember it a few years ago   now we've finally got something else on the  menu outside of the classic and the spicy   a little bit of the combination of the two i'm  thinking here's some heat and some creaminess   we're gonna see if it's gonna have both of  those things so without further ado here we   go finally it's the buffalo ranch chicken  sandwich here at popeyes let's peep this out good chicken well i got a nice little end  piece of the chicken along with some of   the sauce and the pickles guys and so far this  is what i'm expecting it to be a little bit of   buttermilk ranch goodness along with some  of the heat of buffalo with this one here   let's keep going in though but  as you're going to see very tasty   nonetheless at least in the appearance  department right let's keep going in yeah i'm getting a nice tingle of buffalo along  with the creaminess of ranch with this one guys   it's not nearly as hot as i thought it was  going to be just a little bit of a sizzle   right there it's not bad for what you're  getting here but naturally very familiar   because the chicken is really standing out  it's very familiar in that flavor department   for popeyes along with those pickles on the bottom  but so far guys not bad for this chicken sandwich   but again it's more of a tingly sensation  when it comes to the buffalo heat on this   one i mean the flavor is a little bit subdued  and i gotta be honest guys after coming off   of the shake shack buffalo chicken sandwich not  that long ago which i actually reviewed in test   market you're probably seeing that jumping up  on your screen here right now the shake shack   variant i have to admit was a little bit more  up front in terms of the overall buffalo flavor   this is a lot more subdued but more of a  creamy type of base more mayo type of base   in terms of the thickness but so far it's  not too bad let's just keep going in on it all right i took out a nice chunk of the middle  section of this chicken with that last bite   guys along with a decent amount of the sauce and  again the sizzle is not getting much higher than   the initial first couple of bites that i've  had on this one it's tasty for what this is   but again that buffalo heat is just not  there and the flavor is very subdued so   honestly guys i really want to have a little bit  of fun with this one here because i really want   to see if it's going to be just a combination of  these guys over here so what i'm going to do is   i'm going to open up one of these and i'm going to  open up the other and i think what i'm going to do   because the buttermilk ranch is actually going to  be the creamier of the two i think i'm gonna pour   a little bit of the buffalo into that and then  we're gonna see how this is gonna go so i'm gonna   try and do this very carefully for you hopefully  that's gonna stay focused there but as you're   seeing there a lot of that goodness on the inside  and what i'm going to do is stir it up just a bit   and i'm going to put some of this actually on the  sandwich in one section that doesn't have any of   the sauce really here so i'm going to see if this  is actually going to be worthy of uh what we've   got here right now and if it's a combination  of the two that's not gonna be a bad thing but   uh very curious to see how this is gonna go so   let me put this down here really fast and we'll  take up this section here here we go all right so   let me lift this up and show you upside down  what we've got is that bayou buffalo and the   buttermilk ranch together and then naturally you  can see it's a little bit darker with the newer   version of it here but how is the flavor on this  version let's give it a shot and see here for you oh it's better more up front yeah now granted the bayou buffalo is going to be  a little bit more concentrated because of the mix   that i put into the buttermilk ranch but i think  you're going to have a better experience if you   just get this as a plain classic without anything  and then simply add the bayou buffalo and that   buttermilk ranch because guys honestly what you  should be getting here is a little bit more of   a heated situation when it comes to the goodness  that they're advertising here at least but overall   it's not bad it's just that the heat is not really  there it's more of a creamier type of sauce but   again very subdued so i like it but am i gonna get  this one again not in this current version again   i'm gonna go for the classic all by itself without  anything on it and i'll simply add the bayou   buffalo and the buttermilk ranch because guys  honestly this is okay for what it is it's great   to see a different version of the chicken sandwich  but honestly you're probably gonna have a better   time just doing it yourself the way i'm doing it  right now still it's not bad all right so let's go   for one more bite of the official version before  we wrap the review up with the rating coming up   next but guys a tasty chicken sandwich nonetheless  with just a little bit of sizzle but more of the   creamy aspect of it if anything not a bad combo  though one more bite we'll close it out hang on well here's what's left of this one after  destroying the filet earlier in the review   but i got to say guys i'm glad to have  given this one a shot naturally it is a   brand new version officially on the menu over  here outside of the usual classic and spicy   they've had for the last few years so i'm sure  that's enough to get people to give this a go   but at the same time i wish it would  have had just a little bit more sauce   and a little bit more heat overall but  still a pretty tasty chicken sandwich so with that said i'm gonna have to give this new  buffalo ranch chicken sandwich here at popeyes   just an okay 7.5 out of 10 this is  not going to reinvent the wheel for the chicken   sandwich over here naturally it's great to have an  option on the menu outside of the regular classic   and spicy but considering what i got here today  i wish there was just a little bit more sauce   overall in the very top of it it was decent on  the bottom but again that sauce needs to deliver   just a little bit more heat a little bit more  flavor overall to really make it worthwhile but   again what i got here wasn't bad and considering  they're charging a dollar more for this particular   one hey it is what it is it's still pretty tasty  and i would recommend trying it at least once   but on the real and just like i mentioned earlier  in the review just get the bayou buffalo sauce   along with that buttermilk ranch and i think  you're going to be more than satisfied with   what you've got there guys because that's  definitely more flavorful it really was   all right so do me a quick favor drop some  comments down below let me know if you're going   to be giving this one a shot and definitely let me  know if you're going to be getting it separately   with some bayou buffalo as well as buttermilk are  you going to be making your own concoction like i   did right now and if you do give that a go how did  you personally like it compared to the way it's   supposed to come drop those comments down below  and definitely let me know and with that this is   Ian K closing out another high quality foodie  feature for you here on peep this out reviews   bringing you brand new content every single week  here on
