good morning good morning oh awesome   uh let's go for a little bit of hot sauce  actually yeah thanks awesome thanks so much   you as well stay frosty we'll see ya  bye all right guys let's peep this out   so here we go with the all-new double cheese  breakfast tacos here at del taco and it looks   like we're in for a trio of goodness on the inside  of these warm flour tortillas guys and considering   the price point for each of them the size isn't  too bad either so getting it going here at the   top it looks like we've got the egg and cheese  basically the starter double cheese breakfast   taco this is kind of the basic one here featuring  a combination of scrambled eggs cheddar cheese and   queso blanco no meat whatsoever but even still  guys looking pretty tasty and i gotta say again   for the price point not too bad for a buck moving  on down the line is when things get interesting   feast your eyes on the hash browns and bacon a  combination of scrambled eggs hash brown sticks   cheddar cheese queso blanco and crispy bacon  and considering the price of this one $1.69   you're getting a decent amount of filling on  the inside of this taco this is looking pretty   good as well guys definitely nice and rounding us  out we've got the hash browns and beef again the   combination of scrambled eggs hash brown sticks  cheddar cheese and queso blanco and in this case   seasoned beef and again a very nice price point  for what you've got here guys this is looking   pretty hearty as well and the presentation  absolutely inviting on this one so let's   not waste any more time on these let's see  if the flavor is going to deliver overall   these are the all new double cheese breakfast  tacos here at del taco let's peep out this flavor   so yeah like i said earlier i'm definitely not a  morning person but when i saw that queso was on   tap especially a double version of it over here at  del taco for these promo items you better believe   i set my alarm clock to check this one out because  guys i love cheese i love queso in any way shape   or form and naturally for the price point on top  of it with this that's not a bad deal already so   let's start off with the egg and cheese i'm gonna  go for a couple of bites of each of these we'll   do one bite by itself one bite with some hot sauce  and we're gonna see what these have to offer but i   gotta say the ingredients so far guys pretty solid  and again that price point i keep stressing it   these actually feel pretty good considering what  they are let's give this one a shot starting it   off it's the egg and cheese double cheese  breakfast taco here at del taco let's do it it's definitely the starter breakfast taco but  lots of flavor pretty good mmm well i can already   tell the queso blanco is gonna be one of the  major highlights of this already because it's   a signature over here at del taco in general  it's got just the right amount of saltiness   and ultra creaminess to go with it and it feels  really really nice as you're eating this lots of   fluffy scrambled eggs guys this is pretty nice a  very decent amount of the cheddar cheese on top of   it and of course the queso blanco action not bad  whatsoever on this and i gotta say for a starter   taco this is a great way to begin and again i keep  stressing it this is just a buck not bad all right   because i got it ready over here let's go for  a little bit of hot sauce action in this case   del inferno let's give this a go and try it with  a little bit of the egg and the cheese action   but so far i'm really liking this so far guys  the flavor is pretty nice already let's do it come on a little bit of hot sauce egg and cheese  that's all you really need mmm that's very tasty   very tasty indeed definitely digging this and  with the hot sauce a very beautiful combination   so let me give you another shot of the very back  of this one and we'll open this one up just a bit   as you guys can see lots of tasty cheesy goodness  along with the eggs with this one here again   a starter double cheese breakfast  taco but pretty tasty nonetheless   all right let's move on to the hash brown and  bacon another situation here this is more of   a premium item it looks like a whole hash brown  stick with some bacon a little bit of scrambled   egg action that's in there as well and some  grated cheddar cheese and the queso blanco   action let's give this one a shot very very  full feeling in the hands already let's do it crispy hash brown right away smokiness of the  bacon fairly crunchy on the bacon as well and   then the queso is coming in the cheese  the egg nice combination really tasty   yeah this is literally breakfast tastiness right  away with the classic flavors that you'd expect   especially for fast food guys that hash brown is a  very lovely combination on this i'm really digging   the smokiness of that bacon and the crispiness  of everything in here namely that hash brown   let's go for a little bit of the hot sauce  action we'll get some of that in there just   add a little bit to it and i'm really  digging this already i can only imagine   we're about to satisfy that expectation right  now what this is going to be like let's do it hot sauce makes everything better  that's loveliness right there   again smokiness of the bacon crispiness  of the hashbrown those cheese flavors   man these are very tasty and the price  point on this one not bad i think about a   buck 69 beautiful combination on this one guys  a very nice upgrade and like i said all those   classic flavors add a little bit of hot sauce  del inferno is what i kind of recommend with   this one here i think it's the perfect amount  of heat very lovely situation on this by far   all right and now the wild card variant right now  the hash brown and beef guys you can't really have   something over here with del taco without a little  bit of the beef action there's seasoned stuff that   they have on their tacos here this has got to  be a lovely situation let's give this one a shot mmm it is a lovely situation wow  this is my favorite right now easily   you know i gotta say with the hashbrown in this  and that seasoned beef it almost feels like i'm   having like chili fries for some reason  it's got a really really nice rich flavor   the saltiness is perfect with this one  and the combination of the cheesy goodness   the queso everything in this right now  a lovely situation so i can only imagine   and you already know what's coming how this is  going to be with some hot sauce so let me try   and angle that so you guys can see it there we  go let's give this a shot i'm excited right now mm-hmm oh yeah right away this is the banging  variant and its price point is in the mid-range   as well this is like a dollar thirty-nine this  is actually the better of all three right now   i mean if you love bacon you're gonna like  the other one as well but that seasoned beef   lovely situation guys a lovely combination of  everything on this one let me show you the back   of it nice amount of meat on the inside of this as  well guys these are very very tasty the cheese is   very pronounced and again with the queso blanco  being what it is just a lovely combination of   goodness all around this is really tasty breakfast  goodness on a value budget i must say and again if   you're a cheese lover like myself i had a feeling  these were going to be pretty tasty considering   queso blanco is pretty awesome very very delicious  stuff well i got to say i'm really glad i got up   for this one guys a very beautiful situation when  it comes to the amount of queso on the inside of   these and depending upon your choice of protein if  you decide to go that route the seasoned beef is a   pretty banging option over here and of course the  classic flavors of the crispy bacon of course that   has to be on the menu as well but a very nice  combination i'd probably recommend skipping the   starter taco but honestly guys they're all very  tasty they all offer that delicious queso over   here at del taco and the combinations of each  of these work extremely well delicious stuff   and especially on a budget not bad well these  double cheese breakfast tacos are going to be   pretty easy for me to rate right now based upon my  initial impressions so starting off with that egg   and cheese that one's going to get a pretty solid  7 out of 10 like i said that's a starter taco to   really kind of get this one going it's just egg  and cheese it's pretty basic for what it is but   when you add that hot sauce into the mix a lovely  situation now as for the hash brown and bacon guys   that's where things kind of get interesting and  that one's gonna get a very easy 8 out of 10   the smoky flavors of that bacon the combination  of the cheeses the crunchiness of the hash brown   a beautiful situation in general and again add in  some hot sauce a banging situation there and as   for the hash browns and beef that's obviously  gonna be the top for me so that one's an easy   9 out of 10 the combination of that taco meat  the seasoned goodness on the inside with it is a   beautiful combination along with the crunchiness  of the hashbrown and again i was getting chili   cheese vibes with that and i really like that  because of all the cheese in that one in general   but the combination is amazing for a dollar  39 at least you can't fade that at all add in   some hot sauce another beautiful combination and  again for all three of these the value is pretty   banging guys and the flavor definitely delivers  solid stuff all right so if you've got del taco   in the area i'm very curious to know if you're  going to be giving these a shot and obviously   if you're going to be giving all three of them  a shot and if you do give them a go which one   is your personal favorite and why drop those  comments down below and
