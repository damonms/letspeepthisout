 hey everyone welcome back to another high quality  foodie feature for you here on the channel where   this time i'm back on over at shake shack to check  out a selection off of their all new hot honey   menu and guys judging by what you're looking at  on screen right now this is looking pretty tasty   already so let's get into it feast your eyes on  the hot honey chicken sandwich and already guys   like i said that presentation is killer without a  doubt that chicken in the middle is looking ultra   crispy and i gotta admit that toasted bun that  it's sitting in is looking pretty awesome as well   so let's pop the top and take a look underneath  and what you're gonna find is a very decent amount   of their all-new habanero mayo and that's all on  top of their all new honey glazed crispy chicken   breasts and as you can see guys nice and crispy  nice and golden and obviously the chicken itself   is featuring the usual no antibiotics no hormones  at all it's looking really really crispy guys and   i'm really digging the presentation of it for sure  underneath it and mostly for show i think we've   got some shredded lettuce but guys it's all about  that honey glazed crispy chicken breast here and   i got to admit it is a sizable piece of chicken  on the inside of this potato bun with plenty of   that habanero mayo to go with so let's not waste  any more time on this one this is the all-new hot   honey chicken sandwich here at shake shack let's  peep out this flavor all right so right off the   break i am very thankful we've got that chicken  sandwich diaper in the back because with all that   habanero mayo action and effect guys i'm glad  this is outfitted properly and as you can see   very lovely in the presentation guys nice and  crispy nice and golden and the aroma in my car   right now is a little bit of sweetness on top of it  but i got to admit it's dovetailing nicely with   everything that i'm looking at here right now so  let me peel this one back just a bit and we'll get   this one ready to go again super excited there is  plenty of habanero mayo on this wow amazing whoa wow that is very hot and it's also crispy in my  car right now and as usual i forgot the drink   shoot me i know i always happen to do that when  i do these reviews all right let's not waste any   more time on this one i can already tell this  is going to be a heated situation just with a   little bit of that habanero mayo on my finger  i have a feeling i'm a glutton for punishment   with this one here we go it's the hot honey  chicken sandwich here at shake shack let's do it crunchy sweet goodness oh wow heat man that is seriously good though well  i guess if you've got hot in your name you already   know what to expect this has got a beautiful  amount of heat to it guys with just the right   amount of sweetness on top of it and then the  crispy coating of that chicken itself it's fairly   juicy on top of it and of course the nice softness  of that potato bun guys a lovely situation and   again very glad that i've got the chicken sandwich  diaper behind me here right now this is actually   a serious situation not necessarily behind me but  behind the chicken i think you know what i mean as   you can see guys that white meat gloriousness  is on display for you but guys that habanero   mayo is no joke and when you combine that with the  honey coated goodness of the chicken itself it's a   lethal combination of flavor very beautiful and as  i'm sure most of you guys know shake shack doesn't   necessarily split the buns completely across  when they cut these here so you have a little   bit of a catch-all in the very back but even still  there's so much habanero mayo on the top of this   not necessarily on the bottom but guys i'm so  glad like i said i've got this little sandwich   diaper action right now to catch it but beautiful  stuff here let's go for another bite we'll give   you some more close-ups guys delicious stuff i  was so looking forward to trying this here we go man yeah that honey sweetness is banging man i got  a lot of sauce with that bite and it is really   giving me a little bit of a problem right now  guys on top of the heated situation outside my car   a lovely situation indeed with this and  guys the quality of the chicken on top of it   is so nice even though it's not a super large  piece of chicken in terms of just the width   the height is definitely there so it's thick and  it's a hearty bite and now that i think about it   this is kind of reminding me of the experience of  having that test market buffalo chicken sandwich a   few weeks ago which you're probably seeing jumping  up on your screen here right now definitely check   that one out that was pretty much the same  experience of having that chicken sandwich   just like this one but with the exception of the  heat and that honey glaze on this particular one   but guys the buffalo was pretty banging on  that this is actually better believe it or   not and actually you'd expect it to be because  the habanero mayo is so unique and then you have   the honey glazed crispy goodness of the chicken  itself it's a distinct flavor so let's go for   another couple more bites on this one guys this is  a delicious chicken sandwich right now here we go mmm and i'm also loving the fact that this  catches my style potato bun guys it's got   such a hardiness and softness just to hold it it's  really encasing everything beautifully it's trying   to do its best to absorb all the sauce that's on  this but hey just in case like i said i'm glad   i've got this little chicken sandwich diaper  here let's go in again guys delicious stuff yes sir that lethal combination of  that habanero mayo along with that   honey glazed goodness is really taking  this one to new levels of flavor guys and   considering how awesome the chicken  is anyway over here at shake shack   it's an awesome flavor profile and perfect for  summer because of the heat this is really tasty   so yeah this one is definitely worth your time  guys especially if you've got shake shack in   the area this is a no-brainer to give a try and  if you don't necessarily have them around you   there a small road trip wouldn't be out of the  question either this is worth it to me because   i got to say guys the combination of those  flavors it's pretty banging but hey just in   case you're on the fence about going in on yet  another chicken sandwich option out there in the   market right now you do have the option to get  this hot honey goodness on their chicken bites   as well as their fries and that combination i can  imagine should be pretty tasty but guys the big   gun with the chicken sandwich easy recommendation  on this one it's really not too much else to   say about it it's classic shake shack it's that  beautiful potato bun action the antibiotic-free   hormone-free chicken of course is on display  and it's a nice piece of chicken on top of it   not necessarily the widest piece of chicken but  it's thick and it's definitely hearty one more   bite we'll close this one up after the rating  guys but like i said easy recommendation to give   this one a shot and i'm so glad to have given  this one a shot for you right now pretty great well this one's completely leaking out the back  so let me give you a nice cross-section shot to   round this one out and as you can see that  classic white meat action guys it's nice and   thick nice and hearty goes pretty amazing with the  light crunch that i'm getting from the lettuce in   the very bottom there it's again more for show i  think it's not really doing anything flavor-wise   but it's adding a little bit of textural goodness  to the whole thing here the guys the combination   of the habanero mayo and the honey glazed goodness  of this crispy chicken just a banging combination   and of course on the inside of that potato bun  delicious stuff so with that said i'm going to   have to give the all new hot honey chicken  sandwich here at shake shack a rock solid  9 out of 10 guys the only thing that really hurts  this one and is usually the case with shake shack   is the price point at almost eight dollars for  this it's definitely a premium i mean you do get   what you pay for the quality is good but like i  said they're not really going for that competitive   angle of $3.99 like everybody else tries to do  anyway there's a lot of chicken sandwiches out   there that are definitely above that price point  this is easily one of them but the quality is   banging so am i gonna get this one again probably  i have to admit guys shake shack chicken is pretty   awesome but like i said the price point is still  up there and i wish it was just a little bit less   just a little bit all right so i've got just  one simple question for you this time out do   you personally think this chicken sandwich that i  just reviewed for you right now from shake shack   is worth $7.89 drop those comments down below and  definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K   closing out another high quality foodie feature  for you here on peep this out reviews bringing   you
