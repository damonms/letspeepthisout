before we finish making the burrito it has guacamole on it oh yeah the guacamole is already prepped with pico de gallo which has tomatoes oh that's cool yeah just as long as it's not extra i'm cool yeah thank you brother i appreciate it oh you're looking at $5.51 all right gotcha there you go very cool appreciate it you take care now thank you brother you too stay frosty we'll see ya all right guys let's peep this out so let's get crispy with it it's the epic crispy chicken and guac burrito here at del taco and right off the bat this is definitely looking crispy guys those chicken strips look really really nice it looks like we've got about three of them on the inside and i have this burrito split down the middle to give it that nice cross-section shot and they're definitely striking some pretty nice white meat chicken there on the inside of this oversized tortilla looks like we've got the obvious the crispy fried chicken strips in effect for you it's got a blend of romaine and iceberg lettuce guacamole normally diced tomatoes tortilla strips and a creamy avocado caesar dressing and i gotta say guys this is looking really really good lots of green goodness there looks like a decent amount of guacamole but as you can see the stars of the show those crispy chicken tenders in there are looking really really good so without further ado let's get into this one and see if the flavor is going to deliver it's the epic crispy chicken and guac burrito here at del taco let's peep out this flavor you know chicken strips are easily one of my favorite foods ever since i was a kid really so when i saw the del taco was going to be featuring them in one of their epic burritos let's just say you didn't have to twist my arm very hard to get me over here to give this one a shot and i gotta say so far i'm not disappointed in the presentation of it they look really solid on the inside of this and with all the other goodies around it i have a feeling this is going to be pretty tasty so i'm definitely not going to waste any more time on this one okay i lied maybe just a little bit because like always and before i get started if you guys are fans of high quality delicious looking food reviews make sure to hit that subscribe button down below and don't forget to tap that bell icon so you can be notified as soon as brand new content drops every week guys i'm very excited to do this for you right now it's the epic crispy chicken and guac burrito here at del taco let's do it hmm right off the break right after the initial crunchiness that i'm tasting from the chicken strips you're getting the nice creamy smooth richness of that avocado caesar dressing it's got just the right amount of pungentness to let you know that it is caesar based but then the creaminess of the avo is coming through and then you're getting some nice crunchiness of the tortilla strips but guys pretty tasty so far and even just after that first bite it is very flavorful and as you can see front and center lots of tortilla strips on the inside to add even more crunch to those chicken strips in there as well so a lovely situation and of course the avocado on its own and again with the tomato actually not really being present it's really only in the guacamole i'm kind of tasting it it's not bad but the creaminess of the guacamole that this one has got anyway is doing a number on me right now to let me know that that flavor is standing out above everything else on top of the caesar and of course the crispiness of the chicken which actually guys believe it or not with all my talk of all the other stuff this one has it's actually a fairly decent chicken strip let's just keep going with it yeah this one is definitely a guacamole and avo caesar showcase for sure guys those flavors are the dominant players and naturally with the crispy chicken tenders on the inside they're actually are really really decent and of course on top of that you have the crunchy tortilla strips because why not let's just throw a few in here but guys pretty tasty so far and i'm really digging again the presentation it's looking pretty tasty and obviously the flavor is delivering as i'm guessing you're probably figuring out by this point into the review but i gotta say guys the presentation is solid and i keep coming back to that because naturally with the size of the burrito being what it is it's epic in name for a reason and naturally even with just a half of this it's a pretty solid amount of food on the inside now granted the chicken tenders are long and there's only three of them but they're nice and thick and definitely meaty and overall the flavor is definitely like i said delivering let's go for another bite yeah i'm really digging that avocado caesar dressing on this one and naturally with that blend of the iceberg and the romaine lettuce together you're going to get a little bit more of a caesar salad type of vibe with this but with the creaminess of the guacamole and considering the amount that's in here it's a nice combination and then when you add the chicken strips again it's almost like you're eating a chicken caesar salad wrapped up on the inside of this my only gripe though is that i'm really wishing there's a little bit of queso in here how could there not be any type of cheese now i get the kind of selling on the whole caesar thing and the guacamole thing and everything else with this one the crunchiness of the tenders naturally but a little bit of queso just for presentation and extra flavor would have gone a long way but still very solid all right so let me go for one more bite of this one after the final close-up and then we'll close this one out after the rating coming up in a sec but guys very very tasty and like i said earlier being that i'm a fan of chicken strips this one is absolutely delivering because the quality of those strips is solid with everything else this one has got going on the inside so final bite and we'll close this one out so here's a shot of the other half and as you can see not too shabby in the chicken strip department guys that meat-to-breading ratio is solid as you can see the solid white meat on the inside there and of course with the breading not really taking up a lot of the space everything else is doing a nice job of doing that and as you can see plenty of the crunchy tortilla strips to add even more crunch to this one and lots of the greenery here guys this is just a very tasty situation i only wish there was a little bit of queso to go with but as it stands it's still pretty solid so with that said i'm gonna have to give the appropriately named epic crispy chicken and guac burrito here at del taco a rock solid 8.2 out of 10 this one easily could have been kicked up by you guessed it some queso but what you're getting here for the money for five bucks is a lot of food still and the flavor absolutely delivers especially in the avo and the caesar dressing and of course the extra guacamole guys just a lovely situation overall and an easy recommendation to try all right two quick questions for you first and foremost are you a fan of chicken strips are they one of your favorite foods and secondly what do you think about the idea of having them inside of a burrito does that sound really good to you drop those comments down below and definitely let me
