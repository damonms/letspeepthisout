 hey everyone welcome or welcome back  to the channel it's Ian K where today   i'm over at taco bell to check out the return  of one of their most popular menu items ever   now available in a cool new flavor that's  right and it's supposed to be heated too   so stay tuned because the flamin hot cool  ranch doritos locos taco supreme is up next   welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty all right right off the break let me just say this  makes total sense that they would actually have   a flavor that combines flamin hot and cool ranch  together in one over here at taco bell being that   they already have the chips that are doing that  on the shelves right now as well this is beautiful   market if you ask me guys and considering that  i actually checked out the regular flaming hot   doritos locos taco supreme variant the last time  around i'm so glad to be adding some cool ranch   goodness to this right now so guys without further  ado here we go the flamin hot cool ranch doritos   locos taco supreme variant over here at taco bell  and i gotta say the dusting is looking really nice   on the outside you can tell this has got the  cool ranch goodness to go with that flamin hot   all right so breaking this one down from  outside in what we've got here is a corn   taco shell dusted with the good stuff the  flamin hot and cool ranch dorito seasoning   and as you can see it is pretty plentiful and that  striking red is looking pretty nice on this one   on the inside it's all the usual goodies from  taco bell there's seasoned beef shredded lettuce   diced tomatoes reduced fat sour cream and shredded  cheddar cheese on the top for even more color but   i gotta say guys it's all about the shell on this  one and i'm really digging the appearance of it it   really looks pretty solid and let me also say i'm  so glad that these actually come with these little   trays these little sleeves that you're looking  at here because of all the dusty goodness you're   gonna get on your fingers otherwise it's also  a nice little holder to give this one a shot so   without further ado let's do just that guys  it's the brand new flamin hot cool ranch   doritos locos tacos supreme variant over here at  taco bell crazy mouthful of a title let's do it the sour cream with the flamin hot already  then the beef cool ranch seasoning coming   in on the back slight sizzle nothing  crazy it's not really flamin hot but wow   that flavor is pretty banging and it looks like  i lost a little off the top here i got a little   chip of that flamin hot goodness right over  here guys let me show this to you there hopefully   that'll focus in focus focus focus there we go  a little bit of seasoning action pretty tasty   i'm digging it well this is the standard  taco bell goodness through and through with   that seasoned beef of course on the bottom guys  and it goes so beautifully with the sour cream   of course the lettuce to go with it as well the  tomato goodness on the very top there as well   too which i'm not really tasting too much of  because of the flavor of the flamin hot shell   and speaking of that guys the dusting is beautiful  on this that cool ranch is really coming through   and it really is a nice duality along  with the flamin hot goodness of it   itself and the appearance is super  striking i'm definitely digging that   yeah this sure is a fun variant to go in on guys  like i said the sour cream over here goes so   beautifully with everything on the inside and the  fact that that's what really makes it essentially   the supreme here basically the tomatoes and sour  cream added to this i'm really loving the fact   that the sour cream itself blends beautifully  with the shell itself on the outside as well   along with that cool ranch goodness so we're gonna  go for another few more bites in this one but i   definitely want to do some hot sauce let's go for  one more bite before we do that guys pretty good it's super messy to eat and thankfully like  i said i'm glad we've got these sleeves to go   with but it's messy in the best most possible way  and i'm not complaining at all because the flavor   is pretty good so speaking of flavor let's go  for a little bit of diablo sauce you might as   well take this to the limit right i mean flamin  hot's supposed to be really hot anyway which it   isn't on this one per se but with diablo sauce  let's see what we can do diablo problem solved   all right so let me rip this open and we'll go for a little bit on here hopefully  that's going to keep the focus for you there   my focus needs focus up dripping on down below   let's give this a shot we'll load it up  pretty nicely here let's give it a go   and real quick before i take that bite one  more shot right in the front here very lovely   situation of that diablo sauce along with that  sour cream right behind it let's give this a shot mmm oh yeah yes that diablo is good a little  bit of an elevated heat but nothing crazy   the sour cream is muting everything  but still the flavor is beautiful   the seasoning is beautiful the flamin hot look  is beautiful on top of the cool ranch goodness   guys very very nice indeed on this one very very  nice indeed and again combination of any of your   sauces is going to go pretty amazing with this  but it's a very authentic flamin hot flavor to   go with everything that you've got here right now  pretty pretty nice one more bite we'll close this   review up with the rating coming up next but  guys it's another tasty variant of an all-time   classic already over here to talk about one of the  biggest items ever before the nacho fries came out   and it's still an awesome item one more bite and  we'll close it out coming up next hang on yes there's some beautiful cool ranch goodness  that comes up as a back end accent on top of the   flamin hot guys it's really done very well and  the coating is pretty prevalent all throughout   this taco and i have to say again the combination  of the two works amazing with the sour cream along   with the beef just everything on the inside of  this is very nicely done and as you can see that   sour cream is lighting up beautifully right  there guys something very cool to check out   and obviously if you're a fan of this  to begin with you probably already have   very very tasty order ahead and pick  yours up at our contactless drive-thru   so with that i'm gonna have to give the new  flamin hot cool ranch doritos locos taco over   here at taco bell definitely a mouthful of  a title by the way again a pretty rock solid   9 out of 10 super long title notwithstanding  it's got some super amazing flavor to go with   guys i mean that really is the quintessential  flavor of taco bell all inside of a famous shell   that features the familiar flavors of flamin hot  as well as cool ranch at the very end which i   really like and the combination of the sour cream  to go with the thing that makes it the supreme on   top of the tomatoes which i'm not really tasting  does a very very solid job overall at $2.99 the   price point is just a little up there for it but  at the same time you're paying for the marketing   you're paying for the name and it is a quality  made taco over here especially for fast food nice   job taco bell nice job all right so do me a quick  favor drop some comments down below let me know   if this is your all-time favorite taco over here  at taco bell and are you glad that they finally   added cool ranch to the mix along with flamin  hot drop those comments down below and definitely   let me know and with that this is Ian K closing  out another high quality foodie feature for you   here on peep this out reviews bringing you brand  new content every single week here on my channel   so while you stay tuned for that next review coming real soon  in the meantime stay frosty yes sir that diablo   sauce really lit this one up pretty nicely let me  just say i'm so glad this is back on the menu but   if they really want to do something solid by their  fans right now i would highly recommend making   this a permanent option along with the nacho fries  i mean at this point these need to be a permanent   fixture on the menu who wouldn't want to have this  any time that they'd want to get it without having   to worry that it's leaving anytime soon pretty  nice guys the cool ranch is pretty banging all   right everyone until next time i'll talk to you  soon hey thanks for checking out another one of   my reviews but just in case you didn't see the one  before this one you can find it right up over here   alone what i think youtube's going to recommend  for you to check out as well as always i think   you'll find something to like in both of them and  i'll definitely catch you in the next one see ya
