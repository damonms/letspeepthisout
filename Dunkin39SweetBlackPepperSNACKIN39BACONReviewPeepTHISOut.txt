 hey everyone I'm back at it this time here at Dunkin because apparently they've got bacon available as a snack that's right I can't believe it either so stay tuned because it's up next welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty they say America runs on Dunkin and if you're a fan of bacon you've got another reason to jump on over guys feast your eyes on the snackin bacon this is definitely a very crispy tasty looking situation we've got here 8 half slices of bacon with a sweet black pepper seasoning all throughout here and I got to say this doesn't look too bad $2.29 for a little snack bag here and this is looking really really nice definitely crispy you can definitely see plenty of the pepper seasoning and all the other goodies here so let's see if this one's gonna deliver guys this looks like a pretty tasty snack it's the snackin bacon here at Dunkin let's peep out this flavor so snackin bacon I figured what better way to test out some of the capabilities of my new Samsung Galaxy  S20+ than going in on something like this just to kind of check it out play around with some of the settings see if you guys actually like what you're seeing right now I'm not sure if I'm gonna be releasing this video but if you guys are watching this on my channel right now chances are you know I made that decision already but guys snackin bacon how bad can this really be well hopefully not too bad at all so before I confirm the tastiness that I'm thinking this is gonna deliver if you guys are fans of high-quality delicious looking food reviews make sure to hit that

seasoning on this on top of it 8 slices $2.29 not a bad price let's see how amazing it is hmm that's very sweet actually oh yeah yeah hickory-smoked is pretty good not overly crispy just a little dry I want to say it's almost like a jerky actually nice quality though I mean as you guys can see here really really nice a little bit of the fattiness on the top there but that's part of the fun of it naturally the black pepper seasoning decent as well and the overall flavor I got to admit it's not bad guys I mean each slices little over two bucks is it expensive your mileage may vary I never thought about having something like this as a meal so to speak I mean it is a snack technically but it's okay it is sweet though it's Dunkin right it's gonna be sweet really digging the half strip size it's kind of fun to eat this way and again as you guys can see plenty of that seasoning in there guys this is really really cool and really digging this actually and kind of fun selling a little bag of bacon as a snack the black pepper maybe just a little bit of heat from that but it's mostly the crystallization of the sugar that I'm kind of tasting the sweetness coming through but with the hickory smoked goodness that this has got as well that's a lovely situation mmm very nice all right being that I'm a fan of low carb diets on top of it I actually manage my macros daily based upon my diet naturally so with this obviously with this having some sugar on it it's not exactly carb free so to speak because of the sugar it may be fat-free essentially but naturally saturated fat in the bacon all that good stuff but as a snack guys you can't go wrong with this this is actually pretty nice if you're at Dunkin you want to try something different it's a little on the flop side but actually the rigidness is actually not too bad here guys as you can see but again seasoned up beautifully and definitely a pretty tasty alternative to probably a donut that you might get otherwise but naturally if you're going for bacon manage the saturated fat accordingly of course and again it's more beef jerky like than anything else so not served hot I'm glad about that actually I think it works better like this and the fact that it's reminding me a beef jerky a little bit more is a plus so not too bad okay so with that said I'm gonna have to give this snackin bacon here a Dunkin I never thought I'd be having a little bag of bacon from Dunkin Donuts or Dunkin actually because they dropped the name I'm gonna have to give it a pretty decent 7.5 out of 10 I mean the flavor is good it delivers the pepper it delivers a sweetness a nice hickory smoke of the bacon itself is good and overall for a little over 2 bucks it's not too horrible just to try it at least once so it's fun for what it is it's sweet a little bit of light heat but mostly that bacon flavor that you're looking for the candy bacon goodness how bad could that really be right like I said in the beginning how bad could this really be it's candy bacon so do me a quick favor let me know if you can actually tell me there's a reason that you don't want to try something like this in the comments down below drop
