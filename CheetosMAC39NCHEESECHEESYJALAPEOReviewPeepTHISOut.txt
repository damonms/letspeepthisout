 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty it's not easy being cheesy alright here we go with another high quality foodie feature for you with Ian K here on peep this out reviews going in on another flavor of the all-new cheetos mac and cheese guys feast your eyes on the cheesy jalapeno a definitely lovely situation here i'm absolutely loving these little containers they come in and as you guys can see on the very top here this looks like a little bit more of a muted version of the bold and cheesy that i just did i'll make sure to put that review popping up on your screen here right now so you can check it out if you haven't already but it looks like it's a little bit lesser in terms of color the orange color looks a little bit more muted but i gotta say again i love the packaging i love the control portion size with this 2 and 25 ounces on this one compared to the other one i think it was like 2 and 3/4 and change or something like that but as you can see again before i dive in standard spiral goodness here guys actually i gotta say again the prep on this is super easy you simply pull the little packet out of the top of this fill up the cup to the water line you stir it up for a bit and then naturally you drop it into the microwave for about three minutes or so and then after that pour in the goodness in this case the cheesy jalapeno and then stir it up for a little bit and then naturally you're gonna have a little mini lunch to go right there and again i am really digging that there guys it's looking really really good so without further ado let's see what this one is going to be like flavor-wise i'm expecting a little bit of heat because i can kind of smell it believe it or not i do actually smell the jalapeno pretty nicely there and as you can see again looks like standard mac and cheese it'll spiral action let me give it a shot again nice and al dente i can already tell i made it myself let's give it a go oh yeah and there comes a little bit of that heat right there that's a little bit stronger than i was expecting i mean i can smell it naturally but wow that is a nice little residual burn more on the back of the throat than anything else but again i am really digging the cheesiness of this guys as you can see wow that's really beginning to pack up a little bit of heat there it's not like this is flamin' or anything i mean come on but you know this is really a little bit more heated and i like that and naturally i think it's the amount of water in here during the prep that's really making the difference because when you mix it with the cheese powder that this comes with because it seems a little bit more you have more water in it naturally it's going to make more of a thicker sauce more concentrated that's what i'm getting let's keep going with it yeah this is really good i am really digging this a lot and apparently so is chester cheetah himself right there take a look at that he's got a nice big old spoon of it right there too so very very slick guys and again i love the controlled portion size with this the quality is pretty nice it really does feel like it kicked up kraft mac and cheese still but it's got the marketing it's got the name and just a cool presentation overall so one more bite we'll finish this one out after the rating but think of this one like the other one that i did and you can find that review in the upper right hand corner but naturally with a little bit of spice add it into the mix so very cool and because it's a green container of course you know it's jalapeno right it's very easy to spot so yeah very very tasty on this one overall on that scale of 1 to 10 i'm probably gonna go a solid 8 with this one i still like the first one that i did the bold and cheesy because it was a little bit more of a pronounced cheesy flavor this is more muted but with a little bit more of the jalapeno action there so the quality is good like i said there's really no way to mess this up three minutes in the microwave with the amount of water that it's asking for and then add the uh the powdered goodness and then you're ready to roll so again quality is pretty nice on this guys pretty nice all right so quick question before we finish this one out how do you guys feel about the cup versions of mac and cheese would you rather actually prepare it with the larger boxes like like standard like the Kraft style would you rather have a controlled portion that you can kind of enjoy and kind of sit in say your mobile studio per say what do you guys think drop those comments down below and definitely let me know and if you guys are keeping score with process of elimination you obviously know the flamin' hot version is coming very very soon so with that this is
