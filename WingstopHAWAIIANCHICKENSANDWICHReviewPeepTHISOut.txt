 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty what's going on everyone and welcome to the  channel where today i'm back on over at you   guessed it wingstop to check out another one  of the flavors they've got available for their   all-new chicken sandwich and this one is actually  one that i don't get too often if ever guys feast   your eyes on what i've got here it's the hawaiian  chicken sandwich and as you can see a lot of saucy   goodness still going with these chicken sandwiches  let's break this one on down real fast all right   so starting us off and just like the other  versions of this chicken sandwich you've already   checked out we've got a soft yet toasted buttery  bun and once we pop it you're gonna notice right   away we've got four very nice looking pickles  contrasting beautifully with the chicken itself   i'm definitely digging the way those look already  underneath those pickles is the main star of the   show an all-white meat chicken breast that is  breaded up and fried to a crispy golden brown and   then it's thrown into that hawaiian goodness that  you're looking at here guys described as a blend   of sweet and tangy island citrus and asian flavors  and i gotta say this is looking really nice   almost like a sweet and sour vibe from mickey d's  i'm getting with this one but it looks really nice   and it's definitely sauced up again the color  contrast with those pickles is pretty awesome   off to the side and as expected we've got a little  side of their house ranch which is always a lovely   situation so of course we're going to be getting  into that with this chicken sandwich but speaking   of that chicken sandwich again i'm totally  digging the contrast of the way the sauce   looks on top of those pickles nice and golden so  let's not waste any more time on this one it's the   hawaiian variant of the all-new chicken sandwich  here at wingstop let's peep out this flavor   yes sir definitely a very saucy situation i  love the fact that they're very generous with   the amount of sauce on these sandwiches guys  it is fully coated and again i'm getting vibes   of sweet and sour with this one let me see  if i can kind of confirm that flavor for you   because honestly i don't really remember what  the hawaiian flavor tastes like over here wingstop   so this is completely new for me and  hopefully for you guys as well here we go   it's the hawaiian variant of the new chicken  sandwich here at wingstop let's peep this out wow that is crazy flavorful guys it's very  sweet but i am totally digging the whole   citrus feel with this one here it really  is up there in terms of sugar and the   saltiness of the chicken itself is comboing  beautifully along with the pickles guys   very very nice on this let's go for another  bite we're definitely getting into some   ranch i can't wait to try that but this is  pretty banging already let's keep going in you know this almost feels like a heightened  orange type of sauce guys i am totally digging   the citrus quality with this one it almost  kind of reminds me of like a duck sauce or   something along those lines but again  the combo with the pickles is lovely   and it really goes very nicely with the thickness  of this chicken along with the bun so far i am   totally digging the flavor on this variation  but naturally given the sugar level for this   one already i'm very curious to see how it's  going to go with some ranch so without further   ado let's just segue right into that and hopefully  that's going to stay as focused as it can for you   i'm pouring a lot of it on here right now let's  give this a shot guys some ranch along with   the hawaiian goodness asian flair with some  citrus island goodness let's peep this out it's different i like it but it's different  well the combination of the tartness and the   creaminess of the ranch is dovetailing right into  the sweet and tangy action of that hawaiian sauce   guys it's different don't get me wrong i like it  but it is definitely nothing like i've ever had   over here at wingstop for sure the combination of  that creaminess with the citrusy goodness is like   i said different that's really the best way to  describe it so i like it it's not bad but again   it's on top of a very beautiful piece of chicken  and again just to keep showing it to you guys   it really fills out this bun pretty nicely a  decent amount of sauce the pickles are amazing   with it and it really is another variation i'm  glad to have checked out like i said hawaiian   is not really my thing but i'm glad to have done  this one on camera for you guys because naturally   i was very curious about this flavor all right  so let's go for one more bite on this one and   naturally we'll go for more ranch action to go  with and then we'll uh of course wrap the review   with the rating coming up next but guys like i  said a very different flavor profile with this one   uh but it does fit the mode of what you'd expect  from wingstop especially with the ranch that's   kind of dripping all the way down here we  go one more bite and we'll wrap it up hang on well pay no mind to that pickle that's  sticking out there to say hello to you   guys what you've got here still is a very  tasty chicken sandwich here at wingstop   even though the ranch is a little different  with the hawaiian sauce some of you may like   it some of you may not some of you may be in  the middle of it kind of like i am right now   but it is actually pretty tasty totally digging  this variation of the chicken sandwich and again   i'm glad to have checked this out officially on  camera in front of you guys not bad on this one   so with that said i'm gonna have to give the  hawaiian chicken sandwich here at wingstop   just an okay 7 out of 10 it's a pretty tasty  chicken sandwich don't get me wrong guys and again   it's gonna come down to your flavor of sauce that  they've got available on the menu over here and   actually with over 12 of them to go in on you have  more than enough choice and with that particular   one with the blend of the island citrus goodness  the sweet and the tangy i can see where they're   going for with the asian flair with that one you  kind of get a little bit of that it almost feels   almost like a duck sauce type of situation but  at the same time it's still a very tasty chicken   sandwich but again mixing it with ranch a little  strange just a little all right so for any of you   peeps out there who really dig the hawaiian flavor  over here at wingstop because like i said this is   one of my first times giving this one a go just  solo dolo on top of a chicken sandwich right now   drop some comments down below let me know what you  think of this particular flavor in general
