because the chicken cheddar ranch sandwich is up next welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty let's get into it it's the chicken cheddar round sandwich here at Arby's part of the two for six and already we are being greeted by those chicken tenders popping out the middle right over there guys starting off with the toasted bun on the top I've seeded goodness let's take a look underneath it looks like we have got plenty of that parmesan peppercorn ranch action right there a slice of cheddar cheese and underneath that obviously we've got the protein looks like a couple of their breaded chicken tenders in effect a little on the small side but let's just keep going with it underneath this we have got some tomato looks like we've got some lettuce down over there and more of that parmesan peppercorn action so not a bad ingredients list on this one guys I'm just a little concerned by the size of the chicken tenders though but guys definitely gonna be some flavor with this one for sure I have a feeling with that Parmesan goodness thrown into the mix this is gonna be pretty nice and I love ranch so let's not waste any more time on this one it's the chicken cheddar ranch sandwich here at Arby's let's peep out this flavor the new crispy chicken cheddar ranch alright right off the bat I am so glad this chicken cheddar ranch sandwich has got a diaper around the back guys there is a lot of ranch in the very back of this here right now I didn't realize how much until I picked this one up right now and I can feel it in the very back but guys one quick look again before we get into this a lovely situation with the amount of that peppercorn ranch action guys that parmesan goodness that it's mixed with is gonna be awesome on this I could smell it already and again take another close look at that chicken tender action ready to roll we are definitely gonna get into this right now but first and like always if you guys are fans of high quality

chicken cheddar ranch sandwich part of the two for six over here at Arby's let's do it mmm okay oh yeah that ranch instant pop from that parmesan peppercorn goodness guys that is a lovely situation and I think most of you guys know already ranch is one of my all-time favorite dipping sauces pretty much for Fried Chicken in general pretty much anything actually but this is a lovely situation right there nice flavor on this one and I gotta say the cheddar cheese I am not tasting it all because of how strong that parmesan peppercorn goodness is on this guy's I can't even taste the tomato and that's a good thing right there but as you can see a lovely situation the fried goodness is really standing out on this one and again very very strong in that dressing Department on this guy's it really is pretty good let's go for another bite mmm all right that time I got a little bit of the skin of the tomatoes so no bueno on this guys one of the main reasons I do not like tomato at all the skin around it here I start from just the mushiness of it but man beautiful flavor on this one it's a showcase of that Parmesan peppercorn goodness that ranch is really coming through the tang that it's got as well but that cheddar slice is not really there I'm almost wishing this actually was like the cheddar cheese sauce that would have been amazing with this you know granted I know the creaminess of the ranch is there and obviously the slice of cheese is maybe to kind of keep it together somewhat but considering you've got a sandwich diaper anyway what is the big deal with that I think that would have looked at visually but as it stands I think it's just there for marketing just to have a little bit of a color differentiation between what everything else is on the sandwich you get the nice red pop again from the tomatoes not my favorite but everything else really really is pretty nice on this guys and again the crispness of those tenders your mileage may vary these are actually medium sized for me right now there's one smaller than the other but the quality is pretty decent on it let's go for another bite real quick I'm trying to give you as much detail verbally as I am visually guys and aside from everything that you just heard me talk about right now I'm the nice quality of that bun is pretty awesome it is kind of toasted which is kind of nice and I am digging the fact that it really is holding everything together nicely it's not really falling apart there's pretty fresh but everything else with this is a major showcase for that parmesan peppercorn ranch as it should be again the cheddar very non-existent for me it really should be a cheese sauce but a lovely situation on this and one that I'm probably gonna be getting again oh and hey did I mentioned that ranch is one of my favorite dipping sauces yeah I think I mentioned that earlier in the review it really is guys because of how tangy and rich the flavor is and it really brings anything fried to life I mean it's just a very rich wholesome type of flavor gluttonous still I'm not good for you but every so often it is pretty but again very tasty on this one here and for two for six on its own I think this was like four thirty nine by itself you might as well go for the two for six go for that beef and cheddar gorgeous the standard roast beef whichever you prefer but naturally I think with this one on the menu it's a nice variation in between those two and again if you're a ranch lover like me you have a lot to look forward to with this one we guess that Parmesan cheesiness is kind of there but again I really wish this had the cheddar cheese sauce that would have been a nice little combo with the richness of the ranch in general creamy still but still pretty amazing one more bite we'll finish this one up after the rating and of course I'm gonna give you another close up right now let's do it you know the next time out on this one I'm probably gonna ask for an extra chicken tender because it would really like this one up even further and give you that much more to enjoy because the quality of what's here already already speaks for itself guys adding a little bit of extra protein the fried goodness is gonna go that much further down the line in terms of being amazing for you easy recommendation on this one like I said and for two for six how could you not so after that overall detailed breakdown of this one right now I'm gonna have to give the chicken cheddar ranch sandwich over here at Arby's a pretty rock-solid 8.5 out of 10 the only way that I can see to improve upon this one and I already touched upon it is add an extra chicken tender to that one and maybe make sure they're a little bit more evened out because naturally one of the ones that I had tonight was a little bit smaller than the other but guys don't get me wrong awesome flavor the quality is pretty awesome and like I mentioned earlier and a parmesan peppercorn ranch has got a really nice tangy creamy flavor and I got to say it really likes this one of perfectly and honestly it really is the best choice to have with chicken tenders if you want my opinion how could they not pair it up with that right really delicious stuff and one that like I said I would easily recommend to you man I feel like I'm all over the place right now because the quality was pretty tasty on that and I'm actually doing this right now after hours obviously cheaters cam style because the weather has been extremely hot here in Southern Cali but aside from all that what do you guys personally think of
