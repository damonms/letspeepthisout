 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty good old jack asks the question which came first the chicken or the egg will no need to stress because with their latest promo now they're giving you both at the same time so let's go in on the chicken breakfast jack is part of the two for three here at jack-in-the-box and initially we are greeted with a value size bun guys not too bad though in terms of the size on this one but it does smell buttery believe it or not let's lift this up and see what we got underneath looks like we've got a slice of American cheese a very decently sized egg right there as well and that's sitting on top of a very nicely sized piece of chicken here guys a crispy chicken patty definitely pretty decent value if anything because of the thinness of it but take a look at that guys that is actually not too bad nice and crispy nothing in the bottom very basic ingredients list on this just egg cheese and chicken and I got to say it does look pretty tasty still so let's give this one a shot and see how the flavor is this is the all-new chicken breakfast Jack here at jack-in-the-box part of the 2 for 3 let's peep out this flavor yeah I'm definitely a fan of egg and cheese this actually looks alright guys I have to admit and again the butteriness that I'm smelling from the bun itself is coming across I'm hoping this is gonna be pretty good but like always before I take the first bite you guys are fans of high-quality delicious looking food reviews make sure to hit that subscribe button down below and don't forget to tap the Bell

right off the break I'm definitely diggin the nice crispiness of the chicken patty itself it's actually the dominant flavor that I'm getting here along with the texture of the bun which is nice and soft guys and then the cheese and then the egg comes up on the backend but admittedly the chicken is a little on the thin side you're gonna see that in just a second here but again it's a value sized type of patty overall quality not bad so far let's go for another bite well I'm definitely diggin the egg on this it's got a very yokey type of flavor to it there and it's really coming out nicely with the chicken and speaking of the chicken like I mentioned earlier as you can see in the bottom there it is very very thin so not that in terms of the size in this one because the crispiness is good but it is definitely thin white meat for sure but still two for three bucks is not a bad deal and considering the size of this I really wouldn't go much above a buck fifty for each of these anyways so this is actually priced pretty well and the flavor is decent like I said the crispiness of the chicken is the dominant flavor and overall the nice egg is really shining through as well pretty tasty guys definitely pretty tasty mmm and speaking of that softness of the bun it's actually got a little bit of toastiness to it as well along with just a little bit of butter maybe just a little bit but it's primarily the creaminess of the cheese and then the egg and the chicken but overall guys not bad and the combination that I think works overall and again you can't fade it for three bucks guys two of these for three not a bad deal at all let's go for one more bite and we'll wrap this one up after the rating hang on so a nice little breakfast situation here at jack-in-the-box guys let me go 360 for you here just around this one out not bad in terms of the chicken patty I wish it was just a little bit thicker but considering the price point and for what you're getting here it's not a bad value at all nice and crispy the egg is solid like I mentioned earlier and again the creaminess of that cheese and the softness of the bun overall goes a long way not a bad value whatsoever and I know I'm beating that one to death guys but it really is pretty good and hey you can also get that all day considering jack-in-the-box has been doing breakfast all day literally for years now so overall I'm gonna have to give the chicken breakfast Jack you're pretty solid value over here at jack-in-the-box a rock-solid 8.7 out of 10 it's a couple of points above eight and a half considering the value that you're getting on this one along with the size of the chicken patty itself now granted it's a little on the thinner side but it is pretty wide and the quality feels pretty good when you're holding in your hands guys I have to admit the softness of that bun is pretty awesome now of course the obvious question is do you think this one looks awesome
