 so national cheeseburger day is right around the corner and I'm actually in the mood for a cheeseburger right now well a special type of cheeseburger let's hit that drive thru at cj's to scoop one up welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty yeah peep this out can I go for that guacamole double cheeseburger and that's it beautiful thanks so they've got a holiday for just about everything out there not that you need a special holiday for a cheeseburger I mean every day is cheeseburger day right yeah man how you doing thank you brother stay frosty we'll see ya all right guys let's celebrate national cheeseburger day let's peep this out it's flavor lit by fire here at CJ's as we go in on their guacamole double cheeseburger and for the price point it looks like we've got some value sized goodness to go in on your guys it definitely looks pretty decent for the size of it let's take a look under the hood of the standard hamburger bun here looks like we've got some freshly made guac in house they're kind of known for that they're promoting it pretty heavy right now two slices of pepper jack cheese looks like we've got 100% beef goodness here two patties we've got a tomato slice and we've got some lettuce so no frills but the frills that it does have looks pretty tasty I have to admit definitely the guacamole and the cheese and the beef that's all you really need with something like this let's see if the flavors gonna deliver on it though this is the all-new guacamole double cheeseburger here at Carl's jr. let's peep out this flavor yeah not a bad size for $2.49 and the fact that the guac is made fresh is a huge bonus right there guys and you can really smell it it smells pretty amazing so like always before I take the first bite if you guys

can be notified as soon as new content drops every week here we go it's the guacamole double cheeseburger not that we really need a holiday like I said for cheeseburger day but let's just get into it here we go mmm right off the break I got a mouthful of guacamole and that's not a bad thing because like I said they make this fresh here and you can really taste the quality of that then a little bit of light spicing that I'm getting is adding to it as well just a little bit of sizzle there but the creaminess is on point and then the flame grilled patties are coming in not quite tasting the cheese even though I got a good bite of that as well let's going with it well have no fear if any of you guys were thinking I didn't get a lot of guacamole when I pop the top on this one there is plenty to speak of here just take a look at the very top of the meat it is all throughout here and I have to admit the creaminess is on point the flame-grilled patties are pretty decent again they are value sized not super juicy and the cheese although I can't really taste it too much is adding even more creaminess to that overall experience guys it is pepper jack cheese but there is no spice to speak of but what I am getting is coming from that guacamole it's a lovely situation and like I've said with just about every Carl's jr. review I've done in the past and I've done a lot of them up to this point believe me just take a look at the playlist popping up on your screen right now the flame grilled beef is definitely on point not super juicy but it's very flavorful and of course with the highlight being the guacamole on this one it goes amazingly well with that combination the creaminess the charbroiled flavor and then the cheese even though not quite flavorful on its own is still adding some extra creaminess to the overall party pretty tasty so let's try and go for a little 360 very carefully with this one here as you can see they're not skimping on the amount of cheese guys I just wish the flavor of it was standing out just a little bit more considering it is pepper jack with the flame grilled goodness from the beef is standing out and of course you have a nice amount of guacamole on this one semi softness of the bun itself as well it's just a little on the older side and I have to admit adding the extra crunch with that lettuce and of course the tomato in there you're definitely getting a pretty decent burger and for $2.49 not a bad deal at all so I'm pretty glad I swung by CJ's to finally give this guacamole double cheeseburger a shot and the fact that national cheeseburger day is right around the corner I guess the timing is perfect for it I really enjoyed the overall flavor of this one I just wish the pepper jack cheese itself stood out just a little bit but considering the flavor of that freshly made guacamole and the charbroiled beef I'm not really complaining too much well maybe just a little so with that said I'm gonna have to give the guacamole double cheeseburger a pretty solid value over here at CJ's for $2.49 a pretty decent 8 out of 10 I'm not gonna go much higher than that because like I said it is a value burger the quality was pretty decent and while I wish the patties themselves were just a little bit juicier the flavor overall was pretty good and again I know I'm beating this one to death but $2.49 guys it's a pretty tasty cheeseburger with freshly made guacamole not too bad now the question is are you gonna give this one a shot do me a quick favor and drop some comments down below let me know if you're a fan of guacamole and cheese burgers to begin with and if you are do you like sliced avocado or the pureed guacamole standard like you just saw right now drop those comments down below and definitely let me
