 what's going on everyone and welcome back  to another high quality foodie feature for   you here on the channel where this time  i've returned to wingstop a.k.a thighstop   because a few of you wanted me to check  out their all-new boneless thighs so i   thought i'd do just that with my second  favorite flavor they've got on their menu   so without further ado let's get into it feast  your eyes on their all-new boneless thighs combo   and as always a very lovely situation of fried  goodness guys this is looking pretty fantastic so   starting off on the right side we've got a regular  order of their seasoned fries and as always they   look absolutely fantastic the natural cut variety  so as you can see they've got plenty of potato   skin on the outside of them here guys and they're  definitely seasoned pretty nicely as well too   for dipping of course we've got my old standby  their house made ranch always a banging situation   there but guys feast your eyes on the main  stars of the show the boneless thighs themselves   and honestly these are glorified chicken nuggets  but they're very big featuring coated thigh meat   and i gotta say the bite size action is  looking anything but they're pretty large   and as you can obviously tell by now my second  favorite flavor is their garlic parmesan and believe   me when i tell you they wasted no time in coating  this one very nicely guys there's a liberal amount   of that parmesan goodness all throughout and  i gotta say it's looking pretty dynamite on   these oversized pieces of thigh meat really  really solid and hey you gotta love that outer   crispy coating it's definitely breaded up very  nicely so let's not waste any more time on this   one guys it's the all new boneless thighs here at  wingstop a.k.a thigh stop let's peep out this flavor   yesir it's definitely snowing in july here on  this one guys you can really tell they loaded this   one up with that parmesan goodness on the very  top it's kind of giving me shades of matterhorn   mountain at disneyland actually i'm really digging  the quality of what i'm looking at here right now   and it's hefty i don't even know how many  pieces are in this but this thing has got   some weight guys they definitely spared no  expense in filling this thing up all right   so let's get into this as i'm beginning to  burn up in my car already guys and obviously   very nice pieces of chunky thigh meat in here guys  as you can see a little bit of the regular coating   on the bottom we've got a little bit of that  parmesan action right there just for contrast   not bad in terms of the size on this  so far let's give it a shot it's the   garlic parmesan boneless thighs over  here at wingstop a.k.a thighstop right away that parmesan get you in  the back very tart little tangy man   i am digging the fried outer coating on this this  really doesn't feel like a boneless nugget guys   because this one's a little on the thinner side  but i have to admit the quality is nice definitely   some dark meat action on this and i'm digging  this already let's keep going in pretty good   hmm very good now that i'm looking at this  there actually is a few smaller pieces in   here but even still these are definitely bite  size for sure as you can tell guys but still   same thigh meat action but coated very  nicely let's keep going in pretty nice i love the crunchiness and the  crispiness of it it's really good   and before we get a little further in let me pick  up these fries and give you another shot of these   because i want to give a few of these a go here  before we get into some of the ranch action but   as you can see lovely seasoned goodness guys and  again the natural cut with the skin on them   that's definitely a lovely situation  let's go for a couple of these real fast   i love the fries over wingstop light sweetness  but the crunchiness and the crispiness is there   mmm really good definitely really good and  actually you know what since i'm thinking   about it right now and i've got the ranch here  in front of me let's do that really fast with   a couple of these fries and again that lovely  house-made action nice and thick i know it's kind   of contrasty right now hopefully that's staying in  focus somewhat here for you let's give it a shot man so tangy and rich loveliness loveliness  indeed one more time and we're back to the   boneless thighs but as you can see again i know  it's contrasty but it holds the composure nicely   this fry is definitely soaking up that ranch  and the ranch is sticking very nicely as well love it so good all right so it looks like  i've actually got about three or four of   these big mothers in here take a look at  this guys that is a beautiful situation   of goodness right there it almost feels like  it's a tender actually but this is actually   the thigh meat goodness breaded up and fried to  perfection and then topped off with that garlic   parmesan action here so let's do a little dunk  action we'll try and keep that focus aww yeah   nice and cool on a very hot day loveliness  right there let's give this a shot man yeah juicy and loaded with dark meat  guys take a look at that on the inside   that is just beautifulness right there guys  the coating is actually a little heavy on   this one but even still the juiciness  of the chicken on the inside of it   is great obviously when you've got that garlic  you've got all that parmesan goodness here   a beautiful combination and naturally we're  gonna go for another one aww man no dainty   dipping with this one let's just light this one  up that is banging already let's keep going in   mmm i'm in heaven right now this is insane you  know whether you believe the hype about there   being a chicken wing shortage i'm personally not  feeling that here on the west coast but whatever   excuse is needed to get something like this on  the menu because it's a bigger piece of chicken   i'm all for it guys it is definitely a lovely  situation and again the coating is just amazing   on this guys really really delicious and  i'm really digging the overall tang that   i'm getting from that parmesan the tartness of  it everything in general mixing up with that   ranch because you know we are going for another  swim this is just crazy crazy delicious right now all right so let me just say because i think  most of you know this by now i'm not a super fan   of boneless wings i mean they're glorified nuggets  but guys when you're getting something as glorious   as these when you have these big suckers like  this this really feels like a special occasion   right now so i'm gonna go for one more dip on  this one here because i really want to and let   me just say guys i am glad that i'm giving this  a shot right now these are definitely the way to   have this because they don't feel like they're  boneless nuggets they're big pieces of chicken   thigh breaded up beautifully and i'm just loving  the presentation of this here let's keep going in oh yeah all day long with this the dark meat is  making such a huge difference overall with this   because of the juiciness that it's adding and  when you combine that again with that crispy   outer coating you've got 10 other flavors aside  from garlic parmesan to choose from and obviously   when you combine whatever your flavor of choice  is with the beautifulness that you've got in front   of you here right now you cannot go wrong with  this guys it's a bigger piece of chicken it's   a heartier piece of chicken and it's easily the  way to go if you decide to go this route really   delicious stuff over here at thighstop from  thighstop save a wing at thighstop.com you know i   didn't think i was gonna be back to give this  one a go considering i really am a fan of the   bone-in thighs in general so naturally seeing  glorified nuggets really wasn't doing it for   me but let me just say guys i'm glad that i went  back i'm glad i was able to give this a shot for   those of you who requested it the quality was off  the chart it's a much bigger chicken nugget still   but the juiciness of that dark meat sells this one  completely it's a different tasting type of nugget   and let me just say when you pair that up with  their house made ranch just a banging situation   delicious stuff all around today over here so with  that said i'm going to have to give these all new   boneless thighs here at wingstop a.k.a thighstop  a rock solid 9 out of 10 guys this really is   the ultimate type of chicken nugget if you ask me  i mean dark meat is the way to go and when it's as   plentiful as that is in the box i gotta say very  lovely situation right there my only gripe though   is that there is a few pieces actually that really  don't constitute being quote unquote thighs even   though the meat may be there they're not nearly  as big but even still the boxes filled out pretty   nicely there's three or four big chunks in there  and let me just say again it goes beautiful with   the ranch sauce just delicious stuff all around  highly recommended all right so i've got one   simple question for you are you team bone-in or  team boneless drop those comments down below and   definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K  closing out another high quality foodie feature   for you here on peep this
