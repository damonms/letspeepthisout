like we've got some smash sauce we have some haystack onions some grilled onions some smoked Hickory bacon the applewood variety already know what's going on with that one there and if you guys can

if I can split this and go a little deeper Wow guys the smell is glorious the look is glorious this is looking fantastic and the fact that it's got a fried egg on it that's buried in there I'm super excited to get into this right now so let's not waste any more time and do just that there is a lot going on with this one it's the sin city burger the double Sin City burger from smash burger let's

glorious looking I mean look at this already this is gonna be pretty insane it's the double Sin City Burger returning here to smash burger my first time giving it a shot let's do it man heavenly already we're going in right here oh my god oh my god oh my god so many crispy haystack onions and the grilled onions already setting the tone with this one with the applewood smoked bacon the fried egg the beef the cheese all in one shot I don't even know about the smash sauce because I'm getting so much flavor from everything else guys it's glorious let's keep going in and we're definitely going in for that close-up you're gonna want to see this ooo very sexy right now mmm-mmm criminally sinfully delicious guys the 100% Angus beef already is jumping off this bun ridiculously in the flavor Department look at everything else on here it's a nice thin fried egg on the very top of it plenty of cheese separating and plenty of the onions the grilled onions that haystack crispy onion goodness smash sauce I'm not really tasting but guys everything else the meat the cheese the bacon the egg this is absolutely glorious on top of the soft bun that it's on let's keep going with this and how could I not given everything this thing has I mean I'm a super fan of fried eggs in general but I have to admit this has kind of taken me back to the farmhouse King from BK because I really love the flavor of a fried egg cheese and beef and that burger was pretty amazing take a look at my review of that from back in the day if you haven't already but guys the smash burger way of doing things over here is easily a step up in the flavor Department the way they season the beef the way they smash it down the way they caramelize around the edges this thing is just the glorious beast and I'm going in again here we go mmm man and let me just say I am so glad I got the double right now because aside from being really really hungry at the moment you actually need a little bit more meat to compliment the amount of toppings that are on this I think that as a single the meat believe it or not would be kind of hanging back in the background with all the other flavor coming from the onions the cheese and of course the crispy onions on top of it let's not forget about the Alpha wood smoked bacon this is just a flavor explosion truly sinful truly criminally delicious and guys worthy of the name this is very very awesome it really is and that fried egg on top of it you pull just a little piece of that off here just you guys can kind of see it just a little bit it's decent a little on the thin side but it definitely adds a nice flavor overall let's keep going one more time we give you that final close-up mmm man all right let's do a little 360 action because this burger is not gonna last guys I am definitely polishing this off look at how amazingly glorious this looks especially from the backside over there definitely an amazing situation with the beef the cheese the onions hanging off the crispy onions the grilled onions the bacon everything about this screams flavor and the name is absolutely worthy of it guys a sin city burger unlike any other and the first time for me having I'm definitely gonna be getting this again get it in the double trust me you really need double meat on this one guys it is highly worth your time and bring plenty of napkins because you're gonna need it guys it's definitely a very wet burger there's a lot happening there and you're going to make sure you're adequately prepared so guys overall I'm gonna have to give the double Sin City burger here at smash burger the obvious come on you know it's coming right 10 out of 10 absolutely nothing wrong with that it's meat it's cheese it's plenty of grilled onions crispy onions the bacon on top of it the softness of the bun and just an overabundance of flavor the meat is insane and the double version of it is absolutely off the chart I can't speak more highly about it super sexy highly worth your time but of course the question is is this one worth your time drop some comments down below do you guys have a smash burger in your area and are you a fan of the burgers
