 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty things are getting meatier and cheesier over at Carl's jr. as the big Carl gets a pretty tasty looking upgrade and that upgrade is in exactly where it needs to be guys the meat and the cheese feast your eyes and not just the big Carl the really big Carl and I gotta say it looks like the name guys it is really really big looking really nice with all that 100% beef peeking out the middle right there let's pop the top of the sesame seed bun very carefully actually it looks like we have got some of that Thousand Island type sauce on the inside we've got American cheese and three patties are actually here in effect let's see if I can split this down the middle for you we'll get some of that cheese pull action very lovely situation guys the smell is glorious in my car right now and with this amount of beef you can bet it is gonna be pretty amazing I think in the flavor Department it's looking really really nice nice and cheesy nice and beefy underneath that we've got some pretty fresh looking lettuce it looks really really nice nice and green and on the very bottom of this one more of that sauce so lovely situation this is a total meat and cheese fest of epic proportions here guys it looks really really awesome let's see if the flavor's gonna deliver on it how could it not right this is the really big Carl here at Carl's jr. let's peep out this flavor you know when I went to check out that beyond barbecue cheeseburger at Carl's jr. recently which you should see popping up on your screen right now you can definitely check that one out it was very fun to do I actually saw this one up on the menu board and I said to myself you know what I'm probably gonna be swinging back to do this because it looked pretty amazing and I gotta say after picking it up for the review right now it really does look pretty amazing live guys there's a lot of beef on this one right now and it is very very hefty so before I take the first bite which I'm very anxious to do as always if you guys are fans of high-quality delicious looking food reviews because this looks pretty delicious and you're gonna see it up close in

big Carl it's living up to its name here we go mmm sorry to talk with my mouth full with that one but I just could not help it right away there is so much beef so much cheese and it's really really flavorful let's go for another bite I'm definitely getting you in here for this close-up guys you got to see this it's pretty awesome mmm man well let me just say the first two words that really stick in my mind right after these first couple of bites are easily stupidly delicious guys it's a meat and cheese showcase and while it's a little on the drier side there is so much cheesy flavor on this one to really make up for that that you can really taste everything beautifully it's more of an evolutionary step up from the regular big Carl so I know that ones considered I guess a Big Mac clone but it doesn't have that middle bun but again we are missing the pickles we're missing the onions so this is really just more of the Thousand Island type sauce and lettuce a plenty of meat and cheese and again that's the real showcase for this one and I'm perfectly okay with that yeah it's pretty tasty and I have to admit as I was biting into it also I love the way the bun kind of melds around the meat itself and you can feel how much meat you are biting into it with this one and then you get the nice cheese flavor and of course that Thousand Island dressing there's just so much of everything on this burger right now it's just crazy delicious scratch that stupid delicious let's go for another bite mmm man three bites in and I already feel like I'm kind of good right now guys I am not kidding with you there is just a lot of meat on this one it looks great on the poster and I have to admit again the flavor is just delivering its all the charbroiled flavor that Carl's jr. is known for really up in your face cleanly with the flavor of the cheese on top of it is really really awesome let me go for one more bite and I think I'm definitely gonna be good after that we'll go for that final close-up and then we'll finish this one out it's just it's tasty I think you know that by now right here we go again mmm all right I'm gonna take you 360 with this one as carefully as I can because there is so much dressing around the back here as you can see this bun is kind of falling apart it is crazy right now I think I'm about to lose very bottom of it but guys I'm doing my best for you as you can see so much meat so much cheese just insane amount of beef and guys again the flavor is stupid delicious on this I can't stop saying it because it is amazing look at all this beef they're really big Carl is gargantuan this thing is really worth money it really is yeah this is a lot of fun to check out and what made it even better for me was that I was really in the mood for a really tasty really thick and hearty burger and that one easily fit the bill guys I mean how could not with three patties three pieces of cheese and just overall just the size being what it was really awesome stuff so with that said I'm gonna have to give the really big Carl over here at Carl's jr. a rock-solid 9 out of 10 the only way I can see to really enhance that would be to really add some pickles and some onions for a little bit of variety a little bit of extra crunch but as it stands again a meat and cheese showcase unlike any other right now and definitely something very hearty to check out over here at Carl's jr. highly recommended now of course the obvious question is are you gonna take me up on that recommendation drop some comments down below have you already had the Big Carl over here at Carl's jr. and if you have do you think it actually tasted like a Big Mac drop those comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K closing out another
