 what's going on everyone and welcome  back to another high quality foodie   feature for you here on the channel  where this time i'm over at bk to put   together a little halloween fun on an item  that's only officially available in canada   that's right you already know it's the  franken whopper so stay tuned because   i'm bringing it to life up next welcome to  peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty so here it is the monstrosity known as the  franken whopper just in time for halloween here   at bk and what looks to be a very fun mashup  of their flagship burger ak the whopper and   a couple of their regular sides that you would  probably get with one of their combos anyway   but naturally when you combine both of them on  the inside of the whopper itself that's where   it's going to get the height from it's looking  pretty cool all right so as mentioned what this   is is their classic whopper featuring that sesame  seeded bun and on the inside we've got ketchup   mayo lettuce tomato onion and pickle and you're  gonna see in the very middle guys separated in   between the tomato slices is a layer of  french fries and onion rings and that's   all on top of a quarter pound of flame grilled  beef and i gotta say guys it looks pretty cool   presentation wise although i gotta admit i really  wish this actually had a green bun to go with   and hey it's something for halloween right outside  of the ghost pepper nuggets this is definitely a   very cool little mash up here but again i really  wish this was looking a little bit more the part   in terms of the color but even still i think what  we've got here is going to be pretty tasty so   there you go it's the just in time for halloween  franken whopper available officially in canada but   unofficially everywhere else because it's pretty  easy to put together here at bk let's peep out   this flavor well i guess you can say this is the  lazy way to eat one of the combos over here at bk   because naturally you'd want to take a bite of the  burger a little bit of your sides and then there   you go but if you want to just go for everything  all at one time now you can unofficially this   is available year round naturally but like i said  they really needed to have the green bun to match   good old frank with this i really think that would  have been so much better but like i said it's late   to the game it's just in time for halloween and  hey it's something and again the size is pretty   cool on this i have to admit all right so let's go  in on this and naturally with me not being a fan   of tomatoes i really wanted to kind of simulate  exactly how this is made in terms of the picture   the way that it looks here but let's just give it  a go it's the franken whopper from bk let's do it man well that's exactly as i expected it to  be it's the classic whopper with a lot of french   fries and a lot of their onion rings all the  classic flavors of bk together in one bite and   i got pretty much everything in one bite there  with the exception of the pickles they're pretty much   come up next i think but as you can see guys  it adds a lot of girth to it a lot of height   and obviously it's trying to simulate good  old frank stitched together with various   different things but like i said guys it's all  the flavors of bk definitely a gluttonous burger   but a very lazy way again to have one  of the combos here at bk let's go for   another couple of bites on this this  is just a fun burger let's just do it well i guess we got the green for the pickles so  that counts for something but as you can see again   guys a lot of the goodness on the inside that you  already know a lot of the fun flavors and again   having something themed for the halloween holiday  is definitely a bonus but like i said a very late   to the party throw together for bk for this one  and probably something you guys have probably done   unofficially for years i mean having two different  sides on a burger i've never done like this   but at the same time it's nice to have  the option even if it's unofficially that   can be made it's still pretty cool to have it  officially up in canada for you guys very nice   yeah this definitely needs the nightmare king  bun from a couple of years ago to really set this   one off it would have been absolutely perfect  with this particular one and honestly i almost   got cheese on this to send me a little bit of the  orange because i'm actually still holding out for   an orange bun maybe hopefully next year for like  a pumpkin thing or something like that for color   i think it would have been really cool but  guys very fun at the same time and again   something to celebrate the holiday with  unofficially for bk definitely digging the   way the logo looks and hey on top of all that  it does have the flame grilled beefy flavor   on top of everything else here so you know i  kind of wish i got the cheese but then again i   wanted to simulate exactly how this one looked and  separating it between the tomato slices naturally   very tasty at the same time but i think you know  what's up at this point right all right so let's   go for one more bite of this monstrosity the  franken whopper here at bk unofficially here   in southern california and then we'll wrap this  review up coming up next here hang on one second well this thing absolutely gets destroyed the  further you get into it here so depending upon   how you put your stuff together you're going to  notice guys it is very very messy but at the same   time as we go around the world it is absolutely  something fun to try i only wish it was in a   little bit of a better clothing situation as in  a green bun but at the same time this is very   fun to check out happy halloween to all you guys  pretty nice all right so considering that i put   this one together since it's not officially  available here in the states i'm not going   to give this one a rating but would i actually  get this one again down the road probably not   i got to be honest guys this was simply fun to  check out because naturally i was curious to see   the combination of french fries as well as onion  rings on top of a whopper how that would actually   be but like i said the appearance is really  what they needed for halloween with this one   outside of the whole stitching everything together  the way good old frank is i like the idea of it at   the same time i think it just needed a little bit  of a better rollout marketing wise to really push   it but even still very fun to check out all right  so for all you peeps up in canada right now do me   a quick favor drop some comments down below let  me know how you enjoyed the official version of   the franken whopper up your way and i'm actually  very curious to see what the wrapper looked like   if it came in a separate wrapper i'm very curious  to see if they had something halloween themed   do me a quick favor and let me know on social  media all my handles are at the very end naturally   and also throughout this review i'm always a fan  of the marketing when it comes to these things   so drop those comments down below and definitely  let me know as well and with that this is Ian K   closing out another high quality foodie feature  for you here on peep this out reviews bringing
