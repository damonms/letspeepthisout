 you already know what it is it's Ian K back at it this time over at Sonic for a little tots and nachos action so stay tuned because the totchos are up next welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty so it looks like we have the appropriately named totchos here at Sonic and I got to admit this actually looks and smells pretty great guys what we've got here is a nice little portion of their famous tater tots coated in cheddar cheese we've got some bacon bits diced onions jalapeno and a baja sauce and I got to admit like I said it really looks and smells pretty great I guess the only thing really missing from this to really take it into that nacho category for real is some diced tomatoes and maybe some sour cream but guys this really looks pretty solid and a decent amount of cheese all around looks like a little bit of shredded cheese in there as well let's give this one a shot and see how the flavor is gonna deliver cuz like I said it looks and smells pretty great it's a small order of the totchos here at sonic let's peep out this flavor yeah this is definitely a hefty little portion for $2.99 I'm really diggin the overall presentation just the weight of what I've got here this is actually looking pretty good so let me see if I can confirm that goodness for you I mean on the real how bad could this really be right I mean it's fried tater tots with a cheddar cheese sauce and a bunch of other fun toppings to go with so before I get into this and like always if you guys are fans of high quality delicious looking food reviews make sure to hit that subscribe button down below you don't forget to tap the Bell icon so you could be notified as soon as brand new content drops every week guys the totchos kind of a fun name let me see if I can get a little bit of everything here some of that bacon goodness some of the grilled onions or the chopped onions I should say they're not grilled let's give this a go this is actually looking good let me give you a little quick shot of that before I jump in lovely situation here guys a little bit of everything here we go it's the totchos here at Sonic of course yummy mmm that heat from that jalapeno right away oh my god and you guys are gonna kill me right now because I don't have a drink again mmm it's that pickled type of jalapeno flavor but guys the seeds are on this you can actually see the seeds in this here and the heat is absolutely there mmm the bacon and the jalapeno and the cheese right away and I think a little bit of that Baja sauce is coming through as well guys again a nice combination of goodness here this is really really cool I got to admit and like I said the heftiness is there and thankfully I'm looking at this a little closer and they actually have toppings all throughout so it's not just on the top but the tots themselves nice and crispy a lovely situation there for sure and nice and golden but the fried goodness the cheese that goes with this is pretty nice let me go for a little bit more of the onion you know what let me grab another one of these here oh you know what let's just do it right now the totchos was is this round 2 or 3 I think it's 3 here we go mmm that technically was around 3 because it was a total of 3 tots that I've had so far mmm that is really good now I'm getting that baha sauce a little bit more it's creamy but the cheese the bacon yeah this is really really tasty and like I said the portion is pretty nice on this as you guys can see here lots of toppings they definitely didn't skimp on what I've got here maybe a few more jalapenos would have been more appreciated but other than that I really think this just needs a little bit of sour cream to kind of even out the load on the heat because the jalapenos are pretty strong on this it really is pretty good all right let me grab one more of these jalapenos and another one of these tots a little bit of the bacon if I can get this little piece in here all right there we go one more let's close up here as you guys can see a nice crispy situation on that bacon I'm definitely diggin the overall quality of the crunch that I'm getting from everything together of course the tots are nice and crispy and the diced onions adding even more crunch to that along with the heat from the jalapeno is a nice touch shredded cheese again just a nice combination I only wish there was just a little bit of sour cream on this that would have been really really great but guys still decent for $2.99 totchos it's like I'm saying nacho but I'm not but what else can I say except I'm really glad I finally gave this one a shot and like I mentioned earlier how bad could this really be I mean we're starting off with crispy tater tots and a creamy cheese sauce that's already a win right there top it off with some bacon and of course the onions and naturally those jalapenos which added a nice bit of heat and guys let's not forget about that baja sauce nice combination and like I said for $2.99 pretty bangin value so with that said I'm gonna have to give this tots and nachos hybrid the totchos here at Sonic a pretty decent 8.5 out of 10 the only way this could have been improved and you've heard me mention it a couple of times throughout this review is a little bit of sour cream in my opinion that would have been just a beautiful accent just in terms of the presentation if not flavor but guys as it stands this is an easy recommendation they should really keep this on the menu it's pretty great but of course the obvious question is that this is pretty great to you do me a quick favor drop some comments down below first things first let me know if you thought the selection of toppings really replicated what you think nachos should personally have and secondly are you personally gonna give this one a shot drop some comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K closing out another episode of peep this out bringing you brand new content
