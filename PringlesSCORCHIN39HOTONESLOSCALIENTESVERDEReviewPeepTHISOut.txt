 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty what's going on everyone and welcome back  to the channel it's Ian K where today i'm   actually in between projects but after a quick  little jump on over to cvs to pick something up   something actually caught my eye guys  and i'm so glad to finally be doing this   feast your eyes on the pringles scorchin  hot ones i'm actually gonna be doing the los   calientes verde version and i gotta say this is  looking really nice basically what this is is a   can full of pringle goodness that consists of  a smoky blend of serrano and habanero chilis   sweet fruit and tart tomatillo so i'm guessing  there's going to be a fair amount of heat with   this guys and i'm very excited to give this one a  go and considering it's well over 90 plus degrees   right now in southern cali of course i had to  do this outside right so without further ado   here we go we're going to pop and see if we can't  stop with these right now very excited to give   this a shot i've got some water on the side just  to be on the safe side here and let's give this a   quick go and just looking at this wow i'm already  smelling some definite salsa action but this as   you guys can see it looks like it's dusted with  some green goodness here oh yeah that is really   really really strong actually take a quick look  at that nice texture on this outside as well   definitely dusted green with the good stuff here  let's give this a shot guys i'm very curious here   the hot ones the official collabo with pringles  scorchin no less this is definitely going to   be pretty fun i think the los calientes verde  version let's give this a shot let's peep this out salty oh oh yeah that's got some heat hang on mmm salty but the peppers are coming  through wow that is beginning to pick up   that's lovely that is definitely awesome for  the namesake on something like this i gotta say   very tasty and i'm totally digging  the can on this as well look at that   very very tasty on this one first we feast  presents the hot ones let's keep going in oh man that's pretty awesome i mean it's a  mainstream ship naturally so it's not super   super hot but it's definitely elevated  guys totally digging the can on this one   very very cool with the marketing and as you  can see the official goodness right over there   definitely worthy of having a flame on this chip  this is pretty crazy right now really cool and i   like the fact that you've actually got a dare to  scan code on this which is kind of cool because   obviously with the whole last dab thing once  they finish the reviews it's always kind of cool   actually when you see the celebrities i'm  beginning to lose my voice here slightly   when the celebrities are trying to get through  a session eating wings and with all the sauces   as well too that way it's kind of cool because the  last dab you gotta do that but naturally with this   the cool thing about this wow that's really  beginning to kick up here hang on one second i'm like all over the place with  this okay so by scanning the code   you have a chance to win basically a dabified  version of pringles which is basically probably   just a heavy version of the sauces on  here with an official can i would think   um which is kind of cool but i am totally digging  this guys very very nice apparently there are two   other versions you can get one over at walmart  i believe it's the los caliente rojo version   and then the classic hot sauce which is actually  at circle k so if i happen to find any of those   i'll see about doing official reviews  either here officially on structured content   or on live stream that we usually do but wow  i am really really digging these right now my   mind is all over the place because of that heat  in the very middle this is actually pretty nice it's totally worthy of the scorchin name and  i'm so glad i'm doing this outside right now too   a lot of fun on this one and i keep  showing the can because i love the   marketing on that it looks really cool  that's the official goodness right there   with everything that you're seeing here  naturally and artificially flavored   a very authentic spicy type of green  salsa effect with this and of course   you're getting the usual saltiness of the chip  itself for the pringles very very nice on this it's getting a little bit more tolerable as i  go but the back of my throat is pretty lit up   right now but it's nice guys it's elevated  and it's worthy of the scorchin name so   definitely digging this absolutely  very tasty let's go for one more   and then we'll wrap the review up with the  rating coming up next these are pretty good a little over two bucks for the can  not bad classic pringles you know   usual price point limited time only very very  slick on this one really really nice okay   let me get one more swig here hang on man i'm so glad i have some type of water at  least i probably should have milk right now but   still it's very hot outside i don't want to drink  milk on a hot day even though it's probably going   to be a little warm it's fine water is good for  what this is right now overall let's just wrap   this up because i feel my throat beginning to go  i'm gonna have to give the pringles scorchin hot   ones the los calientes verde a pretty solid  9 out of 10 guys that really is up with   the namesake in terms of what you're getting  there you're getting the scorchin brand name   as well as the uh the actual sauce which is really  good as well too that way so the hot ones name is   warranted the scorchin name is warranted and  overall the quality is pretty awesome on that   i have to say i am totally digging what this is  i'm definitely gonna have to see if i can find   the other two like i said i'll see about doing  a couple of regular reviews structured like this   or on live stream depending there but if I'm  able to find them i'll definitely give that a shot   it's really doing a number in my throat right now  but it's pretty awesome so guys real quick before   i wrap this review up drop some comments down  below let me know if you've actually tried any   of these currently right now and if you've tried  all three which do you recommend out of the three   because so far this one is pretty elevated so  i can only imagine the classic hot sauce or the   rojo version of it as well i may have to swing  on over to walmart to see about that one but   very very banging on that one drop those comments  down below let me know which one you recommend   and with that this is Ian K closing out another  high quality foodie feature for you here on   peep this out reviews bringing you brand new  content every single week here on my channel
