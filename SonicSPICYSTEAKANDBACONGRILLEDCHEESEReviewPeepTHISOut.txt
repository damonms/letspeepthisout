 welcome to peep this out reviews  with Ian K stay frosty hey everyone welcome to the channel where today  I'm over at Sonic America's drive-in because   it looks like they've got a combination of  tastiness that looks great on the ad but I   have to admit I'm just a little worried about  this one that's right and you're about to get   a deep dive into this one Feast your eyes on  what I've got here it's the spicy steak and   bacon grilled cheese and I have to admit guys it  looks a little different compared to the picture   and as you can see there is lots of goodness  it looks like in the middle there although   it's kind of sloppy but at the same time the  presentation is a little bit lackluster as far   as I'm concerned let's break this one on down for  you real fast and of course we'll go in further   well I gotta say right off the break the Texas  toast is looking really nice I mean they do kind   of specialize in that over here at Sonic they've  had a few sandwiches in the past that use it and   obviously it looks pretty decent the thickness  is good but let's pop this one and take a look   underneath and as you're gonna see it looks like  we're supposed to have a little bit of a cheese   sauce as well as some mayo it looks like maybe  just a little bit of mayo right there and some   jalapenos but as we pan down you're gonna see  some more sliced jalapenos hence the spicy in   the title for this one guys but underneath that  it looks like we have a fairly decent amount of   bacon although it's kind of clumped up and as you  can see there it's supposed to have a little bit   more cheese action I'm not really feeling the  grilled cheese with this but hey it is what it   is we've got some grilled onions an okay amount  there but guys the interesting thing is the steak   itself at first I thought this was a hamburger but  obviously as we look underneath over here it looks   like it's a piece of grilled steak that's folded  over I think it should have been chopped up just   a little bit here but guys it looks semi-burnt  so I'm not really digging that because the edges   look kind of black and underneath it it looks like  we're supposed to have some more cheese there but   it looks very very light overall I'm not really  feeling like this is a grilled cheese but guys   very different on this one on but hey it is what  it is so while I definitely dig the ingredients   list on this one the presentation leaves a lot to  be desired and hopefully we're going to have some   decent flavor with this one guys because I just  don't know but there you go this is the all-new   spicy steak and bacon grilled cheese here at Sonic  let's peep out this flavor oh Sonic Sonic Sonic what am   I going to do with you here this doesn't look  anything like the picture and guys just take   a look at that folded steak action right there  I just don't know about this one I'm gonna try   and keep an open mind as usual but again it's Hit  or Miss whenever I review over here at Sonic and   so far this is already feeling like a miss to be  honest but let's just give it a go here we go it's   the spicy steak and bacon grilled cheese quote  unquote over here at Sonic let's peep this out man come on   you know first off this has the potential to be  so much juicier than it really is guys I mean when   you have grilled onions with moisture you have all  the cheese the cheese sauce I'm supposed to have   you think this would be really flavorful right  it isn't guys take a look at how dry the steak is   this is ridiculous this is only minutes old and I  gotta say this is very disappointing and not only   is the presentation lackluster the flavor is off  the chart in terms of lacklusterness as well I   am very much hurt by this right now because  the only thing I'm really getting is decent   Texas toast and sliced jalapenos that's it let's  keep going in guys honestly boo boo it really is at least the Bacon's coming  through right there man this is whack   well I guess Sonic didn't think I deserved  some cheese sauce with this one guys because   there apparently is none on here it's literally  just some of the cheese on the very bottom and   that's it but wow what a presentation on this  one very very weak in that department and the   only thing kind of saving this one is really  just a sliced jalapeno flavor and the bacon   guys there's really nothing else here to speak of  and I have to admit the toughness of that steak in   the bottom is not winning this one any favors I am  highly disappointed with this experience right now   you know I think most of you guys know by now  that whenever I give a review I try and go in   with a very open mind because naturally guys it's  hard to mess something up unless of course it's   just not made correctly and of course it's  going to be scored accordingly but chances   are it's going to be a protein a carb a sauce  the combination is usually going to work so   how bad could it really be right but when you  have something like this I have to admit the   presentation speaks nothing about what I'm having  here right now let alone the fact that I have no   cheese sauce on this and it doesn't feel like  a grilled cheese sandwich so I love the toasty   aspect of the Texas toast but everything else  on this is just screaming thrown together so   very disappointing on this and honestly while I  usually go two more bites in with this one I'm   only gonna go for one because guys there's really  nothing else of value with this unfortunately it   is what it is I'm just going to keep showing it  to you as much as I can here but again what's   really saving this is the sliced jalapenos  and the bacon the toughness of that steak in   the bottom it should be chopped up it should  be a lot juicier there should be some cheese   sauce on it you should feel more like a grilled  cheese sandwich but guys unfortunately it's a   whack experience today and it has to be graded  accordingly so let's let's go for one more bite   we'll wrap the review with the rating coming  up next it is what it is what are you gonna do well let's just go around the world with this  one and I have a feeling some of you guys are   going to have a better experience with this than  compared to what I'm having here right now but   hey it is what it is I gotta rate him as I get  them overall I do like the Texas toast the bacon   flavor is decent and of course the jalapenos  but of course the well-rounded picture on this   one is just not evident unfortunately and with  that folded over piece of steak like I said I   thought it was burger at first this is really  not doing anything to win me over and again   another lackluster experience unfortunately here  at Sonic it is what it is what are you gonna do but what I'm going to do is give it the rating  that I think it deserves based upon my experience   today so overall I'm gonna have to give this all  new Spicy steak and bacon grilled cheese sandwich   here at Sonic the obvious 3 out of 10 and at  least it's obvious for me because guys the only   reason I'm giving it three points is because 1  I like the Texas toast 2 the bacon was decent   and 3 of course the jalapenos really lit that  one up everything else no bueno guys I'm missing a   lot of the options I think I should have gotten  on that sandwich and naturally the presentation   looks nothing like the picture unfortunately and  guys keep in mind there is another version of this   with barbecue sauce which I'm sure would be good  as well but I don't think I even want to check   that one out based upon this experience right now  definitely no bueno but of course that's usually   what happens when I review here at Sonic it's  a 50 50 chance of something not being right and   unfortunately today is one of those days where  it isn't right oh well alright do me a quick   favor like always drop those comments down below  what did you personally think of this particular   one today I mean if you've had it actually as  well did you actually have it made correctly   for you possibly was there more cheese on it was  there more grilled onions did you actually have a   better piece of steak was it chopped up drop those  comments down below and definitely let me know   and with that this is Ian K closing out  another high
