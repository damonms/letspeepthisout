 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty what's going on everyone it's Ian K back again  with another high quality foodie feature for you   here on peep this out reviews back on over  at papa john's to take a look at an annual   tradition that i'm finally reviewing here on  the channel for the first time guys feast your   eyes on the jack-o-lantern thin crust pizza and  with halloween being like the greatest holiday   ever i'm really surprised i waited this long to do  this but hey better late than never so what we've   got here is a very fun shaped jack-o-lantern  shaped pepperoni pizza thin crust and i gotta   say it's looking really really fun a very decent  amount of pepperoni going all the way around this   and as you can see it's baked up very very nicely  some of the pepperonis are kind of curling up just   a bit it's thin crust it's keeping the  composure and you're probably noticing   it's uncut and we'll talk a little bit  about that as we get further into the review   but i'm really digging the fun characteristics  of a jack-o'-lantern we've got the eyes with   two little olives for the pupils we've got the  mouth obviously with that little smiley action   right there and a very cool stump on the very  top there so very very slick let's not waste   any more time on this one guys let's get right on  into it it's the returning jack-o-lantern thin crust   pizza here at papa john's let's peep out this  flavor yesir this looks like a very cool fun   halloween novelty that papa john's pretty much  does every year and i'm glad that i'm finally   doing this here on the channel for the first time  guys it looks really really cool so before i get   into this and like always if you guys are fans  of high quality delicious looking food reviews   make sure to hit that subscribe button down below  and don't forget to tap that bell icon so you can   be notified as soon as brand new content drops  every week all right this is uncut so i actually   have a plastic knife over here let me cut a piece  really quick we'll give you a look at how this is   for some of you guys out there you probably  know this already some of you pizza aficionados   whenever you get a pizza uncut it actually  prevents the box from getting all greasy on   the bottom so if you can whenever you order a  pizza ask them to uncut it because if you've   got a pizza cutter at home it'll definitely be a  little less greasy for you so here we go let me   pull up one of these pieces here and i decided to  go with the stump take a look at that guys i kind   of made almost a perfect slice there a little bit  of the pepperoni action but i'm really digging the   overall bake on the very top there that looks like  an authentic stump of a pumpkin on the top there   look at the coloring on that that's pretty  cool so nice and thin as you can see looking   really good it's definitely thin and crispy  really digging that very super thin actually   i think it's one of my first times i've had like  an ultra thin crust pizza here at papa john's so   let's give this a shot the jack-o-lantern thin  crust pizza here at papa john's let's do it tasty fun oh yeah that actually is very tasty i  like rocking thin crust pizza once in a while i   mean it's less carby because there's not a lot of  bread here obviously and as you can see the crust   is made very nicely it's very crispy very crunchy  and i'm really digging this right over here i   think this is going to be the piece that you want  to start with because you've got like a little   holder in the very back but again i am really  digging the stump that this has here from good old   jack this is just really really cool nice cheese  on this as well there's a decent amount on here   the pepperoni i haven't really gotten into because  i'm actually not at the top yet but overall very   familiar papa john's flavor the sauce is pretty  good just a fun pizza guys let's go in again yeah this is going to be kind of a quick  review guys i mean it's just a thin crust   pepperoni pizza but it's the novelty of what it  is and i got to admit the main characteristic   that i like on top of the eyes and the mouth  naturally is the stump because look at that   the crust is really really cool and that's kind of  authentic looking right there in the very top so   one more bite on this one we'll finish this  one out very fast like i said a nice fun   novelty pizza but guys very cool with the  crust on this one and i'm really digging   the fact that the composure of everything is  held together nicely here because it's thin   and it's uncut so the bottom of this box is not  greasy at all well maybe now it kind of is because   i cut into this already but still very very cool  one more bite we'll finish this one out all right   so let me put this one back together again for  you and as you can see it looks like we've got   a heart-shaped hole in his forehead right there  guys it's because he loves you after all i mean   take a look at him guys jack is definitely down  for the holiday he really is made for halloween   and i got to admit just a very fun novelty pizza  that i'm so glad to finally do here on the channel   and highly worth your time i mean 11 bucks for  a thin crust may be a little up there for what   this is but the size is decent and the flavor is  solid and obviously that shape is pretty iconic   over here at papa john's i'm really really digging  the overall look of this one lots of fun carving   the perfect jack-o'-lantern is hard eating the  perfect jack-o-lantern that's easy yeah definitely   a fun novelty pizza perfect for the holiday i mean  halloween is like the ultimate right so with that   said i'm gonna have to give the returning  jack-o'-lantern thin crust pizza my first   time giving it a shot over here at papa john's a  rock-solid 9 out of 10 it pretty much delivered   exactly what i was expecting but starting off  with the iconic look that's the very striking   thing about it it looks the part and obviously i  really love the fact that the shape came out as   well as it did especially after it was done baking  it was really cool coming off that conveyor seeing   how it looked right there but i have to admit  the characteristics are on point you definitely   have those olives for the eyes and naturally the  stump believe it or not is my favorite part of it   because of how authentic that really looked with  the toastiness and the color just a fun pizza guys   i mean it really is okay now the obvious question  for you guys who have had this in the past are   you excited that this one's back on the menu for  the holiday i mean you probably expected it right   drop some comments down below let me know if  you've given this one a shot and if you have   is this something that you get annually drop those  comments down below and definitely let me know and   with that this is ian K closing out another
