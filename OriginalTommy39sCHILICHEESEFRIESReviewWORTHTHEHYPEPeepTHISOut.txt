 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty hey everyone welcome back to another high quality  foodie feature for you here on the channel well   you asked and i'm about to deliver i'm back  on over at the original tommy's to indulge   in some pretty awesome looking chili cheese  fries and guys i can't wait to get into it   and i'm actually gonna have to do this very  carefully so guys feast your eyes on the chili   cheese fries from tommy's this is looking pretty  insane and actually i don't even know how many   fries are on the underneath of this helping  of chili here but it's looking pretty insane   what you're looking at here is a portion of  their crispy fries dumped on with a whole   bunch of their world famous chili and of course  we've got some cheese to go with there guys   and i gotta admit very hefty in the hand here  right now so i definitely want to do this outside   right now it's a beautiful day here in southern  cali right now considering it's winter but let's   just give this a go guys very heavy wow the  meat on this is already insane it's going to be   a whole jumbled mess of goodness i'm just going  to pick up you know what here we go right there   look at that action right there guys i'll try and  keep that as focused as i can but look at that   crazy here we go the chili cheese fries  here at the original tommy's let's do it banging whoa first off again please accept  my humble apologies for waiting so long to   come over to tommy's considering how local it  is to me but guys the chili is ultra rich i'm   actually getting a vibe from the hat believe  it or not which is another local favorite here   but the richness of this is a little smoother  a little creamier lots of beefy flavor i'm not   really tasting any potatoes this is essentially  just a vehicle to get all of this fried   actually i should say chili goodness into my face  here right now the french fries are fine they're   nice and crispy they're holding their own but  guys it's all about the chili action with this   let's just keep going in i'm blown away  as i'm talking right now this is delicious mmm man it gets you right there light spicing  but beefy a little bit of refried bean action   that i'm kind of tasting like a smooth bean  flavor but it's beefy guys really beefy and   the cheese i can actually taste it pretty  creamy pretty rich it feels like maybe a   slice of processed american cheese they put  right in the middle and that's pretty much   what gives you all the melty goodness but man  i am thoroughly enjoying the goodness that this   has to offer here right now delicious stuff  at the original tommy's let's keep going in oh yeah banging all day all day long i  got to try some other things on the menu   this is crazy and as i'm beginning to kind of  separate this a bit guys take a look at all   the cheese in the middle of that they actually  layer it nicely my guess is it's the fries they   ladle a whole bunch of chili put the cheese in  the middle more chili on top call it a day well   worth the $5.05 right now  for this because you can really taste the quality   and again i'm just gonna keep lifting it up here  the quality of that chili is so delicious on this   crazy delicious and actually it's even fun doing  it outside like this as well so good time so far yeah so there's really not too much else i  could really say about this and considering   how awesome the double chili cheeseburger was that  i reviewed last week which you guys are probably   seeing popping up on your screen here right now  this is a nice addition to go with that burger   and considering how much chili was on that i'm not  surprised that there's so much on these fries here   right now guys they're really showcasing what  they're known for the original tommy's world   famous chili that's what it is so let me go for  a little bit more we'll call it a day on this one   because i definitely want to go in more on this  off camera but again a lovely situation of fried   goodness the chili cheese fries are just banging  over here guys and again they're really holding   the crispiness of those fries considering how much  chili is on this that's really an amazing thing   go for a little action here lift this up again  for you but guys super crazy delicious and i'm   so glad you've given this one a shot and again  i'm so sorry i waited this long to do it let's   do one more bite we'll close this one out  after the rating but delicious stuff guys oh yeah yes absolutely delicious stuff so overall  i'm gonna have to give the chili cheese fries here   at the original tommy's a rock solid 10 out of 10  guys definitely a beautifully beefy situation with   the chili itself and that is the main highlight  i can see why so many people love it over here   and it's so delicious just the right amount of  saltiness it's not ultra greasy even though the   burger had a lot of grease to it even though  that's what made the charm of it i thought   but with this a lot of chili and a decent amount  of cheese that i can taste that you can see   and overall the crispiness of those fries really  held their own so an easy recommendation and guys   like i said for five bucks that's not bad you're  getting a nice little hefty train of goodness here   and i'm only saying that because maybe i should  buy a few more of these and link them together   guys because they are definitely a beautiful  situation they just present beautifully in the   box and i have to say they fill the box that's the  most beautiful thing about it on top of the taste   of it beautiful stuff all right so I'm willing to bet  that if you've made it this far into the review   you're either (A) a fan of chili fries already or  (B) maybe a fan of the original tommy's in general   whatever the case is drop some comments down below  and let me know what you thought of these fries   here and if you've never been to tommy's is this  a spot that you think you want to try sometime   in the future drop some comments down below and  definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K   closing out another high quality foodie feature  for you
