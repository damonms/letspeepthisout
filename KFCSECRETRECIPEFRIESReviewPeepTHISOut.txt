go with the KFC secret recipe fries and guys are definitely a cool presentation I'm absolutely loving the container these come in here and now very very cool as you guys can see a very healthy portion of fried goodness here guys these look nice and crispy supposedly seasoned with a secret recipe which I'm assuming is the Colonel's famous 11 herbs and spices but take a look at that nice and crispy it definitely looks pretty nice a nice change over from the regular potato wedges actually and I can't wait to give these a shot for dipping I decided to go with the obvious the finger licking good sauce I thought I'd try something a little different with this one today but I got to admit I am loving the presentation of these it looked heavily seasoned they smell heavily seasoned in the car and definitely I can't wait to give these a shot right now guys it's the all-new secret recipe fries here at KFC let's peep out this flavor yeah these definitely smell heavenly seasoned and I don't know if it's just where I'm having these right now but I'm getting a sense of like chicken in the air for some reason I don't know what it is what could it possibly be maybe it's the Colonel's staring at me from the very back of the package here guys these do look pretty great alright so before I hopefully confirm the greatness of these fries for you right now and like always if you guys are fans of

guys the secret recipe fries here at KFC look at that nice and crispy I am really diggin how this looks right now let's give this a shot crunchy salty a little bit of butteriness to it believe it or not guys I don't know if it's just a fry the oil that is really really nice try and focus that in for you right there it's probably not gonna work too well but there's a lot of potato on the inside of this right now salty though so far guys very salty let's keep going yeah they're good though they're really good actually after that second bite I'm kind of getting like a chicken broth type of vibe and again I don't know if it's because the colonel is staring at me right now but this definitely feels like it's got something a little extra on it besides its salt it's not so much battered as they are nicely fried but there's a creaminess to the potato on the inside and I'm really taking the overall flavor of these they're pretty good mmm man really nice I'm getting like a chicken broth type of situation with this guys take a look at this right here it's nice and crispy nice and brown and I am really digging the saltiness it's a little elevated but I like that actually nice and crunchy nice and crispy too all right so let me put these down real fast we'll go for a little bit of that finger-licking good sauce here a little bit of something besides the ranch that I always get and I don't really get this too often so I'm really hoping this is gonna be good Wow there is some nice seasoning on this guy's take a look on the inside there that is not bad at all can you grab one of these fries and we'll go for a little dip action right here it's almost like a Thousand Island type of situation here with some spices of its own these don't normally come with anything on the side I guess to dip into you have to ask for it there you can also get these fries as part of their regular combos as well too let's give it a shot mmm oh yeah oh yeah easily enhanced with this sauce here guys mmm oh man I'm almost getting like a thousand island with a little bit of ketchup thrown into the mix I don't really have the finger-licking sauce too often but the crispiness and the crunchiness of this goes amazingly well let's go for another dip action for you guys here as you guys can see it's like a standard type of fry but it has something extra on it it's not battered but it definitely feels like it is got something going on with it here guys really nice with the flavor again I don't know about the 11 herbs and spices I'm assuming it but at the same time the saltiness is there the crispiness is there if you're a fan of fries you already know these are gonna be bomb for you pretty good mmm man that is really nice and just to kind of get that in the middle right over there hopefully that focus is gonna kind of hold just a little bit you can kind of see the creaminess the softness of that potato in the middle but I love the coating on this guy's the coating is just really really nice as you guys can see there but when you add it with this finger licking good sauce right now this is the jam this really is and I'm so glad that I got it with this this really makes the difference for me easy recommendation to give these a shot guys you have a lot to look forward to these are pretty great okay so again I'm not really sure about the secret recipe on that I love the marketing angle of it there of course with the 11 herbs and spices for the colonel but I'm not really getting anything above and beyond a little bit of an extra type of flavor with the salt included there it definitely feels like a heavily salted fry but not an average tasting fry it's definitely high-quality the creaminess of that potato on the inside and the overall texture is a beautiful situation pair that up with the finger-licking good sauce guys it's totally finger looking good off the chart with that a nice combination and that's really a testament to the saltiness of the fry mixing with the ingredients of that sauce so an easy recommendation and something I think you should really try and honestly I definitely think you're going to so with that said I'm gonna have to give the secret recipe fries over here at KFC are pretty rock solid 9 out of 10 the only reason it's not a super 10 out of 10 is because the saltiness is elevated on these guys you're gonna notice it right away at least from my experience right now but it's very tasty and the quality is definitely there so give this one a shot and like I said I know you're going to but of course you can always prove me wrong right now by dropping some comments down below and letting me know if you are gonna give these a shot or if you aren't I can't see how you're not going to if you guys are fans of KFC these look like they're gonna be on the menu for a while if not permanently so I would easily recommend giving these ago and like I said I know you're gonna so drop those comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K closing out another episode of peep this out bringing you brand new content every single week here on my channel so while you stay tuned for that
