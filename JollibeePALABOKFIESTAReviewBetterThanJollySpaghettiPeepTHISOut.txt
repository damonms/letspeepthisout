 hey everyone welcome or welcome back to the  channel it's Ian K cheaters cam style after   hours back on over at jollibee this time to  check out the other noodle themed dish they've   got going on the menu and considering the name  of what this one is i have a feeling i'm in for   a flavor party with it that's right so stay  tuned because the palabok fiesta is up next   welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty all right you ready let's peep this out guys  feast your eyes on the palabok fiesta here at   jollibee and what looks to be a very nice colorful  noodle dish and i have to say the presentation is   looking really good especially with those eggs  right there definitely digging what i've got in   front of me here right now so this is being billed  as a traditional filipino noodle dish covered in   a garlic sauce along with sauteed pork shrimp  and egg and guys there's a very nice amount of   that sauteed pork on the very top of this and  the garnishment of all the other goodies there   looks a little light but at the same time the  combination is looking pretty inviting not bad   for $6.49 and like i said this is a little  hefty situation in my hands here right now   and also i'm digging what looks like bits of  parsley on the very top of this one to give it   even more color variation with everything  i've got going here right now but guys   a very nice combination of goodness so  let me mix this up just a bit a little bit   looks like it's like a vermicelli type of noodle  like glass noodles they're very thin but i have   to say i am digging the way that these are cooked  right now al dente for sure you can kind of see   they're soft but they have a little bit of pull to  them which i'm really digging let me see if i can   get just a little bit of the sauteed pork and that  sauce the garlic sauce together there we go just a   little bit here we go one more time before we give  you a first bite into this one here right now it's   the palabok fiesta i hope i'm not butchering  that name over here at jollibee let's do it oh that's rich it's a rich sauce and again glass  noodles they kind of slip and slide as you're   chewing them down but a very nice combination  of goodies here guys take a look at that again   this is actually really nice it's not  traditional spaghetti it's not like   chow mein noodles they're really very  thin i want to say like kind of like rice   noodles but glass noodles for sure almost  translucent looking let's keep going in that's not bad not bad at all light saltiness of  the sauteed pork the garlic that i'm getting with   this one here is not so much the sauce it's  really more coming from i think the pork i   mean it's flavorful at the same time but let me  see if i can go for a little bit of that sauce   along with a little bit of the shrimp  action here there's only about three or four   shrimp on the inside and i've got one of them  right there on the very top kind of blending in   with everything here but i'm really liking the  flavor of this one it's definitely better than   their jolly spaghetti that i did not that long ago  which you've probably seen that review jumping up   on your screen here right now that was just okay  for what it was this is i think the signature dish   on their menu and rightfully so with all  these ingredients here let's keep going in yeah the shrimp is good we need more of them  though they're a little on the tiny side   take a look at that like popcorn shrimp almost  here like three or four of these that's it but   for a fast food dish i get it at the same time  i think bigger shrimp would have gone a long way   it's good though really good yeah i'm  absolutely digging this one over the   jolly spaghetti guys i mean there's just more  going on with this one and there's more flavor   profiles to really kind of go in on and you can  really taste everything beautifully on this one   that minced pork is definitely a lovely  situation as you can see the sauteed goodness   along with the shrimp and the egg that we're  gonna get into definitely a nice presentation   and the flavor is absolutely delivering on this  one so far and being that i'm a huge fan of egg   when it comes to just about anything that i eat  especially with chinese food i mean when you get   fried rice it needs to have shredded egg all  throughout that's just the best as far as i'm   concerned but the fact that we've got a couple  of slices of hard boiled egg on this one very   very nice as you can see the quality is nice and  again i love the little parsley action that it's   got on the very top with this one let's go with  a little bit of everything here including the egg oh yeah that hard-boiled yolk the creaminess of  it that is really nice it goes amazingly well   and guys just so you know this whole thing it's  about 410 calories roughly that's actually not bad   considering what i've got here right now it's  a very very hearty dish that i'm getting into   and i'm really digging the quality of this but  speaking of quality and this is something that   i was like okay when i opened up the bag what is  this we've actually got some lemon juice here so   i'm very curious to see how this is gonna go with  some lemon juice let me carefully open this up all right hopefully that  went all right there we go   all right so i'm just gonna kind of put this all  around i'm definitely down with lemon in general   this is definitely gonna be nice wow that's pretty  aromatic i can smell this already wow that is very   strong very very strong okay let's mix this up  just a little bit all right and i'm gonna try and   do this as neatly as i can for you guys a little  bit of everything here minus the egg but naturally   a little shrimp action it looks like here we go  really liking this this is actually really good mmm oh yeah oh wow the tartness of that  lemon along with the garlic sauteed pork and   everything the sauce with this that is really  nice and again the lovely glass noodle action   with this as it tries to focus in guys look  at that that is really really good this is   pretty awesome i would say going with this  one over the jolly spaghetti any day of the   week this has just got more going along with  it there i'm absolutely digging this so let's   go for another couple of bites on this i am  really enjoying it and i'm enjoying it even   more because i'm doing it for the first time on  camera with you guys here so let's keep going in you need that lemon juice that is really good  really good wow it's making my mouth water super   tart i really like that very concentrated  on this crazy never heard of this brand but   i am really digging that house recipe maybe that's  the reason why look at that really really strong   on this and i'm absolutely digging this very very  nice quality all right so let's go for one more   bite with this one here we'll twirl a little bit  more of this i think it's one of the first times   i'm having probably a noodle dish at night with  you guys like this on camera which is kind of fun   but there we go very lovely situation on this here  this tries to stay focused there we go all right   let's go for one more bite and then we'll wrap the  review up with the rating coming up next but guys   another fun one over here at jollibee scratching  this one off the list of their menu that they've   got over here something you definitely want  to check out if you're down with spaghetti   in general especially for fast food spaghetti  pretty decent amount of the goodness and again   the sauteed pork the garlic very nice combination  one more bite we'll close it out hang on yes sir this is the signature noodle dish  on their menu over here at jollibee for sure   i mean they're building this as a traditional  filipino noodle dish so you guys already know   for those of you who are familiar with this  one this is a very very solid one across the   board i'm definitely digging the sauteed  pork and the combination of shrimp and egg   i just wish we had just a little bit more of  it at the same time you can actually add more   shrimp for an upcharge but at the same time what  you're getting here are popcorn shrimp it needs   to be just a little bit bigger but the combination  on top of those glass-like noodles really goes a   long way a very nice combination of goodness  over here with the palabok fiesta jollibee   yup that's definitely a flavor party for sure  guys i'm not sure what palabok translates into so   if you guys possibly know if you're watching this  overseas drop some comments down below and let me   know what that actually means but fiesta for sure  that is definitely a party in my mouth for sure in   terms of flavor and i'm absolutely digging the  overall quality and just the overall mouth feel   of everything that i got into with that very nice  experience with this one all right so with that   said i'm going to have to give the palabak fiesta  and again i hope i'm not butchering that name too   much over here at jollibee a very rock solid 9  out of 10 guys a very awesome flavor profile with   this one and easily the better of the two as far  as i'm concerned compared to the jolly spaghetti   this is definitely the one to go with everything  is heightened across the board with that lemon   juice and the combination of the egg and the  shrimp definitely definitely definitely an   awesome thing to go in on for sure i just wish they  were just a little bit larger across the board   and again even though you can up charge to get  that shrimp i would recommend the shrimp being   just a little bit bigger i mean you can do that  jollibee come on still a very nice experience   and definitely a blast to check out here after  hours here on peep this out reviews all right so   question time for all of you jolly heads out there  drop some comments down below let me know what you
