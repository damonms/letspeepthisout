 welcome to peep this out reviews  with Ian K stay frosty hey everyone welcome to the channel where  today I'm over at Papa John's to check out   another one of their all-new side items they've  got on the menu for a limited time only and   for today's review it looks like I'm going in on  a bite-sized version of a true Italian classic   well that's the idea anyway so guys Feast your  eyes on what I've got here here we go with the   chicken parmesan Papa bites and I have to say the  presentation is looking pretty nice on these guys   they definitely look like they're packed with  protein let's break these on down for you real   fast yes sir it looks like we've got some nice  packed puffed pockets of doughy goodness with this   one guys and I gotta say again the presentation's  looking pretty nice so basically what we've got   here are eight bites of Papa John's original  pizza dough that's rolled up very nicely with   chicken and parmesan cheese and not only do they  look pretty solid they smell pretty solid as   well for dipping off to the side of course and to  complete the chicken parmesan look with this one   we've got a side of pizza sauce AKA marinara and  of course we're gonna get into that but guys very   simple on this one it's pretty much just pizza  dough chicken and Parmesan and I gotta say I'm   really looking forward to getting into these so  let's not waste any more time let's do just that   these are the all new chicken parmesan Papa bites  here at Papa John's let's peep out this flavor   well like I usually say with some of the things I  review here on the channel Simplicity is sometimes   the best way to go especially when there's  only three main ingredients I mean pizza   dough chicken and cheese and well I guess the  pizza sauce if you count four but still let's   give this one a go let me pick one of these up  and yes sir nice and puffy guys and actually I   don't remember really parmesan being that gooey  like this this kind of looks like kind of the   standard mozzarella but I'm down with that  if it is but it looks pretty nice it looks   like we have a decent amount of chicken on  the inside of this one and of course with   the puffiness of the dough let's go for a  single bite solo dolo first and of course   we're gonna get into some tomato sauce aka the  pizza sauce for dipping let's peep this out hearty little suckers mmm well I don't know  about parmesan but I'm definitely getting   mozzarella with that and that's actually  not bad and of course on the inside of   that with only one piece of chicken because  I guess it was one of the end pieces but the   doughiness is definitely on point it's very  satisfying to dive into nice and soft and I   have to admit very very tasty along with that  mozzarella cheese let me just kill this we'll   get into another one and of course we're  gonna go into some dipping sauce hang on   these are tasty I mean you can't really fade  the pizza dough especially when it's as fresh   as these are and guys right out of the oven  These are nice and warm in my hand here right   now so very tasty on this let's go for another  bite but first let's lace it up with the good   stuff right there very nice little dunking  in there as well too lovely situation let's   give this a shot the true chicken parmesan Papa  bite now over here at Papa John's let's do it mmm come on it's tasty nice sweetness elevated  from the marinara sauce the nice denseness from   the pizza dough that's rolled in along with a nice  little bite that I'm getting from the chicken and   of course the cheese with that it would have been  nice if these were kind of fried Believe It or   Not that'd be kind of cool as well but naturally  the baked goodness is a beautiful situation with   this when you think of like true chicken parm you  think of like a pan-fried filet so it's obviously   not that but with the Main Ingredients being the  Papa John's goodness over here this is very very   hearty so very very nice let's go for another  bite on this one I think we'll kill this whole   thing right now because this is pretty delicious  guys very tasty and not bad for promo pricing at   least for the first week at $4.99 not bad mmm  all right so let's go for one more of these   here and again pretty nice guys I mean they're  a little bit different in terms of each of the   ones that you'll get in here for the eight pieces  some are going to have a little bit more of the   ingredients than others and generally they're  pretty solid so this one looks like it's fairly   wrapped up nicely with some chicken right there  let's go for another couple of bites on these   we keep that Focus very nice I mean how bad  could this really be when it's freshly made   like this you've got the chicken the cheese and  again the parmesan I think is maybe a little bit   more lightly there in the background this is  more the mozzarella showcase that I'm getting   with this and I'm cool with that because it's  delicious let's go for another couple on this mmm tasty and again it's pretty much just like a bite-sized  version of that classic Italian favorite minus   the fried fillet for the Patty naturally but  I have to say very very tasty either way so   let's go for one more bite on this we'll wrap  the review with the rating coming up next but   a very nice side item especially worth it I  gotta say for $4.99 for the first week this   is pretty tasty like this and very hearty to get  into one more bite we'll close it out hang on well I gotta say this is a pretty tasty side item  to get with any of the regular menu items here at   Papa John's guys I mean it satisfies for what it  is it's rolled pizza dough with some melted cheese   as well as some chicken and the quality is pretty  decent and when you pair it up with the marinara   sauce not bad whatsoever but again I think the  best time to get this is this first week because   of the promo pricing at $4.99 for eight pieces not  bad for that I gotta say and again very tasty for   what it is so with that said I'm gonna have to  give the chicken parmesan Papa bites here at   Papa John's a pretty solid 8.5 out of 10 guys like I said three main ingredients it's   simple that's all you really need with this one  especially to go with the marinara dipping sauce   the pizza sauce goes beautifully with it and when  you factor in the melted cheesy goodness with that   along with the chicken and depending upon the  bite that you get you may actually get a little   bit more chicken than usual it's a very nice  combination and again like I said it's a hearty   little snack and I think something that would go  pretty well with just about any of the items that   we heard Papa John's hence the way it's designed  but still guys pretty tasty for what it is and it   was absolutely fun to check out today all right  so do me a quick favor like always drop those   comments down below if you've had true chicken  parm in the past which I'd venture to guess most   of you guys pretty much have what did you think  of this overall representation of quote unquote   chicken parmesan when it comes to these Papa  bites over here at Papa John's they look pretty   appetizing to you drop those comments down below  and definitely let me know and with that this is   Ian K closing out
