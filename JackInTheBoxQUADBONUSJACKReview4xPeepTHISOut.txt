 all right it is definitely turning in a jack-in-the-box week here on the channel right now as I'm back over here at Jack once again to take a look at a brand new burger that could very well be four times the fun you guys ready for the quad bonus Jack stay tuned because it's up next welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty so here we go with the quad bonus Jack here at jack-in-the-box and don't let the size fool you this is definitely a smaller size burger but there is plenty of meat and cheese and while the patties themselves are value size with lots of cheese around them they are definitely a thin thin thin let's take a look at the bun here looks like it is that soft action as always underneath it we've got that secret sauce we've got some shredded lettuce some pickles and then here comes the meat and cheese guys and as you can see by the thinness definitely value size goodness there we've got one we've got two we've got three right there and then there is the fourth one on the bottom and lots of gooey American cheese to go with here guys so a meat and cheese showcase absolutely with this one here and the value is pretty high even though they're thin patties there's a lot of stack to this one and I'm really diggin how that looks actually $5.99 combo comes with a drink and some curly fries I'm gonna be focusing on the burger only because that is the star of the show but guys here we go it's the quad Bonus Jack here at jack-in-the-box let's get about this flavor and hey just in case you haven't noticed of course I'm doing this one cheaters cam style after hours of course because if you're going out on a burger of this magnitude with four patties let's just say I really don't want a lot of people checking me out during the day while I dive in on this so let's just get right to it but before I do that unlike always if you guys are fans of high quality delicious looking food reviews make sure to hit that subscribe button down below and don't forget to tap the Bell icon so you could be notified as soon as brand new content drops every week guys the quad bonus Jack this looks really really meaty up close I got to say let's give it a shot here at jack-in-the-box after-hours mm-hmm it's a lot of meat and cheese yeah those patties are definitely value size but there is a thickness to this one that really makes up for that guys the fact that this four of them stacked really adds to the overall weight this one big time four slices of cheese and a very very sweet sauce on this one I don't know if I'm really digging that too much but guys it is very meaty very cheesy let's keep going I'll give me that close-up not bad you know I gotta say the thinness of the patties on this one actually remind me of in and out just a bit just minus the caramelized edges and actually the flavor is gonna be different the sauce is different but this really does have the feel of a double-double believe it or not with a couple of extra pieces of meat almost like the 4x4 but naturally the flavor is definitely different sweetness of that sauce is just a little up there for me but guys it is meat and cheese and lots of tastiness to go with it's really really tasty for that reason and by tastiness to go with what I mean is that there is plenty of beef plenty of cheese so while the value sized patties are definitely stacked up nicely on this one the fact that they're thin is not really deterring from the fact that it is just very very tasty and the fact that you're getting a thick amount of meat on this I want to say it's maybe much closer to like a half pound of beef not really quite up there but it really does feel substantial even though it's a smaller bun so value size appearance but it packs a wallop in terms of meat and cheese that extra patty I think does make a difference over the triple and guys I think it's pretty evident you're gonna like this if you're a carnivore if you're a meat-eater this is definitely gonna be right up your alley for $5.99 with a drink and fries it's not bad at all it really isn't so let me go for one more bite of this value size beastly burger before we wrap this one up and give it a rating so let's go a little 360 action on this one to show you what I'm looking at from the back here guys a very decent amount of cheese like I said even though the value size patties are in effect with this one here nice snap from the pickles if I gotta say I wish I had just a few more of those on here with four patties I think you need at least four or five pickles to really match it but the sauce itself is just a little elevated in the sweetness category so I'm not really a super fan of that but it is slightly drowned out as you're eating this I all the meat and the cheese and as you can see there is no shortage of that if you decide to go with the quad not bad at all you know as I'm thinking about this throughout this review I believe the Bonus Jack actually had that middle bun very reminiscent of the Big Mac back in the day that I actually reviewed I believe two years ago this month so if you guys haven't seen that review take a look at that one popping up on your screen right now that was a pretty decent value proposition back then as well I believe with fries and a drink and that's definitely something to consider especially if four patties is not really your thing but I guess it doesn't really matter because even with three patties you're not getting the middle bun at all with this one so it still has the bonus Jack name but it doesn't really look like the Big Mac but as this one stands I don't think it's going for that at all it's going from meat and cheese and it definitely wins in that category so with that said I'm gonna have to give the quad bonus Jack here at jack-in-the-box a pretty solid 9 out of 10 what really carry this one naturally is all the beef and the cheese on this one and it really does kind of drown out the sweetness that's elevated from the sauce itself a little bit of extra pickles would have gone the long way but naturally having that softness of the bun the lettuce it pretty much rounds out nicely still a very tasty burger guys value patty size or not it is still thick and that is pretty awesome now the question is that this look pretty awesome to you drop some comments down below are you looking forward to giving the triple version of this one a shot and better yet what about the quad version is that one on your radar drop those comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K closing out
