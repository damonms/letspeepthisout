 what's going on everyone and welcome to the  channel it's Ian K where today i'm over at   bk to check out the mystery that is the all-new  what the fanta frozen drink and don't let this   color fool you guys because this flavor could  be anything so stay tuned because it's up next   welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty well let me start this one off by saying this one  has already got a very familiar aroma guys i hope   it's going to be what i'm thinking right now but  feast your eyes on it here we go with the what   the fanta frozen drink here at bk and as you can  see this is looking very surge like in the color   definitely a lovely situation here very simply  what we've got is a cup of blended ice along   with a mystery fanta flavor and in this case  a green color to kind of throw you off just   a bit but guys it's looking very frosty very  refreshing and i gotta say i'm very curious to   see if my expectation is gonna be satisfied  with what i'm smelling here right now let's   give this a shot guys here we go it's the what the  fanta frozen drink here at bk let's peep this out ooo wow hang on one second that's different i thought it was going  to be like a watermelon thing at first but well it's throwing me for a loop i want to  say kind of cotton candy-ish believe it or not   that is kind of crazy right  now let's keep going in wow it's super refreshing you know it's got little  hints of watermelon little hints of strawberry but   the combination is very fruity on this one it  almost tastes like a cotton candy mix but guys   again i love the whole frostiness of this cup and  i have to say again the green color is throwing me   off just a bit it almost kind of reminds me of a  surge look believe it or not and honestly that's   kind of really what it looks like to me it's like  a surge drink but on frozen form but the flavor   is pretty trippy on this mmm i like that i like  the whole idea of this kind of playing with my   head because of the color and actually there's  going to be about four different versions of a   regular drink coming out i believe it's blue green  orange and peach believe it or not that actually   have all different flavors but they're different  color to throw you off so i like the idea of this   one being green i thought it was going to be  like a lime situation but honestly that would   be kind of too simple right but at the same time  maybe mountain dew who knows but this is really   tasting more like cotton candy-ish a watermelon  strawberry type of fruity mix almost like a pina   colada i mean it's all over the place a little bit  but i keep dovetailing back into the cotton candy   mode with this this really does kind of taste like  a state fair type of situation honestly hang on that is so banging i like the idea of this one  really throwing me off because of that color   and honestly guys if you're down with checking  out the other versions eventually when they come   out in stores make sure you're using the  hashtag what the fanta in social media to   kind of get involved with the whole situation  with this but this i gotta say the bk version i   would love to see the other versions over here  hopefully this will be successful enough where   they'll have the different flavors the different  colors that would be kind of cool but this one is   really kind of blowing me away with the idea that  it's more like a cotton candy type of situation   but it's funny because as i'm talking and it's  more kind of like sitting it's like resonating   with me i'm getting little hints of watermelon  still so i mean cotton candy is like a mixture   of a lot of fruity types of things it's very light  but the sweetness on this believe it or not is not   too bad but the frostiness is definitely off  the chart let's go for another couple on this wow i really like this this is really really  tasty and the presentation again very nice i   mean it's just a cup of blended ice but guys  a lovely situation of goodness here i believe   this is about a 16 ounce cup very very nice  indeed for the quality of this pretty banging i really like that very very good okay rounding  this one out just with a quickie look at this one   because guys again very excited to check out this  flavor very very lime like in presentation but   again the colors are designed to throw you off so  what you're gonna get is not necessarily obviously   what it is and that's the whole what the fanta  thing they're just trying to guess what it is   very cool overall we have to give that one a solid  8 out of 10 i think the what the fanta promo   is pretty cool with this one i think it's fun for  summer it's going to blow you away because the   color is not going to be what you think it is and  then naturally the flavors are going to be off the   chart i'm very curious to try the other versions  of this and again bk if you're watching this you   really need to jump in and maybe get the other  flavors on your menu over here naturally i'd love   to try a frozen version of those other colors  i think they would just look kind of cool so   very tasty on this one very tasty indeed all right  so do me a quick favor drop some comments down   below let me know if you're going to be giving  this one a shot over here at bk and if you're   going to be trying the regular drink versions of  these that should be showing up in stores very   soon which ones are you most excited to try i mean  color wise out of the blue green orange and peach   naturally with this one being the green frosted  one over here definitely a bomb situation but   drop those comments down below let me know what  your thoughts are as well as what you're going   to be trying i'm very curious to hear what you  have to say on this one so let me know down below   and with that this is Ian K closing out another  high quality foodie feature for you here on peep   this out reviews bringing you brand
