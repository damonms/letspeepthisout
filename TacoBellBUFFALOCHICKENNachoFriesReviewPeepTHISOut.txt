 hey everyone I'm back at it this time over at Taco Bell because not only are the nacho fries back on the menu but now they've got a buffalo chicken variant to go in on so stay tuned because it's up next welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty so here we go with the buffalo chicken nacho fries and what stands out to me already with this one besides that reduced fat sour cream is the drizzling of that buffalo sauce all on top of these nacho fries guys this actually looks really really good and you can really smell that buffalo sauce pretty nicely but we've got here is a nice platter of those nacho fries featuring the bold Mexican spices all the usual goodness that these fries are known for definitely a fan favorite topped off with a little bit of shredded chicken we've got a three cheese nacho blend of course that buffalo sauce some shredded cheese and reduced fat sour cream along with the pico de gallo goodness there as well and I'm saying goodness because there's not a lot of it there so it's there for accent and it definitely adds to the overall presentation so definitely diggin the presentation of this one overall I think it looks really really good for $3.49 a little bit more expensive in my area this is looking to smell and taste hopefully as good as it looks let's see if it does just that it's the buffalo chicken nacho fries here at Taco Bell let's peep out this flavor so did you know this is actually the very first time a Taco Bell is offering buffalo sauce that in and of itself is a reason to get excited about this one guys because out of all the same ingredients that they make all of their food with for so many years now it's the first time there's something truly new on the menu so let me grab a little bit of this here guys this is actually looking nice we'll go a little bit of a sour cream there is plenty of buffalo sauce as I'm actually lifting this up already and you know what let's do a little Pico let's live dangerously here here we go it's the buffalo chicken nacho fries the returning nacho fries for like the 15 millionth time year at Taco Bell let's do it oh the Buffalo is nice oh yeah alright first off let me just say the buffalo sauce like usually with this right now is instantly reminding me of the version over at BK it's got the same amount of thickness and the flavor is very similar with that back end burn that comes up very lightly it's nothing crazy it's just enough to let you know that it's there but the buffalo flavor is very rich and very ranch like and I'm diggin that because like I said it's similar to BK but the quality of it is definitely nice and hey it's actually helped along with all of the cheese that's on this right now this is actually a very nice platter guys and I have to admit at first I thought it was gonna be a little on the small side but it is packed very nicely and the fact that you're getting the three cheese blend with the shredded cheddar cheese the chicken itself I'm not really tasting too much yet let me see if I can actually grab just a little bit of it here we go let's give this a shot and see how it is with the chicken a little bit more not bad alright I'm gonna try and keep my fork as steady as possible but if you take a look in the very front of my fork there you're gonna see a nice chunk of chicken guys I actually don't have any shredded chicken on this it's more chunked out it's part of the reason I thought I didn't have any chicken on this when they popped the top on this one but guys it's very flavorful it's juicy and it really goes amazingly well with that buffalo sauce it's a lovely situation with the cheese too and overall with the sour cream very nice flavor man I had a hard time balancing that last shot because of how heavy this piece of chicken is guys I was really surprised I've got a lot of nice pieces here and this is actually a very very cool thing because I think the larger pieces of chicken goes so nicely with all those toppings the shredded stuff I think would kind of get lost in the mix but this is actually pretty nice guys I don't want to wait anymore let's just keep going with it yeah that's definitely nice and well absolutely unexpected I'm so glad that I got a version like this right now considering the price I paid a little bit more expensive than the normal $2.99 that I thought it was gonna be but the fact that it's chunkier chicken this is the only way that I think I'm gonna get this if I decide to go back and get this again scratch that when I go back to get this again all the flavors work very well in the chunkier chicken like I said really brings out the overall flavor of that creamier buffalo sauce and all the other ingredients on this let me go for one more bite of this one we'll wrap this one up with the rating and then overall wrap up the review mmm so one more quickie shot just around this one out here and as you can see nice chunks of chicken on this one guys and I do believe it makes the difference with this overall I think my rating is gonna be a little bit higher because of that reason and I love the overall flavor of that buffalo sauce like I said it's very reminiscent to BK to me it's very ranch like it's very thick and the right amount of sizzle to go with it there just a nice job all around with this one so with all that said I'm with a rating based strictly on my experience today I'm gonna have to give the buffalo chicken nacho fries here at Taco Bell a rock-solid 9 out of 10 the only way that I can see about improving this one is strictly making the platter a little bit bigger even at $3.49 the elevated price point here on the west coast that definitely fits the bill because of the chunkier chicken that I got but I would love to see just a larger platter of it because guys we all love nacho fries why don't they put them in bigger containers charge a little bit extra if you have to but definitely let's get that platter a little bit bigger overall the quality delivers on this one if you love buffalo sauce you're gonna like this a lot it's really good and now for the obvious question even though I think and though the answer to this one are you gonna be giving this one a shot drop some comments down below after you do give it a shot what did you personally think of the flavor of that buffalo sauce did it remind you of BK because it easily did for me drop those comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K closing out another episode of peep this out bringing you brand new content every single week
