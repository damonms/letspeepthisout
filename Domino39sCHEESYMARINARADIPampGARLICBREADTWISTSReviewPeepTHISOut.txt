 hey everyone welcome back to another high quality  foodie feature for you here 0n the channel where   this time i'm headed into domino's to check out  another one of their all-new oven baked dips   that's right and you already know what it is  it's their cheesy marinara dip with garlic   twist so stay tuned because it's up next welcome  to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty so here we go with round two the cheesy marinara  dip and garlic bread twists and already the   presentation of those garlic bread twists is  looking pretty nice guys really nice and puffy   looking and i gotta say the garlic aroma in the  car is beginning to kick and to go along with   it and the main reason why we're checking this  out guys feast your eyes on the cheesy marinara   dip itself a lovely situation of melted cheesy  goodness guys this is looking pretty awesome   underneath all that cheese is actually marinara  sauce and it really looks like it's got more   cheese than anything else but i'm not complaining  because this is definitely looking and smelling   fantastic looks like it's just as oily as expected  because of all that melted cheese but i'm not   necessarily complaining just yet guys because the  aroma is definitely lighting up my car just like   those garlic bread twists so let's not waste any  more time on this one we're getting into it this   is the all new cheesy marinara dip and garlic  bread twists here at domino's let's peep out   this flavor yes sir and again we've got another  heated tin of deliciousness here guys just take a   look at all that cheesy goodness just glistening  in the sun and you can see the oil glistening   along with it very loveliness and i gotta say  my hand is somewhat healed up after checking   out the five cheese dip that i just did recently  which you're probably seeing that jump on your   screen here right now that was a lovely situation  with those parmesan twists so of course naturally   i had to go in with the garlic because i think  that it would just go so much better along with   the cheese and the marinara sauce just to kind  of give a little bit of variance and flavor but   let me just grab one of these really quick before  we get into the actual dip so you guys can take a   look as it glistens in and focuses hopefully there  we go take a look at that action guys the garlic   is strong on this and as you can see we've got  some olive oil goodness here as well let me go   for a quick bite of this first and then we'll  get into some of the dip can't wait let's do it wow wow man heavy garlic very nice and i think  i'll let the piece that just fell into the tin   here kind of marinate just a little bit with  everything else but guys very lovely situation   on this and as you can see hopefully that's going  to focus in take a look at that light and airy but   dense at the same time with a great amount of  garlic flavor just a lovely situation here so   we're going to keep one piece off to the side  and we're going to go for a dip right here in   the middle as it focuses in here we go there's  the marinara goodness right there oh man this   is gonna be ridiculous already keep that focus  keep that focus hopefully that's coming through   right here with the lighting man this is looking  and smelling good instantly as i'm stirring this   around a bit just getting some on here you can  easily smell the marinara as well here we go pizza sauce and melted cheese this is  pretty much like having a pizza right now   in portable form technically oh man that is nice  the garlic action on this guy's a lovely situation   this is just delish wow i gotta say this is giving  that five cheese version that i did recently a run   for its money i love the flavor of the marinara  wow this is just insane i'm just gonna keep   showing you as much as i can with this and we  are gonna go for another lovely situation here   it's very thick i am so digging this right  now this is easily worth your time delicious   mmm man as this begins to drip in front of  you here right now as you're gonna see guys   it's really not as oily as the five cheese and  for obvious reasons there's not as much cheese   in this even though there's a lot of one type  of cheese that pizza cheese which is awesome   and of course it goes amazing with the  marinara sauce i am totally digging the flavor   it's like having a pizza right now but without  the crust but fortunately we've got those garlic   bread twists and i have to say guys i'm really  glad to have checked these out i do like the   parmesan better but i have to admit the garlic is  very amazing on this just loveliness all around   plenty of cheese and i gotta say it  is hugging it nicely just look at   that action just look at that here  we go let's give this another shot   it's a cheese pizza in your hand right now this  is so good i'm definitely a fan of the marinara   sauce over here at domino's whenever i get their  pan pizzas naturally it's the main sauce that they   have on all their pizzas but it goes amazing with  the pan because of the edges and the thickness of   the bread so i'm getting shades of that with  this because of the thickness of the dough but   guys the quality is crazy good on this right now  if you don't want as much cheese but you just want   maybe one type of it it goes amazing because of  the marinara sauce in general but like i said   it's like having a small cheese pizza for yourself  naturally with a protected hand because i've got   a napkin underneath it pretty tasty mmm all right  so let me grab this last one over here right now   and we'll lift up a little more of this to  give you another shot lovely action guys an   easy recommendation like i said it's got one type  of cheese on it which is primarily the mozzarella   but it really goes amazing with the marinara  here so when you add the garlic to it definitely   a lovely situation i guess parmesan would be nice  as well just for a different variation of cheese   but the garlic is amazing with the marinara sauce  and the single pizza type of cheese that i'm   having with this just delicious stuff so jumping  right to the rating guys this is another banger   of an entree over here at domino's with everything  you've seen and heard up to this point i'm gonna   have to give the all-new cheesy marinara dip and  garlic bread twists here at domino's a rock solid   9 out of 10 this one is not nearly as oily  as the other but honestly the combination is   exactly like having a cheese pizza with a little  extra garlic and i gotta say that combination is   just amazing beautiful situation in terms of  the amount that you get although i do wish it   had just a little bit more sauce believe it or  not it seems like it's very low in the tin so   it's a lot of dip at the same time considering  there's eight pieces of twists there i get that   but maybe just a little more in the tin would  be my recommendation but even still what you're   getting for the price point is pretty good  and the deliciousness that you're going to   experience with it is on point really good all  right so one quick question being that this   is the second of the oven baked dips that i've  checked out over here at domino's at this point   if you haven't seen that five cheese dip that i  just did recently of course you can find it in   the upper right hand corner of your display what  did you actually think of that one compared to   this which do you think is actually your favorite  out of the two drop those comments down below and   definitely let me know and with that this is  Ian K closing out another high quality foodie   feature for you here on peep this out reviews  bringing you brand new content every single week   here on my channel so while you stay tuned for  that next review coming real soon in the meantime   stay frosty well it looks like my left hand is  a little calloused up
