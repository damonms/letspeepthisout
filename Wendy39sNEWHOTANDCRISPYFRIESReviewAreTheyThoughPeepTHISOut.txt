 what's going on everyone and welcome back  to another high quality foodie feature for   you here on the channel where this time over  at wendy's because you've been asking and i'm   finally doing them that's right and you already  know it's their new hot and crispy fries so   stay tuned because they're up next welcome to  peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty well it's the moment of truth here at wendy's with  our all-new hot and crispy fries and right off the   bat the aroma in my car is kicking big time guys  you can really smell that awesome fried potato   goodness and it's lighting it up beautifully here  right now i'm definitely digging the presentation   as well all right so very simply what we've got  here is some natural cut potatoes featuring a   little of that potato skin action on the outside  which i'm absolutely digging and apparently these   are lightly battered for maximum crispiness  as well as heat retention and that definitely   appears to be the case because this container  was absolutely hot when i was setting up this   shot right now so for additional seasoning  of course we've got some sea salt to go with   because guys you got to have that on fries and  that's definitely going to be a nice finisher and   speaking of finishers of course we're gonna go  in for some buttermilk ranch action just to top   this one off because i gotta do that guys you all  know i'm a ranch guy so absolutely we're getting   into that so there you go it's the all-new hot  and crispy fries here at wendy's let's peep out   this flavor yes sir they're definitely coming in  hot with this one once i was handed the bag at   the counter guys i got to tell you this was  definitely feeling like it was freshly made   absolutely hot in my hands right now as well  and again the aroma of that fried potato action   is definitely awesome and again with that light  battered coating supposedly it has on the outside   we're going to actually see if that's actually  true in terms of the flavor let's just not waste   any more time guys let me pick up one of these  real quick take a look at that hopefully that'll   try and focus for you i always love the natural  cut of potatoes like this guys wendy's definitely   has some pretty awesome sea salt fries you got  to have the skin on them here we go they're   supposedly hot well it definitely is hot let's see  if it's crispy and if it's guaranteed here we go yeah wow that's actually really good it's almost  like a hearty type of potato that i'm biting into   it's very filling very rich mmm oh yeah absolutely  the sea salt that capper at the very end mmm   these are really good let me try and keep that  focused just a bit there i know it's contrasty   well we'll pull it back here we go all right lots  of salt on this one guys i'm really digging that   and again the crispiness is on point  mmm yeah hot and crispy guaranteed   love the marketing on the outside of this here  right now very nice oh yeah and apparently they're   so confident about this actually they're  actually giving you a guarantee for sure   guys i mean just take these back if you're not  satisfied and just get another one here but i   gotta say guys again i'm very impressed with the  quality of what i'm having here right now works   really really nice let's go for one more and  we're gonna get into some ranch here hang on   these are really good really good definitely  hot like i said the crispiness is on point   the salt is primo really nice all right so like  i said i'm a ranch guy i've got to have ranch   whenever i have any type of fried anything really  for the most part but fries of course go pretty   amazing and the buttermilk ranch over here at  wendy's is always a banging situation so let   me get this one open really quick and we'll give  this a go classic ranch it looks very very thick   and let's pull up a good one here now this one  looks pretty good all right contrasty i know this   is not working for me today there you go all right  let's give this a shot hot and crispy action with   some of their ranch sauce here let's give this a  go oh yeah all day long the tang the creaminess   elevated tang actually that i'm getting with  this and the crispiness of these fries are   really nice it's probably not going to focus  too much if you can kind of see right there   they are very potatoey on the inside guys i'm  really digging that and like i said they feel   very very hearty you can kind of see it right there  they filled out pretty nice there's really nothing   that's hollow about these it's really nicely cut  really nicely cut let's keep going in on these   oh yeah really good so let me just apologize  to you guys for waiting this long to do these   i can see why you wanted me to  check these out these are really   really good so i'm just going to keep dipping  for a few more times here lovely situation wow i don't know about the light batter they're  supposed to have but they seem elevated in some   way so kind of like checkers and rally's they  usually have like a light battering on the outside   the old satisfries i believe from bk had  something on the outside of them as well   and the kfc fries definitely had something on the  outside this one kind of feels like the standard   version to me but the quality seems a lot better  i mean really really nice and there was really   nothing wrong with the first round of these every  time i would review here anyway when i do get the   fries once in a while but the fact that these  were piping hot on top of it I think it could just be   playing with my head right now i don't know so  let's go for another couple on this real quick   i'm just giving you some glamour shots here with  the ranch action lovely situation with these hot   and crispy fries brand new here at wendy's i think  he's been up for about like a couple of months now   pretty tasty all right one more because you can  tell i'm liking these right we're doing so much   dipping action this is probably going to hold the  record for the amount of times i've done a dipping   shot for you guys of anything that i've reviewed  on my channel pretty nice situation very good   well there you go guys these are definitely  a winner in terms of the french fry situation   over here wendy's they're noticeably elevated in  terms of the overall quality and i gotta say again   once they gave me that bag it was piping hot i  can feel it when i was setting up the close-up   shots here in the car on top of it as well really  really nice just the perfect amount of sea salt   on this as well and overall a nice hearty bite  when you get into them so depending upon your   dipping sauce of choice for me obviously it's  ranch i'm sure ketchup would be great as well   you've got something to look forward to with these  very very tasty and definitely hot and crispy so with that said i'm gonna have to give these all  new hot and crispy fries here at wendy's a pretty   rock solid 9.5 out of 10 i mean  guys it virtually is a 10 but for me personally   i don't really feel there's actually like a  batter type of coating on the outside of that   but they're definitely made to order they're  definitely fresh they were piping hot and you   can really taste the quality biting into them and  of course with that sea salt capper on top of it   as well as the ranch for me just a beautiful  situation either way delicious stuff all right   now i'm sure there's a ton of you peeps that have  had these already so do me a quick favor drop some   comments down below what did you personally think  of them when you gave them a shot and how do you   think they compared to the other fries that are  out there in the fast food game are these actually   the tops for you drop those comments down below  and definitely let me know and with that this is   Ian K closing out another high quality foodie  feature for you
