 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K  ay stay frosty what's going on everyone and   welcome to the channel where today I'm over  at Wendy's to go in on what could be the most   glorious promo item they have ever had up to this  point and you better believe I'm tripling up on it   that's right guys I don't think you're prepared  for this one but let me just tell you a picture   is worth a thousand words right we'll try and come  up with a thousand words for this Feast your eyes   on the Italian Mozzarella triple cheeseburger  a lovely situation indeed plenty of fresh beef   and guys if you look on top we've got a fried  mozzarella cheese Patty to go in on with this   one as well so let's break this on down real quick  yeah guys not only is Wendy's going hard with this   one you better believe I'm going hard with it  as well this is looking pretty awesome right   now starting off with a very cool looking Garlic  Knot bun take a look at that guys it looks nice   and buttery on top let's pop it and take a look  underneath and right off the bat because this is   an Italian theme you've got plenty of marinara  sauce and guys that is all on top of a fried   mozzarella cheese Patty that's right fried up to  a crispy golden brown with plenty of mozzarella   cheese on the inside it's a fairly decent size as  well totally digging that and because we're going   hard you've got your choice of a single a double  or in this case a triple guys we've got three   fresh never Frozen beef patties absolutely looking  pretty awesome they are always definitely on point   over here at Wendy's separated by three slices of  asiago cheese and again a very lovely situation   this thing is massive it's tall it's gluttonous it  looks totally awesome and I can't wait to get into   this this is really really looking pretty amazing  so yeah how bad could this really be with marinara   sauce a fried mozzarella cheese Patty and all that  beef guys really awesome set off with that garlic   knot bun let's not waste any more time on this  one let's dive into it it's the all-new Italian   Mozzarella triple cheeseburger here at Wendy's  let's peep out this flavor yeah I'm always down   to do a triple cheeseburger review over here at  Wendy's because they are always pretty awesome and   when you've got the Italian theme to go with guys  this is crazy in my hands right now and I gotta   say with that garlic knot bun action a very lovely  situation indeed and if memory serves me correctly   this is actually the second time in fast food  that we've actually seen a cheese Patty of some   type at least here in the U.S I think the previous  one was the BFC Angus thick Burger over at Carl's   but guys when you have an Italian theme with  mozzarella cheese marinara sauce all the fried   goodness and plenty of beefy goodness with the  Asiago this is looking pretty crazy so without   further Ado I'm gonna try to wrap my mouth around  this I can't wait to do this guys it's the all new   Italian Mozzarella triple cheeseburger here at  Wendy's let's peep this out wow this looks crazy oh my God so much beef lots of asiago cheese mmm  crazy juicy beef on this one guys I got plenty   of beefy action with that with the asiago  cheese and very little of that mozzarella   of the Patty there but if you take a look  in the very top I'll squeeze it down for   you look at all that gooey action I can't wait  to get further in this is crazy delicious the   marinara is perfectly Tangy got just the right  amount of flavor there but man crazy good and   you know what I think I'm gonna go for this  one right on the very top right over there   let's give this a go here we go super excited  to be doing this right now it's a lot of fun mmm oh oh my god wow I'm just gonna call it hands down the greatest  Italian fast food Burger I have ever had right now   guys I mean naturally with the gluttonous goodness  of all that beef right there you're getting an   abundance of that so even if you go with the  single or the double you're going to be just   fine but that cheese is amazing the mozzarella is  super flavorful it's got the crispy action it's   very much in your face in terms of flavor and of  course with that garlic knot bun on the top guys   this is just screaming gluttonous goodness with an  Italian theme super delicious on this along with   that sauce very tasty you know honestly there was  really no way something like this can fail unless   it's just not made correctly and naturally with  the Garlic Knot bun I'm totally digging that guys   that's really the unsung hero with this because it  dovetails beautifully into all the other flavors   so you're getting that garlicky goodness right up  front and the softness of it is awesome and then   naturally the fried mozzarella cheese Patty is  dovetailing into everything else but guys I'm glad   they didn't just do more mozzarella to separate  each of the patties the Asiago is nice and Mild   so you can kind of taste that Duality between the  mozzarella and that type of cheese and of course   the flavor of the beef and guys again everything  together is just singing on this now naturally a   triple is way over the top I think a double would  be just perfect with this but guys very very super   delicious and of course you gotta showcase the  fresh never Frozen beef over here definitely a   banging situation let's go for another couple  of bites in this guys crazy delicious  yeah that fried mozzarella cheese Patty definitely  makes this one on top of everything else and the   fact that it's perfectly fried and crispy golden  brown with everything really adds to the overall   experience and of course I got to keep giving  you the money shots on this one because guys   it is crazy gluttonous it's pretty much the  epitome of fast food guys it really is with   an Italian theme and again with all the flavors  coming together beautifully and The Duality of   flavors with the mozzarella and the Asiago a  banging variant on an Italian theme over here   at Wendy's Wendy's is definitely going hard with  this one and I'm definitely having a hard time   trying to go further into this so let's go for one  more bite we'll wrap the review with the rating   coming up next but guys super delicious you knew  it was gonna be if you've made it this far into   the review I know you're going to be giving  this one a shot I'm very curious to see what   you think about it down below in the comments  one more bite and we'll wrap this one up hang on mmm not too much else to say about this one guys  although I gotta say I'm glad there is no marinara   sauce on the bottom because that would definitely  make this a Slip Sliding situation especially with   these patties right here naturally with another  slice of cheese in the bottom that would probably   correct that but with everything that you're  seeing here it is super gluttonous the fresh   number Frozen beef is on point and that garlic  knot bun is an amazing situation I'm already   looking forward to seeing what else they come  up with with this one down the line because it   already needs to come back on the menu even though  this just launched this is really delicious and   easily worth your time crazy crazy awesome on  this one so as if there was any doubt I'm gonna   have to give the Italian Mozzarella triple  cheeseburger here at Wendy's the obvious   10 out of 10 guys like I said there is no way that  this could have failed unless it just wasn't made   correctly and everything was on point with that  the nice softness of that garlic knot bun I gotta   say was amazing and naturally with that fried  cheese Mozzarella Patty action that was an amazing   situation just with that alone adding a little bit  of the marinara sauce would definitely keep the   flavors going but naturally when you add three  100% beef patties fresh never Frozen a banging   situation with that guys very very delicious but  again very gluttonous I'd probably recommend as   the double as kind of like the best version  to go with strictly because I think you can   probably handle it better but at the same time if  you're a fan of the beef over here at Wendy's is   what they're known for primarily you're definitely  going to dig it it's pretty banging over here it   really is all right so like I said during the  review I'm very curious to see what you think   about this one so drop some comments down below  when you give this one a shot let me know which   version you got the single to double or this crazy  triple the Godzilla of the versions naturally but   drop those comments down below let me know what  you thought of this one and with that this is   Ian K closing out another high
