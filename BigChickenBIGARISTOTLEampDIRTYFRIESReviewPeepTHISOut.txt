 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty all right everyone let's get it it's Ian K back again with another high quality foodie feature for you here on peep this out reviews this time checking out shaquille o'neal's big chicken for the very first time here in glendale california and guys let me just say i think we're gonna have a lot of fun with these two items off the menu right now starting off with the very appropriately named big aristotle feast your eyes on this one a very serious looking chicken sandwich and i gotta say the presentation looks awesome definitely digging the white castle style sleeves these come in but this is anything but white castle there's a lot of heft in this chicken sandwich right now i'm a handful according to what it says on the side here and it really is as you can see we've got a very nice brioche style bun on this big aristotle and it's looking really really nice on the inside is the good stuff as you can see that chicken patty definitely huge guys topped off with some really good stuff here sweet and smoky memphis barbecue sauce on the top we've got plenty of crispy onions and a solid amount of bacon to go with and i gotta say it looks really nice holding it together is some organic muenster cheese a very nice situation on the very bottom we've got more of that sweet and smoky memphis barbecue sauce just an awesome presentation overall very appetizing but we're not stopping there we're gonna get dirty with it with some of their dirty fries a very healthy portion of fries topped off with cheese bacon banana peppers and barbecue ranch and i gotta say i am loving the way this looks the banana peppers definitely add a lot of pop to it and as you can see no shortage of bacon whatsoever and aside from the barbecue ranch we've got a little bit of the shaq sauce action to go with here essentially a chipotle barbecue sauce mixed with some mayo and we're gonna go in on some of that with some of the fries as well but guys very cool presentation on both of these so far very appetizing let's see if the flavor is going to deliver it's the big aristotle with a serious side of dirty fries here at big chicken let's peep out this flavor well shaq let me just start this one off by saying you pretty much got me already with the marketing this is a pretty cool presentation i really like the whole sleeve aspect of how this looks here but what i like even better is what i'm about to get into because this chicken sandwich looks absolutely serious look at that guys that is no joke they are not messing around with the quality of the chicken here we've got the naked truth brand on display here antibiotic-free hormone-free goodness no preservatives and i gotta say it looks absolutely amazing so before i get into this and like always if you guys are fans of high quality delicious looking food reviews make sure to hit that subscribe button down below don't forget to tap that bell icon so you can be notified as soon as brand new content drops every week guys the big aristotle very appropriately named let's get into it that is thick huge chicken wow right off the break that sweet and smoky memphis barbecue sauce is delivering exactly what it's supposed to it's a little bit of sweet little bit of smoky action with it there but it dovetails right into the light crispiness of the chicken and guys the chicken is super thick on this one all the crispy onions as well the bacon everything in one shot all inside this brioche style bun guys i'm gonna go for one more bite we're gonna give you some close-ups this thing is pretty awesome let's keep going pretty awesome size on this home style chicken patty guys this is really really solid it takes up a bulk of the sandwich as it should because that's the major highlight of what it is it truly is big chicken but all those other ingredients are a nice situation the muenster cheese i'm not tasting too much of but it is definitely holding everything together on the inside so this is primarily the fried onions and the bacon and that sauce to go with and the chicken itself is very flavorful and let me also say i'm very glad i've got a little chicken sandwich diaper in the very back here because while i don't have a lot of spillage it's nice to know i'm protected just in case because there is a decent amount of sauce and it really works nicely with everything here yeah i'm definitely a fan of muenster cheese in general it's one of my all-time favorite cheeses but when it comes to what i'm tasting on this right now it's very very mild but guys the quality is very high and that's a testament to the applegate naturals brand which they have prominently displayed all around the location and i gotta say that's a very solid thing guys it's non-gmo antibiotic free for the cheese and with naked truth as you heard me mention earlier that's also antibiotic and hormone free along with no preservatives so you're getting an all-natural chicken sandwich here with some pretty high quality ingredients and the size to match because guys it's big chicken let's go for some more bites on this one i really want to go further in it's just so thick yeah i am really loving how juicy the chicken is on this and on top of the light coating that it's got you can pretty much taste all the flavors pretty nicely here with the exception of the cheese again being just a little on the milder side but with that barbecue sauce with just the crunchiness of the onions the juiciness of the chicken the light coating that's got on the outside of the chicken itself it's a lovely situation but before we go any further i really want to try a little bit of the shaq sauce so let's see if we can kind of put this on here just a little bit here a little bit of that spicy chipotle barbecue sauce actually just regular barbecue sauce and mayo together let's see exactly how this is with everything on the sandwich super creamy smooth rich a little bit of extra sweetness with that one because it's barbecue sauce in general wow but with the bacon that's a lovely situation and speaking of a lovely situation let me put this down for a quick second we need to get into some dirty fries guys and i gotta say that presentation looks amazing very colorful overall and just a beautiful amount of pop all over the place here this is looking really nice no shortage of that bacon let's get into it and again i'm just impressed by the overall presentation of everything that i'm having here right now because as you guys can see there's a decent amount in here guys and i love the way that it looks there's so much color and everything on this here so let me pull some of these fries up a little bit of that barbecue ranch action a little bit of the bacon we've got some really really nice situations here guys take a look at that lots of bacon actually as you guys can see with the fries they're more like kind of like steak fries but they're very thin let's give it a shot with everything on here flavor a lot of flavor and i'm talking with my mouth full because i got to get it out there instantly the flavor hits you with that barbecue ranch that is a beautiful situation and then the nice acidity and the snap and the crunch of the banana peppers very vibrant in flavor and of course the crispiness of those fries speaking of which let me pull one of these fries up here for you just you can kind of see they're very thin as you can see they're almost like shaved but they give you a decent amount of them guys there's a lot in this platter right now it's got a little bit of firmness as you're biting down into it and the saltiness is pretty nice as well and speaking of the saltiness you'd think with all this bacon on top that there would be a lot of salt flavor going on here i'm gonna pick up a chunk just to show you but there really isn't that's quality bacon guys nice situation and the banana peppers i've never had on something of this caliber this way it really goes great for presentation on top of flavor so i'm gonna go for this huge bite we're gonna go for some more of that shaq sauce and we're gonna round this one out after a few more close-ups hang out yeah those banana peppers are awesome with this a major highlight i'm a huge fan already so let's go for a little bit of the shaq sauce we'll pour a little bit on here nice guys look at that let's just do it lovely situation here there is just so much goodness and i am loving the experience of this right now so really love the fact that the fries themselves are not the typical standard french fry they're very thin but there's plenty of bacon and a little dusting of cheese it's nothing crazy but it's really the barbecue ranch that goes with and that goes amazing with those banana peppers right there one more bite let's do it awesome awesome with shaq sauce that is awesome a little bit of elevated sweetness on top of the pungentness of the banana peppers and then the nice hickory smoked flavor from the bacon themselves guys that's a win-win right there that is a great add-on and i would definitely recommend giving these a shot if you guys are in the area dirty fry your meal that's all i got to say dirty fry your meal all right let me try and keep this in focus as much as i can for you guys a very cool first outing over here at big chicken very high quality overall and with the naked truth and the applegate naturals brands on display you're getting some great non-gmo antibiotic-free goodness of course no hormones no preservatives all that good stuff and just a really deliciously tasting chicken sandwich to go with and of course you can't beat all the crispy goodness on this one the bacon is awesome and of course all the crispy onions on top of that and then when you dirty up the goodness right over there guys there's really nothing else to really say about this one this is a requirement it really goes amazingly well with that barbecue ranch and those banana peppers are an amazing addition to this one just delicious stuff overall and a high recommendation all right so starting off with the big aristotle i think you can pretty much tell from my review i enjoyed this chicken sandwich right now guys it pretty much delivered across the board with the exception of the muenster cheese being just not quite there for me in terms of flavor i mean it was mild don't get me wrong it was really holding everything together but everything else on that chicken sandwich was incredible because it really showcased what it was supposed to have on it essentially the sweet and smoky memphis bbq sauce the bacon the chicken itself obviously nice and juicy with that light breading a lovely situation and of course the crispy fried onions you gotta have something on a sandwich like that guys it's barbecue sauce how could you not have the fried goodness so with all that said i'm gonna have to give the big aristotle here at big chicken a rock solid 9 out of 10 this thing really delivered and like i said it's going to be very hard to top this one going down the line but i'm going to have a lot of fun trying because believe me i'm going to be back to do just that and as for those rock solid dirty fries that's going to get an easy 10 out of 10 aside from the awesome shapes because guys they look very different from standard steak fries that i've had before just very similar although thinner the toppings were off the chart with that one there the cheese was a little bit more of a garnish on this particular one so everything on that was really the banana peppers and of course the barbecue ranch and tons of bacon there is no shortage of the good stuff on that guys and the flavor is very pungent very vibrant it really comes through and guys an easy recommendation like i said earlier dirty fry your meal up you're going to thank me for it okay now the question is if you're in the glendale area here in southern california or even las vegas where their other location is there'll be some other ones that are going to be opening up throughout the year are you going to be giving
