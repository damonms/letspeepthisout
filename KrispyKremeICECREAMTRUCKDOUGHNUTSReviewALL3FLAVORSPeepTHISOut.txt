 welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty what's going on everyone and welcome to the  channel it's Ian K where i just got back from   krispy kreme after scooping up their latest  summer promo and let's just say if you guys   are fans of nostalgic ice cream i think you're  gonna dig what you're about to see right now   that's right and you already know so check  this out guys feast your eyes on their ice   cream truck donuts i have to say a very colorful  situation over here at krispy kreme as always   these three are looking really beautiful and for  the next three weeks we've got this available to   you yes sir this is one colorful situation  starting off with the firecracker popsicle   inspired donut on the left what this is is an  original glazed doughnut dipped in firecracker   popsicle flavored icing and blue raspberry sugar  then it's topped off with dollops of firecracker   popsicle flavored cream and original cream on  top of that guys very very nice and as we swing   over to the other end what we've got here is their  vanilla king cone inspired donut and what this one   is is a donut filled with vanilla custard cream  that's then dipped in chocolate icing and topped   off with a blend of sugar cone pieces chopped  nuts and finished with a drizzle of chocolate   icing and guys i gotta say the top of this one  is looking very busy but still very very nice   looking and rounding us out here in the middle is  the creamsicle inspired donut very simply this is   a donut filled with vanilla custard cream that's  then dipped in creamsicle flavored icing that's   then topped off with a drizzle of icing and mini  sprinkles so definitely simple on this one guys   but it still looks very colorful and next to the  other two here i gotta say this is a very colorful   box guys i definitely can't wait to get into these  so let's do just that these are the all-new ice   cream truck donuts here at krispy kreme available  for the next three weeks beginning july 18th   let's peep out this flavor yes sir say what you  will about krispy kreme guys they really know how   to dress up their donuts very nicely especially  the promo ones it really doesn't matter what   season it is what holiday it is it's definitely  a banging situation here okay i'm gonna go for a   couple of bites on all three of these guys because  naturally this is arriving at perfect timing   because this is a cheat day for me right now so  of course krispy kreme is coming to the rescue   here guys let's feast your eyes on this one more  time this firecracker popsicle is looking really   awesome on this and i love all that glazed action  right here guys let's get into this one let's give   it a shot i can't wait to do it enough talking  let's get down to business let's peep this out oh wow the blue it tastes just like the  ice pop whoa that is delicious man   i got a beautiful mix of the classic krispy kreme  glaze on top of that blue raspberry sugar action   guys this is really very flavorful very tasty and  honestly if this was actually very cold right now   this would simulate that pop pretty nicely  guys very very nice gotta admit i'm really   digging the overall presentation the nice  softness on the inside the denseness of it   and again plenty of flavor especially from that  classic krispy kreme glaze this is really really   good let's go for another couple on this i think  maybe we'll do like three bites of each depending   upon how good they are so far this is starting  off pretty beautifully let's keep going in that light cream in the middle the red that is  so delicious right now oh man the blue raspberry   is easily with standing out amongst everything  else but the nice creaminess of the cream and the   overall feeling of this one really gives you the  simulation that you're having that popsicle guys   that firecracker goodness the familiar goodness  is definitely pretty beautiful on this very   very nice indeed let's go for one more little  quick bite before we move on very tasty on this oh man wow this is really good   but of course the sweetness is beginning to  kick right now so very tasty and i'm really   digging that blue raspberry goodness on there  that is really good okay let's clean the palette very very tasty and i think i'm gonna do the  creamsicle variation because we want to leave   that busy looking one for the very end but as  you can see here guys a very lovely situation   on the creamsicle variant very very nice indeed of  course this one's got that little puncture wound   for the vanilla cream on the inside and that  icing there as well let's give this one a shot   very very excited to be having krispy kreme  right now this is pretty bagging let's do it hmm yeah that creamsicle action is tasty   it's simple the vanilla cream on the  inside very nice the custard action   nice definitely a bit of an orange vibe with this  one but guys again very very simple the vanilla   cream is nice this is really kind of the basic  out of the three actually and i honestly it's   okay for what it is the vanilla drizzle on the  very top that you're seeing there everything else   is looking nice on this one presentation wise it  definitely presents nicely but overall the flavor   is just very light in that creamsicle department  which is fine guys it really is considering what   i just had right now that firecracker is easily  the most flavorful out of these two at least   but guys not bad let's go for one more bite  in this one then we'll move on to the third i like it though it's good and here's another  quickie shot of that cream vanilla center on   the inside of this one it can probably use just a  little bit more and actually more of it is on one   side of it and as you can see here it's kind of  like really punctured on the very side so that's   where you're gonna get more of it there it may  depend upon how you get yours you may get more   cream you may get less it may be on one side only  where mine appears to be but actually guys this is   not bad not bad at all okay let's clean the pallet  and we're gonna get into the big gun hang on man this one now looks pretty amazing and guys  this is really the creme de la creme i'm thinking   in terms of presentation because look at how crazy  busy this one is this just looks amazing right now   guys i mean the blend of all that goodness the  sugar cone pieces on the very top the vanilla   action very very excited with that vanilla custard  action right there as well filled let's give this   a shot very very excited this is the vanilla king  cone inspired donut here krispy kreme let's do it oh those crispy pieces the sugar cone  are very soft actually not crunchy   i'm getting more from the nuts on the very top  there which is fine chocolate which is not bad   not getting too much vanilla yet because  actually i haven't really gotten to the   cream just yet it's pretty much  on the side as you can see there   but man lots of chocolate goodness on this  this one is very hearty very dense and i got to   say a little bit of an over abundance of chocolate with this one let's go for another bite on it okay there's the vanilla better but  still a lot of chocolate overload on this   it's good though guys and i like the actual  addition of those sugar cone pieces even though   i wish they were a little bit crunchier but i  guess that's what the backup nuts are for to give   you that crunch to simulate it maybe but they're  very very soft so a little disappointing in that   but i do have to say the overall flavor  is classic krispy kreme on this so   you're getting that nice fluffiness of the  yeast donuts naturally they're filled decently   at least with this one with that vanilla  custard again not bad here but overall guys   this one is just okay in terms of the  variation it's not bad for the flavor naturally   but a little too much chocolate not enough vanilla  and a little bit of the um softness of those sugar   cookie pieces or the cone i should say on the  very top of this one so one more little bite   and we'll finish this one up but guys so far  i think you know which one i think is going to   be the best because guys i pretty much led off  with it so let's go for one more bite hang on well i gotta say this is a fun little collabo  between krispy kreme popsicle and good humor guys   you're getting a little bit of everything with  this one which is a really cool thing but i think   you're gonna know which one i'm gonna like out  of the three even though they're all pretty tasty   there's one that really does take the top in  terms of flavor in terms of what it's simulating   but guys what you're gonna get here is a nice  combination of sugary goodness from krispy kreme   and the freshness is definitely on point with  plenty of the flavor that you know and love in   general as the base so very lovely on this one and  definitely a fun promo to check out for the summer   all right so as for the ratings for this three  let's start by going backwards we're gonna start   off with the vanilla king cone and for that one  i'm gonna have to give it a pretty decent   8 out of 10 guys a very fresh krispy kreme donut  no doubt with a decent amount of filling as i went   into it further but naturally the overabundance of  chocolate kind of overpowered just a little bit of   everything and while the pieces on the very top  of that sugar cone weren't as crispy as i'd like   it still actually was a nice touch and overall  with the drizzle and the extra nuts for even more   crunch on top of that one it was still a very very  tasty donut no doubt and if you love chocolate   you have something to look forward to with that  one for sure and as for the creamsicle inspired   doughnut that one's gonna get just an okay 6  out of 10 it's not going to knock your socks off   guys but the old familiar flavor of creamsicle  really does stand out on it and naturally it's   very simple with the vanilla custard on the inside  of a regular krispy kreme donut in general and   naturally with the icing it's a little bit on the  sweet side but a little hint of orange possibly   in there as well but again very simple for what it  is and it did get the job done even though again   it is a simple donut all right and by process  of elimination the obvious king of this trio at   least in my personal opinion is easily going to  be the firecracker popsicle-inspired donut with   a rock-solid 9 out of 10 guys that one really  delivered that authentic flavor and i got to say   that blue raspberry icing really set it apart  from the other ones by far it really felt like   i was having a true firecracker popsicle pop and  actually guys that's the expectation from it right   you want the flavor to be like that it really  was pretty solid i only wish all the other   flavors really kind of stood out just a little  bit but the blue raspberry goodness easily shines   through and like i said if i had that cold and  blindfolded i would assume i'm having something   very similar to that popsicle definitely a banging  situation and easily the top out of the three   all right so do me a quick favor chances are if  you've made it this far into the review you've   probably already given these a shot or you're  curious about giving them a shot so if you do
