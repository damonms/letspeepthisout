 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian  K stay frosty what's going on everyone   and welcome to the channel where today I'm  over at Pizza Hut to check out their latest   limited time only promo that they're  building as cheesy crispy and loaded   and on the Real I think this looks to be  the trifecta of Truth guys at least in the   appearance Department Feast your eyes on what  I'm looking at here here we go with the Pizza   Hut melts a very cheesy crispy loaded situation  for sure let's break this one on down real quick   yes sir this is definitely looking pretty  killer in the presentation guys and I have to say   initially with that parmesan dusting on the top  it looks pretty awesome already all right so the   chicken bacon parmesan melt is the focus for this  review today and what it features are two slices   of their thin and crispy crust that's filled with  chicken bacon creamy alfredo sauce and plenty of   cheese it definitely looks pretty loaded and it  smells really awesome for dipping we have a little   side of ranch guys and that's definitely going  to go pretty nice I think with the Alfredo and   just the overall crispiness here so of course I  can't wait to get into that but again coming back   to that appearance this is looking really tasty  and I have to say again the aroma is lighting up   my car beautifully so let's not waste any more  time on this one this is the all-new chicken   bacon parmesan melt here at Pizza Hut let's peep  out this flavor well I don't know about you guys   but I'm getting shades of Papa John's Papadias  with this one guys but again it all comes down   to that crust being very thin and crispy and it  looks really really awesome so let's get into   this one here let me pick up one of these pieces  oh yeah definitely a very crispy situation for   sure this feels pretty nice basically a foldable  Pizza that they don't want you to share because   I think when you taste it you're going to want  to have it all to yourself but it looks really   fantastic the parmesan dusting on the outside and  again the chicken bacon parmesan action on the   inside I think is going to dovetail beautifully  with that crust let's get into this one all right   one last time it's the chicken bacon parmesan  melt here at Pizza Hut let's peep this out mmm oh a lot of cheese a lot of alfredo  sauce mmm but that crust is really nice   right off the break the saltiness is right up  on point with this one guys and the thinness   of the crust is really tasty this does feel like  their version of the papadia I'm probably going   to be saying that all throughout this review  because it looks similar but the crispiness   of that crust is the differentiating factor  with this one it feels very very light but   very dense with all the goodness on the inside  of this let's keep going in guys pretty nice hmm yeah this is a pretty decadent flavor combination  guys the chicken the bacon and the parmesan swing   beautifully with the crispiness of the  crust with this and naturally with that   alfredo sauce on the inside and the cheese  it's very decadent very gluttonous and I'm   totally digging that wash on the outside it's  a little buttery but at the same time it really   adds overall with the parmesan goodness  that crust again very beautifully toasted   it really is pretty nice even on the bottom  fairly much pretty good there guys it looks   really really good and again very very great  in the presentation with this one very tasty   and again so far the trifecta of the description  of this one Being Cheesy crispy and loaded is   absolutely true so far so let's go for a little  dip into what this comes with their ranch sauce   action I have a feeling this is going to be  amazing and as most of you know I am totally down   with the ranch it's my all-time favorite dipping  sauce with just about anything and when you think   about pizza of course that's a no-brainer so let's  go for a dip on this we'll give it a nice little   bit there nice and thick looking really really  beautiful let's give it a shot with the ranch mmm oh oh oh come on now that is a  beautiful addition Tangy tart creamy   mmm crispy cheesy loaded a beautiful combination  of goodness on this one guys that is pretty tasty   a decent amount on the inside of this  one here although I do wish I had just   a little bit more bacon but at the same time  everything else is swinging beautifully so   let's go for one more bite of this one we'll  wrap the review up with the rating coming up next   because I think you guys know what to expect with  this at least based upon this version it's crispy   it's got a decent amount of cheese on the inside  and I'm totally digging the overall feeling of the   bacon the parmesan everything with this along with  the thinness and the crispiness of that crust it's   pretty banging one more bite and we'll wrap this one  up hang on mmm let me give you a look at the other   half here guys this really is a very well done  well thought out option over here at Pizza Hut   at least for competitive purposes and again you're  probably going to be comparing this to the papadia   and rightfully so because it's similar it's like a  folded over personal pizza with all the goodies on   the inside but the wild card being that parmesan  crust that this one has got the thin and crispy   it really adds a nice Dimension and additional  crunch to this one on top of the flavorful inside   with this one guys again crispy loaded creamy  cheesy whatever you want to say it is it's very   flavorful and again pairing it up with that ranch  is a lovely situation a very nice job on this one   yeah guys pretty tasty and I had a feeling  I was gonna really dig this one considering   Ranch is coming along with it and of course the  Alfredo sauce the chicken the bacon the parmesan   goodness it really goes very very nicely together  but just in case that's not to your liking there   are three other options available on the menu  that I may have to swing on back to give a go on   because guys that thin and crispy crust is a real  differentiating factor with that one and it's very   hearty to dive into the crispiness is pretty awesome  and overall the flavor on the version that I had   today definitely delivered pretty banging so with  that said I'm gonna have to give the chicken bacon   parmesan melt here at Pizza Hut a pretty Rock  Solid 8 out of 10 guys very delicious across the   board with just the right amount of saltiness my  only gripe with it however is I wish I had just a   little bit more bacon on the inside but generally  it was pretty much loaded as they say the cheese   was pretty plentiful and of course it goes pretty  amazing with that alfredo sauce on the inside but   again I keep coming back to it that outer crust  is the wild card it's very delicious and it's a   trendsetter for this particular product definitely  recommend giving this one a shot
