 what's going on everyone and welcome or  welcome back to the channel it's Ian K   where today i'm over at good old b-dubs  to take a look at a fan favorite flavor   mash-up now appearing on their menu for  a limited time only that's right and you   already know so stay tuned because the doritos  flamin hot nacho boneless wings are up next   welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty all right it's a super crispy day here in southern  cali right now and i'm doing something that's   going to be flaming hot so i'm already in for it i  have a feeling guys feast your eyes on them though   here we go the doritos flamin hot nacho boneless  wings a very lovely situation of colorful goodness   and i gotta say this is looking pretty  awesome let's break this one down real quick   all right so what i've got here is their lunch  combo which actually features the one dollar   up charge to get this doritos flaming hot nacho  goodness guys but i have to say the presentation   is looking awesome those boneless nugs do look  pretty colorful but starting off with the side   item what we've got here is some natural cut fries  a very nice situation there a decent portion of   them but guys the main star of the show and this  is the reason why you're here is to check out the   doritos flaming hot nacho flavored sauce that's  drizzled all over these 100% boneless nuggs and   i'm saying nuggs because that's exactly what these  are guys i don't know about wings but these are   definitely chicken nuggets 100% white meat breaded  up and fried to a crispy golden brown and then   doused in that doritos flaming hot nacho flavored  sauce and guys look at the garnishment that it   comes with on the side of course you got to have  the regular doritos flamin hot chips we definitely   want to sprinkle these all across here and as  you're going to see i'm going to do just that   just to lace it up with the goodness so the  combination of doritos flaming hot nacho goodness   on top of boneless wings with a very striking  looking red color i got to say this is looking   really really solid all right so before i burn  up even further before getting into these this   is the all-new doritos flaming hot nacho boneless  wings aka nuggs over here at b-dubs let's peep out   this flavor yeah it is no joke the temperature is  rising in my car right now and that red striking   goodness that you're seeing in front of you  here is really setting the tone for what i'm   about to get into here guys let me lift up one of  these i gotta say really really cool looking with   that doritos goodness on here take a look at that  try and focus that in for you there it is doused   pretty nicely plenty of the chips falling all  over the place thankfully i'm outfitted for battle   and as i'm clearing my throat we're getting  into it finally here we go it's the doritos   flaming hot nacho boneless wings  aka nuggs here at b-dubs here we go there goes the heat oh this  is fun yeah this is good   yeah that's definitely beginning to kick  and i forgot to tell you guys you also get   a drink in this case i've got some  unsweetened tea hang on real quick wow that flaming hot is strong  this is nice guys take a look here   loveliness on that sauce situation and of course  with that boneless action that you can see here   as well plenty of the doritos chopped up all  over the place this is a very very lovely sauce   wow my mouth is really lighting  up now this is really really tasty   let's keep going in and of course we're going  to go for a dip very soon in some ranch hang on wow yes sir you know i'm not normally a fan  of chicken nugs so to speak at places like   buffalo wild wings because the regular wings  are obviously where it's at but you know what   i was very curious to try their version of them  and i gotta say i am really digging the coating   to meat ratio here guys as you can see it's  a fairly thick piece of chicken meat there   and you gotta love the fact that it's really  sauced up beautifully it really presents pretty   nicely and these are juicy pieces of white  meat and that's always a concern considering   the dryness that you can probably encounter with  these if they're not made right and fortunately   these are made right and again made so well in  fact that flamin hot is really kicking hold on wow that is really very  strong all right real quick   let me grab one of their fries here  their natural cut goodness there as   you can see salted up very nicely  it looks like let's give this a shot not bad few minutes old it's fairly crispy  i'm digging it but this is where it's at so   let's go for one more bite on this one before we  get into a little dipping action with some ranch   because i really need it i'm beginning  to numb up slightly from the sauce   and i'm really digging the extra crunch from  the chips too pretty nice hang on so good all   right so let's go for a little ranch action a very  lovely situation of semi-focused goodness there we   go it's beginning to come in let me pick up one  of these again wow this is a good one right here   guys look at all of that action right there plenty  of the flaming hot goodness i love the accent   of the chips on this this is really really good  so as they're beginning to fall in here let's keep   that focus in wow beautiful color contrast with  that lovely lovely lovely let's give it a shot i love ranch anyway but with this chicken the  coating the flaming hot goodness oh yeah you're   trying to come up on me right now but it's not  working for you it's not working for you okay   maybe it is working just a little bit wow that is  really good let's go for another one on this very   lovely situation i think i'm going to take this  whole one down real fast here hang on one second banging situation tartness creaminess that's  done so well mmm goes amazing with that   so amazing in fact that it's  still beginning to kick hang on their unsweetened tea is pretty good over  here at bdubs very nice all right guys   let's go for one more bite on this one before we  wrap the review up with the rating coming up next   because guys i'm literally sweating to death  right now this is seriously a fun experience   flaming hot goodness and i gotta say again the  presentation is just amazing on this i am totally   digging the accent of the flamin hot nacho chips  this really is a very nice accent and a very cool   duality in terms of the heat and the crunchiness  that i'm getting extra because of those chips   and again just a banging presentation pretty  decent in terms of the price point i think for   the size of everything that you're getting but  guys something super fun to check out but very   heated have something to drink on the side you're  gonna need it buffalo wild wings well so much for   that last bite that actually turned into the last  wrap up for the review considering my mouth is   completely numb right now i'm totally digging the  experience guys it's a very cool feeling naturally   if you've had flaming hot you obviously know but  guys very fun checking those out indeed all right   so with all that said i'm gonna have to give the  all new doritos flaming hot nacho boneless wings   over here at b-dubs a pretty awesome 9 out of  10 and the only reason i'm actually saying that   is because guys i should have gotten a bag of  the flaming hot doritos nachos i was expecting   to actually get that considering the little cup  that i got there on the side it was just enough   to cover everything and i get it but it would have  been cool to have the actual namesake in the chip   form in the bag for presentation purposes but  at the same time guys very tasty on those super   juicy on that meat with just the right amount  of coating but again a very lovely sauce on   that man my mouth is completely numbed up right  now a very cool feeling indeed definitely check   these out if you've got b-dubs in the area all  right do me a quick favor drop some comments   down below let me know if you've got b-dubs in  your area and if you're going to be giving this   one a go and if you have already given these a  shot what did you personally think of them were   they just as hot for you as they appear to be for  me right now because guys i can't really feel the   inside of my mouth it's pretty awesome drop those  comments down below and definitely let me know   and with that this is Ian K closing out another  high quality foodie feature for you here on   peep
