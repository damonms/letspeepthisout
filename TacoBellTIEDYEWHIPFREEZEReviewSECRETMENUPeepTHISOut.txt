little secret menu fun as you guys obviously saw by the title of  this review guys it's the tie-dye whip freeze that's right we're doing the whip variant of this one here right now and take a close look at this this is looking amazing already a lot of strawberry goodness all throughout this one but it's a mixture of that wild strawberry along with mountain dew baja blast and of course the new pineapple freeze a very frosty looking situation indeed guys very very inviting very excited to give this a try especially with that cream the vanilla cream added to this on top of it so before I take the first sip because I really want to right now it's crazy hot and like always if you guys are fans of high quality delicious looking food reviews make sure to hit that subscribe button down below don't forget to tap that Bell icon so you can be notified as soon as brand new content drops every week guys the tie-dye whip freeze here at Taco Bell a secret menu item technically very easy to see on the menu you can just put these together but look how cool this looks again here let's give this a go go for that sip let's do it mmm Wow okay dominant flavor right away that cream the pineapple baja blast is coming through and then at the very end believe it or not is the strawberry and you would think that the strawberry would actually be the dominant one based upon the mixture here but as you can see it is pretty much even across the board as I am mixing this up here so it's beginning to blend I'm gonna give you a close up here in just a second but this is definitely different and something really fun to do mmm that extra creaminess along with the pineapple is amazing in general but when you add baja Mountain Dew blast the baja blast I should say along with that wild strawberry this is a total summer event if you ask me because it's blending everything they have on the menu which is fruity to begin with and then you're adding that vanilla creaminess so that soft serve like goodness is there as well if you guys haven't seen my review yet of the pineapple whip freeze take a look at that popping up on your screen here right now it was definitely something amazing but I gotta say when you add the other fruity mixtures along with it it really kicks it up a notch so actually this is not going to taste like a dole whip float like drink like that one I thought did but when you add the strawberry when you add the Mountain Dew Baja blast everything together all those citrus flavors really do make it a very lovely situation and obviously the tie-dye effect with this it's kind of coming through as you're seeing that there as I'm mixing it up you're beginning to see more of the pineapple and everything on the inside but very very lovely situation on this one and again like I said that Vanilla creamer added to it really kicks it up a notch so I wouldn't go for this actually as a secret menu item just as is get it with that Vanilla creamer you might as well because it's all there and give it a go because it's delicious mmm that is really good and again a dollar on happy hour for this the size amazing the flavor is amazing it's a true taste of summer and believe me I'm really getting cooled off easily right now I got to say and it is well over 80 plus degrees outside right now so this is really doing a number on me in a beautiful situation type of way mmm I am really really enjoying that I'm not enjoying this actually more than the regular pineapple whip freeze because naturally this is more of like a hybrid of that type of drink it's very fruity but the pineapple whip freeze on its own is amazing so that would really be the reason to check it out naturally I'm getting tongue-tied because of the sweetness overload that I'm feeling right now I feel more of the sweetness with this naturally because of all those flavors together than the regular pineapple whip freeze which was subtle but it was definitely a very very nice sweetness on its own just not as elevated as this feels right now but guys look what it is I mean all of the flavors together in one in a very beautiful situation and again after two three four sips that I've been taking so far here there is still a lot to go around so lovely situation and again the cream on the bottom really does add to the overall experience with this one because it adds a little bit more of that creaminess to the citrus flavors that you're getting anyway so delicious stuff yeah definitely an awesome secret menu type of item over here at Taco Bell and speaking of secret menu I've actually got a couple in my taco bell playlist which I think you're probably gonna want to take a look at if you haven't already the Superman burrito and The Incredible Hulk burrito definitely check those out a lot of fun effects definitely had a lot of fun putting those together so I'm really glad to add this one to the portfolio naturally because technically I guess it a secret menu because it's not officially available but you can have in made since it's on the menu with all the other flavors separate so good stuff easy recommendation a very very tasty summer drink and I think with that said we'll just give this one a rating the obvious rating it's not gonna be a 10 out of 10 I'm just going to tell you right now but it's close so the tie-dye whip freeze over here at Taco Bell the secret menu item it's gonna get a pretty rock-solid 9 out of 10 a little too sweet for me just a little bit it wouldn't be something I would get again but just to try this one time with that creamer was the incentive to do that naturally along with the visual look because I was very curious about the tie-dye effect so it definitely satisfied but as it stands the pineapple whip freeze is easily my favorite right now definitely something you'd want to check out and you probably have already at this point all right now the obvious question at least to me anyway is if you've already tried the pineapple whip freeze over here at Taco Bell how excited are you to blend it with that Mountain Dew Baja blast and that wild strawberry drop those comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K closing out another episode of peep this out bringing you brand-new content every single week here on my channel so while you stay tuned for that next review coming real soon
