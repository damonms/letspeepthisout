 welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty hey everyone its Ian K for peep this out reviews back out it on over at taco bell to go in on something that I haven't had in literally over thirty years and some of you nostalgic peeps are probably gonna recognize it right away that's right and as you obviously know it's the Mexican pizza a mainstay on the menu for many many years guys looking really really nice featuring two crispy flour tortillas that they call pizza shells in between them we've got some seasoned beef we've got some refried beans a Mexican pizza sauce that's unique to this item diced tomatoes and a three-cheese blend so looking really really nice I have to admit the presentation looks really solid and it does feel kind of hefty which is kind of nice as well now granted I know what most of these ingredients taste like I mean it's Taco Bell naturally but the wild card for me because like I said it's been over thirty years since I've had this I don't remember it at all is that pizza sauce the Mexican pizza sauce very excited to see what that's gonna bring to the party with this so before I confirm what it does actually bring in like always if you

content drops every week well I was very surprised to see them cut this in fourths here guys so I've got four little pieces here little quadrant slices if you will let me see if I can grab one of them and it is definitely messy definitely cheesy lemme lift this up for you it's kind of falling apart as we speak but look at this here the Mexican pizza it's been a very very long time here at taco bell let's do it mmm it actually tastes like pizza sauce that's pretty tasty but of course the flavoring of the beef the refried beans it's definitely taco bell and the cheese on top let's keep going mmm oh man this is really good this is really good I'll definitely pepper this review with some more close-ups but naturally as you guys can see I know it's kind of contrasty right there there we go the cheese itself could be just a little bit more melted on some of it there but it is fairly decent on the top of the whole thing the crispiness of those tortillas definitely nice but again the wild-card is that pizza sauce it has a little bit of an Italian vibe and I like that because it dovetails nicely into the flavors of Taco Bell in general the seasoned beef that we already know the refried beans definitely pretty tasty yeah that's actually pretty good and again the size is pretty nice on this it's a nice sized platter and I do like the fact that it's a double decker style so let me try and lift another one of these pieces up here a little on the messy side I'll do the best for you yeah this is really really messy but let me see if I can give you another fast close up like this as you can see we've got that meat we've got that beef goodness on the inside there the refried beans the diced tomatoes I'm not really tasting because of the nice pungent flavor of that Italian sauce that Mexican pizza sauce has a little bit of spices to it just a little bit it really feels like it's got the flair of like the Mexican stuff that we're used to here at Taco Bell at least in terms of how that is with the burritos and then you have a little bit of that tomato type goodness almost like basilly if anything there but it really is pretty tasty and I love the fact that the blend of cheese on top looks more like mozzarella even though it's not it's just the regular three cheese blend but very tasty mmm yeah I don't know why I haven't gotten this in all these years but it's on the menu for a reason it's never gone away now I think I know why so definitely tasty on this one again presentation is lovely plenty of cheese on top there's no shortage of it there and of course it's the classic flavors that you know and love from Taco Bell all those flavors in there lemme give you one more close up of this one before we round this one out and as you can see lemme focus that in even with those tomatoes on there it is not bad and the crispiness of the pizza shells the aka pizza shells from the tortillas that these are it's just flour tortillas it's pretty decent but guys a nice recommendation if this is a favorite of yours you already know what to expect from it there this is really really good so definitely glad to give this one a go officially on camera for you and to scratch this one off the bucket list that's definitely awesome too well at the end of the day it's definitely the flavors that you know and love from Taco Bell just with a little bit of extra goodness from that Mexican pizza sauce I'm really surprised they don't do anything else with something like that on some of the other ones I'd love to see like a Mexican pizza burrito or something like that with maybe mozzarella actually in there that would be a nice combination but as this is for the first time in over 30 plus years I'm glad to finally give this one a shot and it is definitely worth your time price point is not too bad either about $3.99 to $4.20 depending from where you are and again the flavor is classic Taco Bell what's really not to like about that so with that said I'm gonna have to give the Mexican pizza the first time in a very long time for me here at Taco Bell a pretty decent 8 out of 10 again it's exactly what you'd expect from Taco Bell but again that wild card is the Mexican pizza sauce that's a huge selling point with this one and again I'm really surprised they don't do anything else with that pretty tasty stuff definitely okay now the obvious question is do you think this one is personally tasty is this a favorite of yours over the years have you had this recently drop some comments down below let me know if this is something that you get on the regular and if you do is there anything that you do to it differently like adding different ingredients taking things off putting things on what would you recommend for this one to really take it up a notch drop those comments down below and definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K closing out another episode of peep this out bringing you brand-new content every single week here on my channel
