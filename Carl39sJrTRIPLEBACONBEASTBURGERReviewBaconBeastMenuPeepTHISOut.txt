 hey everyone welcome or welcome back to the  channel it's Ian K cheaters cam style after   hours over at carl's jr to go in a little of  what they're calling their bacon beast menu   but on the real what i'm really wondering about  is if this all new bacon beast burger is really   just a rebranded famous star with cheese with the  good stuff and while there's nothing wrong with   that whatsoever i really want to know if it's a  little bit more special than that so stay tuned   because i'm going to be tripping up on the fun  that's right it's the all new triple bacon beast   burgers so stay tuned because it's up next welcome  to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty all right so you ready for it because i definitely  am guys this thing looks freaking beautiful right   now let's peep this out feast your eyes on the  triple bacon beast burger here at carl's jr   and i gotta say this really is a thing of beauty  the lettuce looks amazing with this on top of all   of that beef guys a very cool presentation indeed  so far yes sir it's definitely looking like flavor   lit by fire with this one guys starting off with  that toasted sesame seed bun let's take a look   underneath and see what we've got here and   starting us off it looks like a little bit of   mayo and some special sauce and it looks like  it's mixed with a little bit of ketchup but as   we pan down take a look at the two full strips of  bacon we got with this one guys and that's all on   top of three 100% all beef patties each separated  with a slice of american cheese and i am totally   digging that you can really see the nice denseness  of that 100% beef and it's looking pretty banging   underneath it and for added color it  looks like we've got a nice portion   of lettuce tomatoes onions and as we go  further on underneath it looks like three   solid crunchy looking pickles along with two more  strips of bacon here guys so four strips in total   and i gotta say it's really rounding out this  burger pretty nicely the presentation is killer   and again i can't wait to get into this this  is looking pretty dynamite and very sizable   so yeah it looks like it has a lot in common with  the famous star because that's essentially what   this is with the extra meat and the extra  slices of bacon but guys even still this   has kind of given me a vibe of the monster angus  thick burger from a while back which i had a lot   of fun checking out as well take a look at that  review popping up on your screen here right now   this looks like that burger with all the greenery  of the famous star naturally but plenty of cheese   plenty of beef let's just see if this one's gonna  deliver how could it not here we go guys it's   the all new triple bacon beast burger over here  carl's jr after hours on cheaters cam let's do it bacon wow that was a pretty heavenly first bite  along with a nice little mouthful of bacon so   as this tries to stay focused hopefully you're  gonna see it's nice and crispy looking here let   me just pull it back it's only two extra slices  than normal but even still you're getting a lot   of bacon flavor with this let's keep going  in guys this is pretty good mmm banging check that out it's what carl's jr and hardee's  does best guys feast your eyes on all of that   charbroiled beef absolutely an amazing situation  here and the flavor of all the other condiments   here of course are lighting it up it's a super  famous star so to speak kind of like a cross   between the superstar and the famous star but  with a few extra pieces of bacon but even still   i'm digging it because the beast name is only  warranted if you ask me on the triple you can   get this in a double or a single but the triple is  the way to go if you really want to take this one   up a notch and keep the namesake legit bacon  beast burger that's what this is the triple   so yeah i'm not really hating on this one i mean  had this come out around halloween time i get   the whole monster angus thickburger angle this  is kind of the beast burger that this should   have been because it's got the height it's  got the weight it's got everything in terms   of flavor with this one and the color on top of  it it's a very beautiful looking burger guys i   mean all the vegetables on this really jump out  at you and i have to say when you combine that   with the charbroiled beef a lovely situation  so another couple of bites that's going on in   it i think i pretty much know everything i  need to about this one but it's very hearty   and a lot of fun to check out after hours  right now let's keep going in pretty good you know as i'm enjoying this right now on camera  with you guys let me just send a huge shout out   over to gabriel and the rest of the peeps holding  it down on my local carl's jr here in pasadena   california guys thank you so much for doing what  you do especially late night it is absolutely   appreciated i got to tell you i really don't know  what i would be doing right now otherwise possibly   reviewing something different but i'm glad i'm  reviewing this right now i'm glad to have seen   you guys over there it was great chatting with  all of you in the drive-through very very good   stuff on this one guys and again a very beautiful  situation this looks crazy from the back actually   take a look at this let me try and keep that  focus it's going to kind of go in and out just   a little bit here come on lock in lock in but  you can kind of see what i'm talking about right   there it is absolutely lit up there we go with  three patties we got this cheese in between there   that hickory smoked applewood bacon action just  a lovely situation again the greenery is just   crazy on this one here so i pretty much know all  i need to know about this one like i said let's   just wrap this review up with a rating coming  up next after this next bite but guys again a   lot of fun to check out super late night and again  a lot of tasty goodness the beast's name only on   the triple as far as i'm concerned you can do the  double or the single but this is really where the   namesake comes in with plenty of bacon pretty good  stuff one more bite we'll close it out hang on you know aside for all the tasty looking meat and  cheese you're looking at here right now let's not   forget about those nice crunchy pickles on the  bottom they add a nice little accent of acidity   snap and crunch this whole package here and again  when you combine that with all the flame broiled   goodness that you're seeing here guys this is  really something special lots of cheese lots   of beef two extra pieces of bacon than normal so i  get where they're getting the name the bacon beast   menu but it's really only because of the thickness  of the burger that i've got right now that that   beast name is really warranted but still very  tasty for a super famous star triple really really   nice all right so with that said i'm gonna have to  give the triple bacon beast burger aka the super   famous star aka the superstar with cheese with  extra bacon aka the monster angus thick burger   with greenery whatever you want to call it it's  still a massive burger with a few extra pieces of   bacon still pretty tasty i'm gonna have to give  it a pretty decent 7.5 out of 10   the only thing that kind of kills it is the price  point just a little bit as just over 12 bucks   it's kind of up there in terms of the pricing  but you do get what you pay for technically   the quality is pretty high it's a thick burger  it's a pretty large burger and it's got a lot   of the good stuff on there that you'd want to  have on a cheeseburger especially if you want   to enjoy it after hours which i'm totally doing  right now pretty fun to check out guys and like   i said aside from the price point delicious stuff  all right question time aside from asking you what   you thought about how the presentation of this  one actually looked to you right now in my review   because i ventured i guess you probably thought  that was pretty killer looking i mean i did do   me a quick favor drop some comments down below the  main thing i want to ask you is would you pay over   12 bucks for something like that did that actually  look worth it to you drop those comments down   below and definitely let me know and with that  this is Ian K closing out another high quality   foodie feature for you here on peep this out  reviews cheaters cam style after hours bringing   you brand new content every single week here on my  channel so while you stay tuned for that next review   coming real soon in the meantime stay frosty  yes sir i do love me a nice charbroiled burger   especially after hours but in triple form it's a  little glutinous but still a lot of fun to check   out i hope you guys enjoyed this review i had a  lot of fun putting this one together for you all   right everyone until next time i'll talk to you
