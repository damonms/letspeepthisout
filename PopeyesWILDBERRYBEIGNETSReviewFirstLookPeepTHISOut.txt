 hey everyone and welcome or welcome back to the  channel it's Ian K where today i'm over at popeyes   to check out a new sweet treat that's available  at select locations for a limited time only   that's right and you already know so stay tuned  because the wild berry beignets are up next   welcome to peep this out  reviews with Ian K stay frosty all right right off the break let me just say  i am super glad that i have got powdered sugar   on these beignets this time around because the  very first time i tried these when they were   filled with chocolate when they debuted i had  literally nothing on them and there was really   literally nothing on the inside of them either  but guys this is looking pretty great feast your   eyes on the wild berry beignets a nice sugary  situation of fried goodness we've got here guys   and of course i think the flavor is definitely  gonna deliver let's break this one down real quick   all right so what we've got here is a three  pack of french style pastries filled with a   sweet wild berry sauce and then coated with  plenty of powdered sugar and as you guys can   see by this cross-section shot by the one that  i have split here this is looking fairly decent   on the inside guys i have to admit the aroma in  my car is definitely powdered sugar and a light   berry scent as well but i'm definitely digging the  fried goodness that we've got here and considering   $1.99 for a 3 pack for what i've got here  right now and they're freshly made as well so   not bad all right so let's not waste any more  time on this one this is the all-new wild berry   beignets at select locations for popeyes let's  peep out this flavor yes sir i'm so glad these   are actually doused in powdered sugar their  presentation is definitely killer and i got   to be honest as well i almost thought about  doing this review outside but considering how   windy it is right now and considering how much  powdered sugar i have on these right now that   would have been a no bueno situation so let's  confirm hopefully what's going to be pretty   tasty on this one it's the all-new wild berry  beignets here at popeyes let's peep this out whoa i inhaled a bunch of powdered sugar there ooo that doughy goodness on the inside oh yeah well  right off the break like i said these are freshly   made and guys on the inside is nice pillowy  goodness this is looking ridiculous it's tasting   ridiculous and as it stays focused hopefully  you're gonna see a very decent amount of that wild   berry sauce it's not overly sweet believe it or  not i'm getting more sweetness from the powdered   sugar but i love the preserve that they have on  the inside of this one it kind of tastes like a   puree type of raspberry but guys very very tasty  so far let's keep going this is pretty banging wow all right i take that back it's actually very  sweet on the inside i got more of that wild berry   sauce it's good yeah man as we're getting further  in you're gonna see a lot more of that wild berry   sauce and guys i have to admit this is so much  better than the chocolate beignets at least my   experience the first time around this has a  lot more on the inside and the powdered sugar   goodness is going beautifully with it along  with the light doughiness that i'm getting from   the inside of the beignet itself it's soft it's  pillowy and it has a very nice donut-like texture   and just the aroma in general everything  is just setting this one off very nice   you know on the real i'm not really one to really  get down with jelly filled donuts personally i   mean i kind of like the standard donuts that type  of thing but anything that's pastry filled like   this and when it's nice and doughy-like i have  to admit i'm digging the quality of what i've got   here right now it's kind of converting me over and  let me also say the experience was definitely lit   up pretty nicely just by looking into the bag  i mean guys i had a decent amount of powdered   sugar when i opened this one up before starting  the filming on this and i have to say again   i'm so glad i have powdered sugar this time out  because it's adding so much to what a beignet is   as it should because that's why they put it on  there but guys again a very lovely situation   let's go for another couple in this one guys i am  totally digging the flavor of it it's pretty tasty mmm that's a hearty little sucker so yeah guys let  me just say this is a really nice variant of the   beignets over here at popeyes and considering  they can pretty much fill these with any type   of fruit that they've done with any of their  fried pies in the past i can almost guarantee   we're gonna see so many more different variations  of these down the road i think this is just the   beginning a very nice combination of goodness  already outside of the chocolate version this   is definitely the better one i gotta be honest  guys there's only two but this is definitely the   better of the two in my opinion anyway all right  so let's go for one more bite just to knock off   this little piece here right now and then we'll  close the review up with the rating coming up   next but guys again a very very tasty snack  over here at popeyes and three for two bucks   not a bad deal definitely you can go for the  six or the 12 if you'd like to do that as well   but for me personally i think three is spot on  one last bite and then we'll finish it out hang on yes sir these are fried perfectly with a  very solid amount of powdered sugar to go   with guys and as you can see on the inside a  fairly decent amount of that filling as well   these are very hearty very tasty and again  a very nice combination of fruity goodness   even coming from somebody who doesn't  really get down with jelly filled donuts   i'm getting that vibe but this is  so much different so much better   and plenty of the powdered sugar is really  helping this one along very tasty indeed all right so with that said i'm gonna have to give  these all new wild berry beignets here at popeyes   a pretty awesome 9 out of 10 guys i'm telling  you coming from someone who's not down with jelly   donuts like i was mentioning to you that actually  is very very tasty a very solid amount of that   wild berry sauce the further you get in and the  fact that they were freshly made which is the   caveat with that one you want to make sure you get  them right out of the fryer that is definitely a   beautiful situation when you do and of course  doused in powdered sugar i'm so glad to have   gotten that i know i'm killing that one to death  by mentioning it constantly but guys considering   my experience the first time out with these this  is a major major upgrade and i gotta say the   quality across the board pretty banging not bad  for two bucks i mean a three spot i think is all   you really need but a very nice add-on to anything  you get over here at popeyes hopefully these will   be out a little bit more widespread in the future  because i can easily see different versions of   those down the line like i mentioned earlier  pretty awesome stuff all right so if you happen   to be living in a market that actually has these  available in the popeyes close to you drop some   comments down below let me know what you thought  of these and for those of you who haven't
