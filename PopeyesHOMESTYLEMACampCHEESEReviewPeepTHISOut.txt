this one not just in the awesome presentation but   in the aroma guys there are rich hints of cheddar  cheese in the air right now and i gotta admit this   is looking pretty inviting already all right so  what this cheesy goodness consists of is standard   elbow pasta mixed up with real butter and cream  and then topped off the shredded cheddar cheese   before it's baked to a nice golden brown guys and  i gotta say that crust is looking pretty amazing   on the very top there i love the way it looks  and i gotta say with the oils on the very top   that you can see right there i have a feeling this  is gonna be very flavorful if not aromatic because   like i said it is very strong in that shredded  cheddar department it really smells pretty awesome   all right so let's not waste any more  time on this one we got to get into it   this is the all new home style mac and cheese  here at popeyes let's peep out this flavor   all right so right off the break let me just say  mac and cheese is
