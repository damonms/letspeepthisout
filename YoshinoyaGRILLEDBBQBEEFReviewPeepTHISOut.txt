 hey everyone it's Ian K for peep this out reviews and I'm back at it on over at Yoshinoya to take a look at their latest promo so stay tuned because that grilled BBQ beef is up next welcome to peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty so here we go with the grilled BBQ beef here at Yoshinoya and right off the bat I am really digging the portion size on the very top of this bowl guys this is looking really appetizing and those onions look pretty awesome as well kind of thick cut and fairly plentiful what we've got here is some grilled beef mixed with those onions and then basically mixed together with a sweet and spicy Asian barbecue sauce very lovely situation there and some light garnish of sesame seeds as you can see there as well decided to go with brown rice with this one you can actually go with white rice or what they call not so fried rice which is basically kind of like a vegetable mix a nice situation but overall the situation I'm looking at here is looking nice really really good a decent amount of that sauce it looks like but there's plentiful amounts of that beefy goodness mixed into this one here guys so let's not waste any more time I really want to get into this one let's see if the flavors gonna deliver it's the grilled BBQ beef here at Yoshinoya let's peep out this flavor yeah this thing is pretty hefty and it's burning hot right now guys this is literally like minutes old so it is ultra ultra fresh and I got to say again the presentation of what I'm looking at here looks really really amazing that beef is plentiful the onions all that good stuff there and of course the brown rice the mixture I can't wait to get into this right now and I'm gonna do just that but first things first if you guys are fans of high quality delicious looking food reviews make sure to hit that subscribe button down below and don't forget to tap that Bell icon so you could be notified as soon as brand-new content drops every week guys it's the grilled bbq beef bowl here at Yoshinoya let me go for a little bit of everything here including some of that rice and the one thing about the beef here at Yoshinoya it's kind of on the stringy side and i really like that look at that that is a lovely situation right there let's go for a nice big chunk I think I've got everything here let's do it mmm it's almost got like a velvety creamy type of texture and then the spiciness of that barbecue sauce that Asian barbecue sauce is coming up but that is really wow that is very flavorful it feels like it's kind of kicking in more as I'm going with it here but so far so good and the rice let me grab a little that they're brown rice action a little bit more of that beefy goodness right there nice and stringy let's do it hmm yeah this is a bangin bangin bowl right now guys a bangin bowl really really good and you know what look at these onions like I said they're not slivered onions they're nice and thick just a lovely situation we try and focus that in right there nice and crunchy and they have a really really nice oniony type of flavor you'd expect them to be because they're fresh onions naturally hmm yeah that is so good and guys again the beef action on this one is really really tasty you're gonna get a bunch of close-ups as I'm going but as you can see a little bit of the spices on that sauce it's kind of like your prototypical Asian type of barbecue sauce it's got that flair it's definitely getting the job done in terms of the overall flavor and the mixture of it on top of the beef I gotta say is a lovely situation and brown rice for me I kind of prefer because it feels almost more like a a creamier type of rice it's not like standard white rice and don't get me wrong I do like white rice as well but I kind of prefer just the protein aspect of brown rice and just the overall textural you know effect of what it gives to everything else here but guys with the barbecue sauce with the beef situation and again I'm gonna bring you on in here it is just a lovely lovely situation indeed I'm really enjoying this right now and it is really delicious mmm I'm so glad I'm doing this right now on camera in front of you guys I love experiencing these newer type of dishes for these reviews here on my channel it's just so much fun to do and again the onion aspect of everything we've got going here and of course the brown rice goodness guys just overall a very very delicious Bowl and again a little bit of a hefty one still it's really a decent amount of rice that you have here but fortunately there's a lot of beef to go with a lot of onions the sauce and I can't really tell anything with these sesame seeds that they've got on here for garnish for presentation it looks cool but naturally the star of the show is easily gonna be that beefy goodness let me go for one more quick bite of this one here and we'll close this one out after the rating but guys just a lovely lovely situation indeed and definitely something to check out if you've got a Yoshinoya in the area this is really delicious stuff let's go for another bite we'll finish it up but of course you're gonna get one more close-up before we do that let's do it hmm yes sir definitely some delicious stuff over here at Yoshinoya it's their classic beef that I think a lot of people already know and love from yoshinoya just grilled up very nicely and mixed in with that Asian spicy barbecue sauce that really goes a long way to really taking this one up a notch here mixing it with your choice on the bottom whether it's white rice brown rice or they're not so fried rice this is definitely a lovely situation when I would highly recommend giving a try like you've heard me say throughout this review it's really worth your time yeah this is definitely some pretty tasty stuff and I'm glad I was able to bring it to you here on the channel so overall I'm gonna have to give the grilled BBQ beef here Yoshinoya are pretty rock-solid 9 out of 10 a very hearty Bowl a very flavorful Bowl and like I said it overall satisfied everything that they're advertising with this one that Asian Flair was there the barbecue sauce mixture the spiciness of it that it had as well as just the overall just look of it gotta say guys very appetizing and the flavor did match truly delicious stuff and like I said something you should give a try if you've got yoshinoya in the area okay now the obvious question aside from asking you if you're gonna give this one a shot do me a favor and drop some comments down below what's your favorite type of Bowl when you go for
