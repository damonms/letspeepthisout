 what's going on everyone and welcome back  to another high quality foodie feature   for you here on the channel where  this time i'm over at domino's to   check out a dessert on their menu that  i've always been pretty curious about   yes sir and as you already know it's  their chocolate lava crunch cake so   stay tuned because it's up next welcome to  peep this out reviews with Ian K stay frosty so the box says a crunch on the outside fudgey on  the inside let's pop it and take a look underneath   and as you can see guys the chocolate lava crunch  cake it looks like we've got two of them in here   and i gotta say these are looking and smelling  pretty fantastic all right so very simply what   this is is oven baked chocolate cake with a  molten chocolate fudge center so when this   thing splits apart i'm expecting to see some  real tasty goodness drip out of this one here   on the very top it looks like it's garnished with  some powdered sugar for added flavor so guys this   is already looking and smelling pretty great  and i can't wait to crack this open so let's   get to it it's the chocolate lava crunch cake  here at domino's let's peep out this flavor   all right so i'm really glad i had some supplies  here in the car guys we've got a little plate   action to go with this one so you can kind of see  it just a little bit better and as you can see   oven baked goodness right here guys this really  smells like a very chocolatey fudge brownie in my   car right now almost like home baked cookies  and i got to say i am definitely digging that   the aroma is really setting this off definitely  very tasty looking already all right so truth be   told i'm not sure how this is gonna go right now  because i'm not sure exactly how much fudge is on   the inside of this this is my first time having  this here so i'm just gonna try and split this   slightly down the middle and then i'll hold it up  quickly to the camera and see if we can try and   get some oozy fudgy action coming at you here so  cross your fingers i'm going to kind of get this   ready to go here and again it is very crunchy on  the outside for sure all right there we go and i   kind of see it's kind of doing its thing here just  a little bit let me try and bring this up to you   hopefully that's gonna stay focused you guys  can take a look and see fudgy action hopefully   dripping out because i can't see a thing but  obviously i'm seeing that it's split and it   looks like well nothing is really kind of dripping  out but take a look on the inside that is a very   lovely situation of fudge goodness on the inside  of this one here guys very very cool looking here   let's go for a bite it's the chocolate lava  crunch cake my first time here at domino's oh oh super rich on that wow fresh baked you can  tell oh man let me go for another bite hang on banging wow chocolate lovers dream with  this one this is super thick super rich   wow crazy delicious on this guys the chocolate's  beginning to congeal in the middle of it here it's   very thick very rich and it goes very nice with  the powdered sugar even also with that chocolaty   goodness of the cake itself very rich guys very  delicious and crazy sweet as you'd expect it to   be let me just bring up the other half here and  man this is so crazy decadent guys look at that   just look at that on the inside this is no joke  $5.99 for two of these at first i thought it was   a little too small for each of these to kind of  be like three bucks a piece but these are very   rich very dense and guys a beautiful situation  here let me just continue with this half because   man i really want to finish this one here  look at that crazy good let's keep going in now like i said chocolate heaven wow i'm telling  you this is really delicious well like i mentioned   earlier they looked a little small when i popped  the top on this one for the initial close-ups but   guys like i said they are packed full of the  goodness on the inside it's very misleading   how much chocolate is on the inside of these and  easily it's worth the price of admission it's very   rich very decadent and the crunchiness is on point  with the smooth rich creaminess of that fudge let   me just show this to you again because i got to  keep doing it guys this is crazy delicious if   you're watching this after hours please accept  my humble apologies right now but i gotta tell   you if you've got dominos in the area this needs  to be on your radar just a beautiful situation of   chocolatey goodness and that crunch is amazing  on the actual cake itself it's really nice   all right so let's go for one more bite of this  one guys because i really want to this little   piece is just staring at me here right now and  then we'll wrap the review up with the rating   coming up next but guys after trying this right  now now i think i'm gonna have to come on back   to give that marbled brownie a shout out there's  like something else in the dessert menu that i   haven't tried yet and i definitely want to add  it to the collection along with the cinnamon   twists which i believe i did already but guys super  delicious one more bite we'll close it out hang on well here's a shot of the other one guys and like  i said don't let the appearance fool you this   thing is loaded with fudge goodness on the inside  and of course with that powdered sugar action is   the accent it's a lovely situation but these feel  very heavy very dense and they're easily worth   the price of admission just a lovely situation and  it's baked perfectly very very worthy of your time   and i'm definitely going to be getting these again  delicious stuff so with that said i'm going to   have to give the chocolate lava crunch cake over  here at domino's an easy 10 out of 10 guys like   i said this is a flavor explosion of chocolate  all over the place if you're a chocolate lover   this needs to be on your radar and chances are  if you've made it this far into the review you   probably have already but let me just tell you  again the quality of the fudge on the inside very   rich very decadent and i gotta say the overall  crispness of the outside of it goes amazingly well   with it there with the addition of the powdered  sugar as the accent on top but i gotta say if they   really wanted to improve this one which they really  don't have to do too much with it honestly maybe   adding some little drizzled icing on the top just  for variation in color would be pretty beautiful   you can get the icing on the side but it'd be nice  to kind of see it drizzled on the very top but   guys very decadent and easily worth your time like  i've said it's definitely something that should   be on your radar all right so do me a quick favor  drop some comments down below just confirm it for   me have you tried this one already over here at  domino's i mean it's been on the menu for a very   long time and this is my first time giving it a  shot but what do you personally think of it and   what did you think of the presentation of it here  in the review drop those comments down below and   definitely let me know and with that this is Ian K  closing out another high quality foodie feature   for you here on peep this out reviews bringing  you brand new content every single week here   on my channel so while you
